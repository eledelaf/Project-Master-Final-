Dressed in a fabulous ballgown,
Kristina Rihanoff
looked stunning as she hosted a glitzy party at a Mayfair hotel with her
Strictly
Come Dancing partner
Ben Cohen
beside her.
She was revelling in the moment as she handed out pricey cocktails to friends and members of her PR team. They had helped with a gala event earlier that evening for her children's charity The Dot Com Foundation at the prestigious Mansion House in the City of London.
The 'after-gala' party was a no-expense-spared affair. The drink flowed until the early hours as did the lively conversation among her celebrity friends, including
Emmerdale
actress Lisa Riley.
The venue was the same rooftop room at the Sanctum Hotel where, incidentally, I had met
Meghan Markle
just a year earlier. The intimate venue was not cheap and the bill would have been significant.
The year was 2014 and Kristina, who was still appearing on Strictly back then, had booked herself a suite at the hotel for which she wouldn't have got much change out of £1,000 a night.
Intriguingly, Ben – who was married at the time to his now ex-wife Abby – was at her side despite both of them
insisting publicly
they were not in a relationship. They looked extremely pleased with themselves, perhaps because they secretly knew that the following day Ben would release a statement to say he had split from Abby, the mother of his two daughters.
Kristina and Ben took part in a gala event for Kristina's children's charity The Dot Com Foundation at the prestigious Mansion House in London in 2014
The couple met when they were partnered on the eleventh series of Strictly in 2013
It was ten years ago that Kristina's big night took place – and it turned out to be a memorable night for me, too, courtesy of an encounter with Ben, as I shall explain.
And what a difference a decade makes. Because today things look very different for the pair who began their romance after they were paired together on Strictly back in 2013 - and have now apparently split. Few have become more synonymous with the infamous Curse of Strictly, the cause of so many tears, tantrums, broken marriages and unfulfilled dreams.
Friends have confirmed to The Sun that the pair have parted ways after financial difficulties tore the relationship apart.
A friend told the publication: 'Ben left his wife Abby for Kristina, only to now split with her.
'It's like the curse in reverse. This will be like karma for Abby, she was so upset when Ben left her.
'It's like he has got his comeuppance.'
Cracks had started to show last year after the couple placed their £1.75 million home on the market amid money struggles, which Ben said in court in October had put pressure on their relationship.
The five-bedroom home in Northamptonshire, which was bought in 2016, was put up for sale in October for £1,750,000.
Ben with Abby, the mother of his two daughters, in 2003 - the year they married
Ben pleaded poverty, admitting he was 'fighting to save his relationship and home' after Kristina was caught driving without insurance.
She was slapped with six points on her licence but faced a ban for totting up 12 penalty points after being caught behind the wheel of her £30,000 Audi Q3 in Northampton on April 4.
Yet few, I imagine, will be queuing up to offer the pair much in the way of sympathy.
The truth is it seemed they became very arrogant indeed as a result of the touch of celebrity status and money they had back in the day. This was all-too evident in my chance encounter with Ben and Kristina at the Sanctum Hotel that night.
I was staying there for a couple of nights before I moved to
Los Angeles
for work.
It just so happened that days earlier I had written a story about Kristina and Ben after they had been pictured on a London Tube train in June 2014 – six months after their run on Strictly Come Dancing ended.
For weeks the rumours of their affair had been growing but they had insisted they were not dating, instructing their publicists to tell newspapers any suggestions to that effect were wrong.
However, photographs of the pair told a different story. They showed them cosying up together on the Tube at 9pm after Kristina had attended a function at the House of Commons. Fellow passengers saw Ben slip his arm around the Russian dancer as they chatted away.
Russian-born Kristina is now a yoga instructor and the couple set up a yoga business, although it suffered due to the Covid pandemic

There was little they could do about the pictures. But when I found myself in that hotel bar with the couple that night, Ben clearly felt there was something he could do about me.
I was already in the room having a drink with friends when
Kristina's party arrived – I had chosen to stay at the hotel because its owner Mark Fuller is a friend.
A member of Kristina's party pointed me out to Ben who came over, asked to have a word and led me away, protesting about the article.
In a dark corner, out of eyeshot of anyone else at the party, he shouted at me and told me that I had 'upset his children and ruined their lives'. He then told me he was going to get me kicked out of the hotel. I explained to him that I was a guest, but he didn't care.
He and Kristina – presumably taking advantage of their 15 minutes of fame – asked the owner Mark Fuller to make me leave.
Mark, a mainstay of the Mayfair nightclub scene, was beside himself and told me he feared they wouldn't pay the bill for their lavish party if I didn't.
So he suggested that my friends and I should go off to my room with a bottle of champagne, something I readily agreed to. I didn't want him to lose thousands of pounds.
Later my then boss complained to the
BBC
, which hauled Kristina in to read her the riot act over her behaviour.
She left the show as a professional dancer three years later. Some of her bosses were said to be relieved. She had, after all, already been embroiled in another Strictly controversy when she began dating her 2009 partner, boxer Joe Calzaghe, despite him being in a five-year relationship with glamour model Jo-Emma Larvin at the time.
As for Kristina's romance with Ben, the day after my encounter with him, Ben
released a statement admitting that his 11-year marriage to loyal Abby was over.
The announcement, which I saw when I touched down in LA, read: 'Ben and Abby Cohen have agreed to take time apart to deal with some marital issues but remain fully committed to the welfare of their children.
'There is no third party involved, and Ben and Abby now ask that their privacy and that of their family be respected at this difficult time.'
He and Kristina went on to have a baby, a little girl named Milena, who is now eight. They also had a lucrative deal with Hello! Magazine which charted milestone events in their lives, such as their engagement in 2022.
Since then though, the pair have disappeared into showbiz oblivion.
I wonder if they recall that night at the Sanctum Hotel as vividly as I do. Or perhaps they were just too drunk on fame?

A guide to sauna etiquette for Londoners... here's how not to embarrass yourself
With the opening of two new public saunas in the capital, Londoners are going sauna mad. But do you know ‘sauna code’? Here’s how to get it right

Great news! London has just gained two new public saunas in Camberwell and Walthamstow. For the princely sum of £9.50 an hour you can now sweat it out in Ruskin Park or Sutherland Road following a night at
Corsica
or Drumsheds.
It’s the hot and healthy hangover cure for the quarter-century. Hair of the dog? Never heard of her.
Many have already booked their spot in the bathhouse via a pre-sale – among which were annual membership packages priced at £800. Community Sauna Baths, who operate the outposts, already have two sites in Stratford and Hackney Wick.
Chatting in a sauna? Not welcome
Pixabay
Back in January,
Londoners lined up to try the sweat rooms and cold plunges
of Slow Motion Saunas, another operator, installed temporarily at King’s Cross amid subzero temperatures. Expect these to appear on
Nicky Haslam’s tea towel
next Christmas alongside intermittent fasting and Battersea Dogs and Cats Home.
But like all good things, saunas have rules: ignore them at your peril. The community sauna is its own special minefield: no one wants to see their neighbour as anything more than a name on an Amazon parcel that occasionally comes to your flat by mistake, much less as a real-life person sitting opposite you half-naked. But even your basic gym or health club sauna is a danger zone waiting to happen: a place of tacit, unwritten codes you’d do well to memorise before entering the fray.
If, like me, your approach to the gym involves a little jog, the occasional pilates class and a lot of time sweating it out in a cedar hut, you might also have wondered what exactly constitutes good sauna etiquette. Fortunately, I have done the hard work for us both and come up with a list of dos and don'ts.
The first and most important question:
Should you be naked?
The answer is quite simply no, we are not in Sweden or in East Sussex. Please wear a towel.
What’s an appropriate distance, at peak times, between you and the next person?
The answer is one foot, minimum, ideally two.
What to do if the sauna is full?
Good question. Waiting outside is tricky, and especially if the sauna is near the showers it could give people the wrong impression. Best to avoid the fray altogether and try to go when things are quieter. If not possible, forego the sauna on that day. I know there are a great many health benefits to going seven times a week, but consider the impact which stress and embarrassment have on the body. Looking like a lurker while you wait for a spot is demeaning and a biohazard. Don’t do it.
Do not stare
. If I can keep my eyes off the Adonises (Adones?) who share the sauna with me at the ThirdSpace gym, so can you.
Keep the chit chat to a minimum
. This is not the place for you to discuss work, holidays, your health regimen or your latest sexual conquests. Do not be fooled by the effect of the men’s locker room: no one cares about you pulling Laura from Accounts, nor do we believe you. In fact, the sauna isn’t the place for you to discuss anything at all. Unless you and a friend are the only two people there, you should not be speaking full stop. Use the time instead to meditate and reflect – on your place in the universe, or the glorious injustice of Sir Philip Green’s knighthood. (I stole that from Tom Hollander, but I’ve tried many times and it works).
Heavy breathing is annoying
. Please stop. If you have asthma, keep your sessions short.
Unless you and a friend are the only two people in a sauna, you should not be speaking
Do not raise concerns with anyone flouting sauna etiquette.
If someone has decided to speak or to stare, ignore them. It is by far the quickest way to restore ecological balance. I once witnessed a very angry man take issue with someone for wearing flip flops in the sauna on account that bringing in dirt from the locker room floor was unacceptable. I received a mouthful after pointing out that dirt on the locker room floor could just as easily be picked up by bare feet and enter the sauna regardless. To avoid this kind of a squeamish situation, airpods are your safest option. Plug into a podcast, whale song, even Charli XCX – I don’t care so long as I can’t hear it. Setting your volume above midrange will not be tolerated.
Anything more cumbersome than airpods should be avoided at all costs.
Wired headphones are fiddly and imply the mutual presence of a device inside the sauna. This is dangerous, distracting for others, and should be banned.
Finally, timings: do not be selfish.
The sauna is a shared space and spending any longer than 20 minutes at peak time is a recipe for a riot. I don’t care if your doctor said you should spend half an hour minimum, if you’re meditating or listening to a particularly juicy episode of the Louis Theroux Podcast. It’s not that interesting and Germaine Greer has said far worse on Twitter anyway.
Abide by these rules, and good things will come: eternal youth, cardiovascular health and whatever else it is saunas are supposed to bring you. Inner peace, I suppose. If you see me in the sauna, please do not disturb mine.

Will Microsoft’s acquisition of Activision Blizzard finally bring scrutiny on the video game industry?
This article is more than 3 years old

The video game industry is bigger than the film and music industries combined – yet has faced far less scrutiny than major tech companies like Facebook and Google

M
icrosoft recently
announced
plans to purchase Activision Blizzard – one of the world’s largest video game companies – for nearly $70bn, making it the biggest
acquisition
in tech to date. While big tech always seems to be facing some sort of – usually well-deserved – public criticism lately, the ire has mostly focused on social media. Facebook, YouTube and Twitter executives have all had to
testify
before Congress about their platforms’ roles in spreading misinformation and being used as organizing tools for events like the January 6 storming of the US Capitol. This is all on top of a history of alleged labor violations, including
complaints
that traumatized content moderators are paid poverty wages and
reports
that Black employees face racial discrimination.
Monopoly money: is Microsoft’s acquisition of Activision Blizzard good for gaming?
Read more
Video game companies mirror many of the alleged problems of social media yet have long evaded accountability, outside of the occasional attempt to ban a violent video game. This is troubling given the staggering size of the game industry, which
produces
more revenue than the film and music industries combined and whose biggest hits
make
more money in days than most entire franchises make in their lifetimes.
A series of recent controversies at Activision Blizzard highlights everything wrong with the industry. The latest round of shame began with a 2021 lawsuit filed by the California department of fair employment and housing. The suit
alleged
that women across the company were “assigned to lower paid and lower opportunity levels” and received lower salaries than male employees for similar work. The suit also alleged a “frat boy” workplace culture in which men got drunk at work and crawled into women’s cubicles to harass them. One woman killed herself on a
business trip
with a supervisor who brought sex toys and lubricant with him.
In early December, workers at Raven Software
staged
walkouts to protest what they said were the arbitrary firings of a dozen contractors. The next day at least 200 employees at Raven’s parent company, Activision Blizzard, replicated the protest. In response to the pressure, Activision Blizzard agreed to give contractors modest pay raises and paid holidays. This is all despite net earnings of $2bn the previous quarter and one of their games making the company an
estimated
$5m a day in revenue alone.
In 2019, Activision Blizzard
fired
800 workers, roughly 8% of its entire workforce, despite record net revenue the year prior. November 2021 saw rebellions from both employees and shareholders after a Wall Street Journal
investigation
found that Activision Blizzard’s CEO, Bobby Kotick, was
aware of and failed to respond
to a large number of sexual misconduct allegations, including rape, in the company. The Wall Street Journal also detailed “misconduct allegations against Mr Kotick, including [that] he threatened in a voicemail to have an assistant killed”.
These are hardly isolated incidents within the industry. In 2019, over a hundred workers at Riot Games, a prominent video game company, walked out to
protest
an alleged environment of hostility and sexual harassment. In 2020, women began
posting
on Twitter about harassment, discrimination and sexual assault at video game industry companies and events; one organizer maintained a record of these stories, which have grown to a few hundred. Ubisoft, the makers of Assassin’s Creed, saw a wave of
resignations
and firings following stories of abuse, harassment, and the normalization of sexism and overwork within their offices. In 2021, a report by the International Game Developers Association
found
that 71% of survey participants “perceived inequity towards others based on gender, age, ethnicity, ability, or sexual orientation”.
The behavior of these companies is exacerbated by the same growing monopolization afflicting social media
That same survey found that roughly a third of participants had experienced “crunch”. Crunch refers to long, often uncompensated, overtime that results in employees and contractors working between 65 and 80 hours a week. A 2019
investigation
by Polygon alleged a culture of fear at Epic Games, the creator of Fortnite, where some employees reportedly worked 100 hours a week.
The behavior of these companies is exacerbated by the same growing monopolization afflicting social media. There seem to be fewer and fewer mid-sized video game companies, while larger companies expand and swallow competition. Activision Blizzard itself is a
merger
of two video game giants. Last year Microsoft’s game division, Xbox,
acquired
another major player, ZeniMax Media, the parent company of the developers of the Elder Scrolls games.
This wave of consolidation, Bloomberg News
reports
, could “eventually lead to creative stagnation and other symptoms of monopolization, like limited choices and higher prices”. Electronic Arts, the owner of the Madden franchise, is a great example. The company is only able to put out such terrible football games each year because it used its wealth to maintain an exclusive contract with the league, putting any current and potential rivals out of business.
Steam, by far the largest online store for PC games, has a chokehold on the market. By 2013, Steam had
acquired
75% of the global market for digital PC games. This near monopoly has enabled Steam to get away with the same kind of laissez-faire moderation that allowed white supremacists to fester on Facebook. An Anti-Defamation League investigation
found
hundreds of neo-Nazi Steam accounts, and many posts directly referencing the Holocaust and celebrating famous fascists and mass killers. Despite Steam’s market domination, it reportedly has a tiny paid moderation team supplemented by 13
volunteer moderators
.
The video game industry may not yet have the same power as the leading tech juggernauts, but the industry is not to be ignored – especially considering that other titans such as Amazon, Facebook (Meta) and Google (Alphabet) have recently begun
moving
into the space.
There is another world in which video game employees are treated with respect and dignity, those who create the games we love have control over their workplaces and the products they make, and consumers play comfortably without the presence of Nazis. Until that day comes, the industry must be as scrutinized as its more dominant siblings in tech, and it must be regulated and dismantled before it becomes a new kind of vile.

Former President
Donald Trump
said in new video shared online he will be the 47th president of the U.S. – suggesting not only that he'll run to retake the
White House
, but that he'll win.
Trump made the quip at his Trump National golf course in
Florida
, in a
video
posted by Breaking911.
The former president can be seen on the first tee of his course as he prepares to hit a drive shot.
'You're so lucky to be one up,' says an unidentified man who has a thick eastern European accent and is off camera.
'We'll be lucky if we're up,' Trump jokes at first, sporting his trademark red Make America Great Again hat.
'First tee. Forty-fifth president of the United States,' says the man, providing a bit of play-by-play.
'Forty-fifth and forty-seventh,' quips Trump in response.
'Forty-fifth and forty-seventh,' said former President Donald Trump when an admirer on his golf course called him the 45th president
That prompted nearby admirers to clap as the narrator says 'Yes!'
'I love that,' says another man off-camera.
Trump, 75, then hits his ball with his driver, prompting his videographer and another person to each exclaim: 'Beautiful.'
Trump then follows up with a golf tip. 'You want to keep it low - that wind's stronger than you think,' he says.
Trump, the 45th president, was succeeded by President Joe Biden, the 46th.
Trump has yet to make anything approximating a formal announcement he will run again, although he has made a series of moves suggesting he may, all while strengthening his grip on the Republican Party.
He held a campaign-style rally in Arizona this month, with another planned for Texas Saturday.
'I love that,' says another man off-camera when Trump predicts he will be back in the White House
Trump smacks a drive at his Florida course at the end of the video
Joe Biden is the 46th president of the U.S.
If Trump were to retake the White House, he would be the 47th president as well as the 45th
Trump may face an opponent with low approval ratings he takes on Joe Biden in 2024, although he faces his own challenges, including an array of probes
He has repeatedly attacked Biden from his Save America PAC throughout Biden's presidency. And he he has taken what appear to be swipes at potential GOP presidential rivals – although he called reports of a rift with Florida Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis 'fake news.'
That came in response to labeling politicians who refuse to reveal whether they have gotten their booster shots 'gutless.' Trump himself said he has been vaccinated and boosted, despite a growing anti-vax movement.
Trump's quip about prevailing in 2024 comes as he faces an array of challenges – even as his successor confronts popularity in the low-40s while dealing with combatting the coronavirus, a stalled legislative agenda, and foreign policy challenges.
The House Jan. 6th Committee continues to demand testimony from key Trump allies and former White House officials as it probes the Capitol riot. New York Attorney General Letitia James is demanding testimony and documents from Trump and his adult children as she continues her civil probe. A prosecutor in Georgia has convened a grand jury in her probe of the election overturn effort.
Federal prosecutors have charged Oath Keepers with seditious conspiracy in their own January 6th probe, and a top DOJ official said Tuesday prosecutors were 'looking at' referrals regarding Trump backers who submitted fake vote certifications to the National Archives.

Boris Johnson
and his fellow rule breakers risk being jailed if they lie to officers investigating Partygate, police sources warned today, as Met insiders said they stand ready to use the full force of their powers - including issuing search warrants and seizing phone records.
Detectives will try to obtain material that has been withheld from Sue Gray's inquiry into the lockdown-breaking parties as part of the Met's criminal investigation, amid claims No10 staffers have deliberately withheld information from the Cabinet Office inquiry.
Anyone admitting to attending an illegal gathering is unlikely to receive anything more than a £100 fixed penalty notice, a serving Inspector told MailOnline, but providing false evidence to officers or interfering with their investigation could result in a charge of perverting the course of justice - which carries a maximum sentence of life in prison.
The last politician to be prosecuted under this offence was Labour MP Fiona Onasanya, after she lied to police to avoid a speeding ticket. She was sentenced to three months in jail.
Today, former chief prosecutor Nazir Afzal suggested the Met could also seek to charge senior figures with the similarly serious offence of misconduct in public office, adding: 'I'd be very worried it I was the PM'.
The Met's involvement brings far more firepower to the Partygate probe that Ms Gray could draw on as a civil servant, such as the ability to compel suspects to turn over evidence or submit to interviews.
Sources at the force told
The Times
they would have 'no hesitation' in using these powers if there was any evidence of a cover-up, although only as a last resort.
The investigation is being overseen by the Met's special inquiries team, led by Deputy Assistant Commissioner Jane Connors. She is one of the force's most senior female officers who was embroiled in a row over the policing of the Sarah Everard vigil.

A serving police Inspector, who did not want to be named, said investigators would start by examining the evidence submitted by Sue Gray to identify any suspects and witnesses.
'The detectives will be looking to prove the people who were claimed to have been in the garden were actually there by using evidence from interviews and checking any entry and exit information,' he told MailOnline.
'If the suspects admit to being there, the result will be a fixed penalty notice. But if they deny it then a police supervisor will have to review the evidence and decide whether the person should be charged to appear in court.'
The Inspector said officers could ask a magistrate for a Section 8 PACE (Police and Criminal Evidence Act) search warrant, but this would usually only happen for serious crimes and Covid breaches 'would be unlikely to meet the threshold'.
He said anyone caught providing false information to officers could find themselves in far more trouble than if they had just admitted to the offence in the first place.
'If you say you didn't do it and claim you were somewhere else and show evidence that turns out to be false then you could be prosecuted for perverting the course of justice.

Boris vows he WON'T quit over Partygate as he is savaged by...
Boris Johnson DID NOT tell Cabinet about the Met Police...
REVEALED, the top Met cop who could decide Boris's fate:...
Share this article

'That would be far more serious than taking a fixed penalty notice. You could get a criminal record and go to prison. People need to be aware that their lies could be more costly than telling the truth.'
Nazir Afzal, who served as chief prosecutor for North West England from 2011 to 2015, suggested the fact Dame Cressida had decided to announce an investigation suggested serious charges could be levied.
'Police have policy that says they will not investigate retrospective Covid breaches...,' he tweeted.
'So they must be investigating misconduct in public office and perverting the course of justice - very SERIOUS offences. I’d be worried if I was the PM.'
Sean Caulfield, a partner in the criminal team at Hodge Jones and Allen, told MailOnline: 'If someone was to frustrate or obstruct the police or intentionally mislead them, then they could be guilty of a much more serious offence.
‘Two possible charges could be perverting the course of justice or obstructing a police officer. The latter could include something like deleting messages from a mobile phone or hiding evidence.'
Announcing her decision to the London Assembly's Police and Crime Committee yesterday, Dame Cressida insisted it was never a 'blanket policy' that Covid breaches could not be investigated retrospectively.

The Met's involvement brings far more firepower to the Partygate probe that Ms Gray could draw on as a civil servant. Pictured: An officer outside No10 today
She said she had decided a police probe was now necessary after detectives received new material from Ms Gray's report that showed potential criminal breaches. A total of eight events are believed to be under investigation.
Event organisers could be interviewed while guests would be expected to provide a 'reasonable excuse' for their presence.
Given police have already announced they have been supplied with enough material to launch a criminal probe, which could see him become the first sitting PM ever interviewed under caution.
No premier has been convicted of a crime, and the stakes have been raised dramatically now Mr Johnson and staff are facing questioning from police rather than civil servants.
The Cabinet Office initially suggested yesterday that Ms Gray would hold off publishing until the Met had completed their probe.
But that stance was abandoned after Scotland Yard made clear they had no objection to the findings being issued in full.

How Prime Minister may be interviewed under caution and lying to officers could lead to PRISON: Key questions over police probe
As a result of today's announcement by the Metropolitan Police,
Boris Johnson
may now be interviewed under caution for an offence that carries a £100 fine.
Why has the Met now decided to investigate?
Scotland Yard had said it would not investigate, but that changed after Whitehall ethics chief Sue Gray handed officers the outline of her findings on Sunday – and it revealed potentially criminal matters.
She is also believed to have spoken to police officers stationed at
Downing Street
. They gave what were described as 'damning' witness statements about what had gone on during
lockdown
.
Met Commissioner Cressida Dick said her officers had made their own assessment that the material handed over met the bar for investigation including that there was actual evidence, 'not just someone saying something'.
Which events are the police examining?
Police have refused to provide details but said parties going back two years in Downing Street and Whitehall were being investigated. Scotland Yard is thought to be focusing on eight of the 17 events linked to controversy.
They are thought to include May 20, 2020 'bring your own booze' event for 100 Downing Street staff in the No 10 garden.
At the time, people could only meet one person from outside their household in a public space. Boris Johnson has insisted he thought this was a work event.
Police may also look at June 19, 2020, when Downing Street staff gathered to share cake to mark Mr Johnson's 56th birthday in the Cabinet Room at Number 10.
Indoor gatherings were against the law, although there were exemptions 'if reasonably necessary' for work purposes.
What are the penalties?
These are summary only offences, which do not carry a prison sentence.
They are punishable by fines, which are not recorded on the Police National Computer and do not involve getting a criminal record.
At the start of the pandemic, the fine was £100 for breaking the 'rule of six', which later doubled to £200. Organisers of parties faced fines of up to £10,000.
Anyone who does not pay the fine faces possible prosecution for breaching coronavirus regulations, with a higher fine and criminal record if convicted.
Will PM be interviewed under caution?
If police wanted to speak to Mr Johnson as a witness, he would not be interviewed under caution.
But if the Prime Minister was suspected of an offence, he would probably be interviewed under caution, even if he voluntarily agreed to speak to officers.
Under the rules, a suspect will almost always be interviewed under caution if detectives wish to gather further evidence, elicit information revealing further lines of inquiry or give the suspect an opportunity to answer the allegations.
How long will it take and what will it cost?
Miss Dick refused to set a deadline yesterday. But the probe could take months given the number of parties being investigated, and the numbers of potential witnesses.
As for cost, the investigation into the cash for honours scandal – when Tony Blair was Prime Minister – took 16 months and cost £1.4million.
It found that there was insufficient evidence to support a prosecution. Mr Blair was interviewed three times, but only as a witness.
Are there any legal exemptions?
The Covid regulations were brought in under the powers of the Public Health Act, but some lawyers have suggested the Act doesn't apply to Crown properties.
However, his exemption has not been tested in law, and police have assessed the material provided to the Cabinet Office and decided to launch a criminal investigation.
Are there more serious offences?
If illegal gatherings were organised by officials in public office, it is possible police could investigate them for a separate more serious offence of misconduct in public office. This can lead to a prison sentence.
In addition, anyone providing police with misleading evidence or attempting to manipulate their inquiry could be charged with perverting the course of justice, which can also lead to a prison sentence.

REVEALED, the top Met cop who could decide Boris's fate: Jane Connors was embroiled in Sarah Everard vigil row, denied catastrophe at the Euros and was in charge when officers raved with eco-mob in London
By Bhvishya Patel for MailOnline
The senior police officer leading the investigation into parties at Downing Street is no stranger to controversy.
Deputy Assistant Commissioner Jane Connors, the Metropolitan Police's lead for Covid-19, was embroiled in a row over the policing of the Sarah Everard vigil.
The force faced sustained criticism over a vigil in Clapham held for the 33-year-old marketing executive after she was abducted and murdered by Scotland Yard firearms officer Wayne Couzens.
There was outrage when officers were seen pinning mourners to the ground.
Following the event last March, Miss Connors defended officers saying the force had to 'take some enforcement action as the evening progressed'.
A few months later, she defended the force's policing plan again after Wembley Stadium security was overwhelmed by ticketless fans at the Euros final.

'We police without fear of favour': Cressida Dick's full statement announcing probe
We police without fear or favour. We police impartially. We police in an operationally independent manner. I have investigated more politically charged investigations, and investigations involving members of the government, members of the civil service, and other elected officials, many more than any other senior police officer. I have always done that and will always do that impartially.
I absolutely understand that there is deep public concern about allegations that have been in the media over the last several weeks. The vast majority of the public have acted responsibly. Many people, including many Londoners and my colleagues, have made huge sacrifices and have suffered considerable loss during the pandemic.
Throughout the pandemic, my officers and staff have kept going. They have put themselves in harm’s way to tackle crime, to tackle violence, and to do their bit to help our city in the health crisis.
I would like to explain our general approach before turning specifically to the matters relating to Downing Street. We have throughout the pandemic adopted the approach of the 4Es – invented in London and adopted nationally.
We engaged with people at the time, we explained the restrictions, we encouraged people to adhere to them and only as a last resort we moved to enforcement. In general we have not normally investigated breaches of the Regulations when they have been reported long after they are said to have taken place.
I would like to explain why. It was never a blanket rule but it was our guidelines that in general we would not. We said that publicly on many occasions. Throughout the pandemic our focus has been on what we could do to benefit public health. We police by consent and people need to see that what we are doing has a purpose.
Hence the 4Es approach. Of course, we did issue tickets and we did enforce with some really flagrant breaches. Most people responded very well to our engagement and changed their behaviour. We do have finite resources and even more so during worst period of the pandemic when our officers fell ill as well as other people.
Our view was and is that it would not normally be a proportionate use of officers’ time to spend their time – bearing in mind the nature of the offences – after the fact investigating what could have been thousands of complaints. These are summary only offences. People who commit them get a Fixed Penalty Notice.
I think in general the public would understand that we need to focus on violent crime and terrorism and other priorities, as well of course as doing our bit during the pandemic. But recognising that there might be some occasions where we would investigate retrospectively we generated some guidelines, only guidelines, but guidelines that we have stuck to. We have on occasion investigated retrospectively. Some of my own officers, a few, have received Fixed Penalty Notices when we heard after the fact that they had breached the guidelines.
One or two high profile people also when it was plain that they had admitted and there was good evidence, they also after the fact received Fixed Penalty Notices. The occasions on which we have done that have been where we were looking at something that appeared to be the most serious and flagrant breaches and where three factors came into play and a fourth.
Firstly there has to be some kind of evidence, not just somebody saying something, there has to be some sort of start point of evidence.
My three factors were and are:
- there was evidence that those involved knew or ought to have known that what they were doing was an offence;
- where not investigating would significantly undermine the legitimacy of the law;
- where there was little ambiguity around the absence of any reasonable defence.
In those cases where those criteria were met, the guidelines suggested that we should potentially investigate further and end up giving people tickets. We have a long established and effective working relationship with the Cabinet Office who have an investigative capability and have been carrying out an investigation over the last few weeks.
As a result firstly of the information provided by the Cabinet Office inquiry team and secondly my officers’ own assessment, I can confirm that the Met is now investigating a number of events that took place at Downing Street and Whitehall in the last two years in relation to potential breaches of Covid 19 Regulations.
My officers have assessed several other events that appear to have taken place at Downing Street and Whitehall. On the available information, these other events are assessed as not reaching the threshold for criminal investigation.
Throughout the pandemic the Met has sought to take as I have said a proportionate approach. I should stress that the fact that the Met is now investigating does not mean that FPNs will necessarily be issued in every instance and to every person involved.
We will not be giving a running commentary on our current investigations, but I can assure you that we will give updates at significant points as we would generally do.

One of the force's leading female officers, she has most recently led the force's 'tough stance' on Covid, saying previously: 'We make no apology for our tough stance on shutting down those large gatherings which pose a serious risk to public health.'
In March last year she said: 'I want to be clear, where people have dangerously and blatantly broken the rules, we won't hesitate to take action by issuing fixed penalty notices.'
Commander Catherine Roper, head of the Special Enquiry Team, will report detectives' findings to Miss Connors. She was also involved in the vigil, announcing it had been officially cancelled due to Covid rules.
As part of Scotland Yard's Crime Prevention, Inclusion & Engagement Command, she took a role in Covid enforcement, advising religious leaders not to hold clandestine services after a church minister was threatened with arrest if he held a baptism.
DAC Connors was also the officer in charge when officers were filmed raving with Extinction Rebellion demonstrators at a rave at Oxford Circus, London, in 2019.
A Scotland Yard spokesman said: 'The Special Enquiry Team will lead the investigations. DAC Jane Connors will oversee the investigation in her role as the Met's lead officer for Covid.'
DAC Connors began working in the east London boroughs of Hackney, Tower Hamlets and Waltham Forest before transferring to Westminster to run proactive crime teams, according to a profile for charity Joining Against Cancer in Kids, of which she is a trustee.
She also spent time in charge of call centres managing the Met's 101 and 999 calls, the charity website said.
The profile says she was promoted to the rank of commander in 2018, and by 2020 was in charge of violence reduction.
By late 2021 she had attained her current rank.
The officer will now oversee the Metropolitan Police's special inquiry team in their investigation into alleged rule-breaking Downing Street parties.
The team has been in existence in a number of forms for about 20 years and carries out sensitive and confidential inquiries into matters relating to high profile figures, including those in politics.
It was originally a unit within the Economic and Serious Crime Command that dealt with fraud and corruption offences in the public sector.
But in 2013, following restructuring within the Met, the unit was transferred to the Homicide and Major Command.
Part of its role is to investigate allegations of offences committed by those in public office or on the parliamentary estate.
In the past, the special inquiry team investigated allegations of bribery, perjury, theft, misconduct in public office, perverting the course of justice, electoral fraud and malpractice, blackmail, harassment, malicious communications and offences under the Misuse of Drugs Act.
Last year the lead investigator was embroiled in a row over the vigil that was held for Sarah Everard in Clapham Common.
Police faced heavy criticism and the Met's Commissioner Dame Cressida Dick was under pressure to resign after officers were seen pinning people to the ground and using heavy-handed tactics.
Footage showed officers yelling 'move back' as they shoved protesters away as other demonstrators were hauled off by police.
Crowds of mourners started chanting 'arrest your own' and 'shame on you' as the vigil quickly turned violent.
Following the scenes, DAC Connors said while she understood why 'people need to express their views' the force had to 'take some enforcement action as the evening progressed'.
She said: 'Whilst I understand why people feel the need to express their views at this time, we must remember that we are still in the middle of a pandemic, and that there is the constant risk of transmitting the coronavirus.
'Our officers were once again out on the streets, with the primary role of trying to ensure people's safety during this health crisis.
'Despite many people adhering to officers' instructions to leave the area and go home, we had to take some enforcement action as the evening progressed.'
Her comments came as police federation chief Ken Marsh defended the actions of officers at the vigil and claimed the event had been 'hijacked' by Antifa, Black Lives Matter and Extinction Rebellion protesters.
In July last year the deputy assistant commissioner firmly rejected claims that the Met's operation had 'failed' after crowds of football fans stormed the Wembley Stadium during the Euros.
Responding to the criticism she said: 'I want to praise the quick response by police commanders and those brave officers who confronted these subsequent scenes of disorder and violence.
'I am in no doubt that their swift action prevented any further escalation.
'Frustratingly, 19 of our officers were injured during the course of Sunday's policing operation when confronting volatile crowds.
'I do not accept that the policing operation failed and I standby the difficult decisions made by police officers and the Met's public order commanders.
'Without their immediate intervention, it is possible that this game could have been abandoned.'

The senior officer went on to say that she 'shared the nation's anger' at the behaviour witnessed outside the stadium and reiterated her 'commitment to identifying those responsible'.
DAC Connors added: 'Throughout the course of the day, police officers witnessed disgraceful behaviour both in central London and at Wembley.
'I share the nation's anger at this behaviour. I want to reiterate the Met's commitment to identifying those responsible for the scenes both in Wembley and in central London, their actions will have consequences.'
The officer's comments came as police, security staff and the FA came under fire after thousands of fans were filmed attempting to storm the national stadium ahead of England's Euro 2020 final against Italy.
DAC Connors was also the officer in charge when officers were filmed raving with Extinction Rebellion demonstrators at a rave at Oxford Circus
in 2019.
Speaking at the time DAC Connors said: 'I'm disappointed by the video and the unacceptable behaviour of the officers in it.
'We expect our officers to engage with protestors but clearly their actions fall short of the tone of the policing operation at a time when people are frustrated at the actions of the protestors.
'We will be reminding officers of their responsibilities and expectations in policing this operation - however the majority of officers have been working long hours and I am grateful to them for their continued commitment.'
Party time in Whitehall: The alleged gatherings during the pandemic
Here is a list of the alleged gatherings, which in several cases have been admitted to.
- May 15 2020: Downing Street garden party
Boris Johnson, his wife Carrie, former chief adviser Dominic Cummings, and Mr Johnson's principal private secretary, Martin Reynolds, were all pictured, in a photograph leaked to The Guardian, sitting around a table in the No 10 garden, with wine and cheese in front of them.
Some 15 other people were also in the photograph, but the Prime Minister has insisted this was a work meeting, saying: 'Those were meetings of people at work, talking about work.'
- May 20 2020: BYOB garden party
The revelation came in an email, leaked to ITV, from Mr Reynolds to more than 100 Downing Street employees inviting them to 'bring your own booze' for an evening gathering.

A fridge with the capacity for 34 wine bottles was delivered through the back door of No 10.
According to sources cited by The Mirror, the fridge became necessary for staff's 'wine-time Fridays' which were held throughout lockdown, with the Prime Minister allegedly encouraging the parties to help aides 'let off steam'.
The regular social gatherings were reported to be particularly popular among staff between autumn 2020 and spring 2020 when staff were 'fatigued' with tough Covid restrictions that banned socialising.
Mr Johnson was said to have attended a 'handful' of these gatherings.
- December 14 2020: Party featuring Tory London mayoral candidate Shaun Bailey and staff
Shaun Bailey apologised 'unreservedly' for attending the gathering at Conservative Campaign Headquarters (CCHQ) organised by staff on his campaign team.

He quit his role chairing the London Assembly's Police and Crime Committee after The Mirror published a picture showing him at the gathering.
- December 15 2020: Downing Street quiz
The Prime Minister appeared on contestants' screens at the quiz but insisted he broke no rules.
An image published by the Sunday Mirror showed Mr Johnson flanked by colleagues, one draped in tinsel and another wearing a Santa hat, in No 10.
Downing Street admitted Mr Johnson 'briefly' attended the quiz after the photographic evidence emerged but insisted it was a virtual event.
- December 16 2020: Department for Transport party
The Mirror reported that senior civil servants were 'boozing and dancing' at the event, allegedly planned by staff from Transport Secretary Grant Shapps' office.
A DfT spokesman said: 'Fewer than a dozen staff who were working in the office had a low-key, socially distanced gathering in the large open-plan office after work on December 16, where food and drink was consumed.
'We recognise this was inappropriate and apologise for the error of judgment.'
- December 17 2020: Cabinet Office 'Christmas party'
A number of outlets reported that a gathering was held in the Cabinet Office on December 17.

The Cabinet Office confirmed a quiz took place, but a spokesman said: 'The Cabinet Secretary played no part in the event, but walked through the team's office on the way to his own office.'
- December 17 2020: Leaving drinks for former Covid Taskforce head
The former director-general of the Government's Covid Taskforce said she was 'truly sorry' over an evening gathering in the Cabinet Office for her leaving drinks during coronavirus restrictions days before Christmas in 2020.

- December 18 2020: Christmas party at Downing Street
The claim which kicked off the rule-breaking allegations is that a party was held for Downing Street staff on December 18.

- Run up to Christmas 2020

The Telegraph reported that advisers and civil servants gathered after work for two separate events on the Friday night.
They were to mark the departure of James Slack, Mr Johnson's former director of communications, and one of the Prime Minister's personal photographers.
Mr Slack, who left his No 10 role to become deputy editor-in-chief of The Sun newspaper, said he was sorry for the 'anger and hurt' caused by his leaving do, while Downing Street apologised to the Queen.
The Telegraph quoted a No 10 spokesman as saying Mr Johnson was not in Downing Street that day and is said to have been at Chequers.
The newspaper reported accounts from witnesses who said alcohol was drunk and guests danced to music, adding that it had been told that around 30 people attended both events combined.
