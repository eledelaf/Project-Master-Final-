They had helped with a gala event earlier that evening for her children's charity The Dot Com Foundation at the prestigious Mansion House in the City of London.\nThe 'after-gala' party was a no-expense-spared affair. The drink flowed until the early hours as did the lively conversation among her celebrity friends, including\nEmmerdale\nactress Lisa Riley.\nThe venue was the same rooftop room at the Sanctum Hotel where, incidentally, I had met\nMeghan Markle\njust a year earlier. The intimate venue was not cheap and the bill would have been significant.\nThe year was 2014 and Kristina, who was still appearing on Strictly back then, had booked herself a suite at the hotel for which she wouldn't have got much change out of £1,000 a night.\nIntriguingly, Ben – who was married at the time to his now ex-wife Abby – was at her side despite both of them\ninsisting publicly\nthey were not in a relationship. They looked extremely pleased with themselves, perhaps because they secretly knew that the following day Ben would release a statement to say he had split from Abby, the mother of his two daughters.\nKristina and Ben took part in a gala event for Kristina's children's charity The Dot Com Foundation at the prestigious Mansion House in London in 2014\nThe couple met when they were partnered on the eleventh series of Strictly in 2013\nIt was ten years ago that Kristina's big night took place – and it turned out to be a memorable night for me, too, courtesy of an encounter with Ben, as I shall explain.\nAnd what a difference a decade makes. Because today things look very different for the pair who began their romance after they were paired together on Strictly back in 2013 - and have now apparently split. Few have become more synonymous with the infamous Curse of Strictly, the cause of so many tears, tantrums, broken marriages and unfulfilled dreams.\nFriends have confirmed to The Sun that the pair have parted ways after financial difficulties tore the relationship apart.\nA friend told the publication: 'Ben left his wife Abby for Kristina, only to now split with her.\n'It's like the curse in reverse. This will be like karma for Abby, she was so upset when Ben left her.\n'It's like he has got his comeuppance.'\nCracks had started to show last year after the couple placed their £1.75 million home on the market amid money struggles, which Ben said in court in October had put pressure on their relationship.\nThe five-bedroom home in Northamptonshire, which was bought in 2016, was put up for sale in October for £1,750,000.\nBen with Abby, the mother of his two daughters, in 2003 - the year they married\nBen pleaded poverty, admitting he was 'fighting to save his relationship and home' after Kristina was caught driving without insurance.\nShe was slapped with six points on her licence but faced a ban for totting up 12 penalty points after being caught behind the wheel of her £30,000 Audi Q3 in Northampton on April 4.\nYet few, I imagine, will be queuing up to offer the pair much in the way of sympathy.\nThe truth is it seemed they became very arrogant indeed as a result of the touch of celebrity status and money they had back in the day. This was all-too evident in my chance encounter with Ben and Kristina at the Sanctum Hotel that night.\nI was staying there for a couple of nights before I moved to\nLos Angeles\nfor work.\nIt just so happened that days earlier I had written a story about Kristina and Ben after they had been pictured on a London Tube train in June 2014 – six months after their run on Strictly Come Dancing ended.\nFor weeks the rumours of their affair had been growing but they had insisted they were not dating, instructing their publicists to tell newspapers any suggestions to that effect were wrong.\nHowever, photographs of the pair told a different story. They showed them cosying up together on the Tube at 9pm after Kristina had attended a function at the House of Commons. Fellow passengers saw Ben slip his arm around the Russian dancer as they chatted away.\nRussian-born Kristina is now a yoga instructor and the couple set up a yoga business, although it suffered due to the Covid pandemic\nRead More\nHow Ben Cohen's ex-wife Abby has had the last laugh as star splits from Kristina Rihanoff\nThere was little they could do about the pictures. But when I found myself in that hotel bar with the couple that night, Ben clearly felt there was something he could do about me.\nI was already in the room having a drink with friends when\nKristina's party arrived – I had chosen to stay at the hotel because its owner Mark Fuller is a friend.\nA member of Kristina's party pointed me out to Ben who came over, asked to have a word and led me away, protesting about the article.\nIn a dark corner, out of eyeshot of anyone else at the party, he shouted at me and told me that I had 'upset his children and ruined their lives'. He then told me he was going to get me kicked out of the hotel. I explained to him that I was a guest, but he didn't care.\nHe and Kristina – presumably taking advantage of their 15 minutes of fame – asked the owner Mark Fuller to make me leave.\nMark, a mainstay of the Mayfair nightclub scene, was beside himself and told me he feared they wouldn't pay the bill for their lavish party if I didn't.\nSo he suggested that my friends and I should go off to my room with a bottle of champagne, something I readily agreed to. I didn't want him to lose thousands of pounds.\nLater my then boss complained to the\nBBC\n, which hauled Kristina in to read her the riot act over her behaviour.\nShe left the show as a professional dancer three years later. Some of her bosses were said to be relieved. She had, after all, already been embroiled in another Strictly controversy when she began dating her 2009 partner, boxer Joe Calzaghe, despite him being in a five-year relationship with glamour model Jo-Emma Larvin at the time.\nAs for Kristina's romance with Ben, the day after my encounter with him, Ben\nreleased a statement admitting that his 11-year marriage to loyal Abby was over.\nThe announcement, which I saw when I touched down in LA, read: 'Ben and Abby Cohen have agreed to take time apart to deal with some marital issues but remain fully committed to the welfare of their children.\n'There is no third party involved, and Ben and Abby now ask that their privacy and that of their family be respected at this difficult time.'\nHe and Kristina went on to have a baby, a little girl named Milena, who is now eight. They also had a lucrative deal with Hello! Magazine which charted milestone events in their lives, such as their engagement in 2022.\nSince then though, the pair have disappeared into showbiz oblivion.\nI wonder if they recall that night at the Sanctum Hotel as vividly as I do. Or perhaps they were just too drunk on fame?\nBen Cohen\nKristina Rihanoff\nStrictly Come Dancing\nShare or comment on this article: \n                        My unpleasant encounter with Kristina Rihanoff and Ben Cohen during Strictly scandal exposed their arrogance - and I can't feel sorry for them now they've split: KATIE HIND\ne-mail\n77\nshares\nAdd comment\nComments\n425\nShare what you think\nNewest\nOldest\nBest rated\nWorst rated\nView all\nThe comments below have not been moderated.\nView all\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\nAdd your comment\nEnter your comment\nBy posting your comment you agree to our\nhouse rules\n.\nSubmit Comment\nClear\nClose\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual.\nNo\nYes\nClose\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual\nWe will automatically post your comment and a link to the news story to your Facebook timeline at the same time it is posted on MailOnline.

They had helped with a gala event earlier that evening for her children's charity The Dot Com Foundation at the prestigious Mansion House in the City of London.\nThe 'after-gala' party was a no-expense-spared affair. The drink flowed until the early hours as did the lively conversation among her celebrity friends, including\nEmmerdale\nactress Lisa Riley.\nThe venue was the same rooftop room at the Sanctum Hotel where, incidentally, I had met\nMeghan Markle\njust a year earlier. The intimate venue was not cheap and the bill would have been significant.\nThe year was 2014 and Kristina, who was still appearing on Strictly back then, had booked herself a suite at the hotel for which she wouldn't have got much change out of £1,000 a night.\nIntriguingly, Ben – who was married at the time to his now ex-wife Abby – was at her side despite both of them\ninsisting publicly\nthey were not in a relationship. They looked extremely pleased with themselves, perhaps because they secretly knew that the following day Ben would release a statement to say he had split from Abby, the mother of his two daughters.\nKristina and Ben took part in a gala event for Kristina's children's charity The Dot Com Foundation at the prestigious Mansion House in London in 2014\nThe couple met when they were partnered on the eleventh series of Strictly in 2013\nIt was ten years ago that Kristina's big night took place – and it turned out to be a memorable night for me, too, courtesy of an encounter with Ben, as I shall explain.\nAnd what a difference a decade makes. Because today things look very different for the pair who began their romance after they were paired together on Strictly back in 2013 - and have now apparently split. Few have become more synonymous with the infamous Curse of Strictly, the cause of so many tears, tantrums, broken marriages and unfulfilled dreams.\nFriends have confirmed to The Sun that the pair have parted ways after financial difficulties tore the relationship apart.\nA friend told the publication: 'Ben left his wife Abby for Kristina, only to now split with her.\n'It's like the curse in reverse. This will be like karma for Abby, she was so upset when Ben left her.\n'It's like he has got his comeuppance.'\nCracks had started to show last year after the couple placed their £1.75 million home on the market amid money struggles, which Ben said in court in October had put pressure on their relationship.\nThe five-bedroom home in Northamptonshire, which was bought in 2016, was put up for sale in October for £1,750,000.\nBen with Abby, the mother of his two daughters, in 2003 - the year they married\nBen pleaded poverty, admitting he was 'fighting to save his relationship and home' after Kristina was caught driving without insurance.\nShe was slapped with six points on her licence but faced a ban for totting up 12 penalty points after being caught behind the wheel of her £30,000 Audi Q3 in Northampton on April 4.\nYet few, I imagine, will be queuing up to offer the pair much in the way of sympathy.\nThe truth is it seemed they became very arrogant indeed as a result of the touch of celebrity status and money they had back in the day. This was all-too evident in my chance encounter with Ben and Kristina at the Sanctum Hotel that night.\nI was staying there for a couple of nights before I moved to\nLos Angeles\nfor work.\nIt just so happened that days earlier I had written a story about Kristina and Ben after they had been pictured on a London Tube train in June 2014 – six months after their run on Strictly Come Dancing ended.\nFor weeks the rumours of their affair had been growing but they had insisted they were not dating, instructing their publicists to tell newspapers any suggestions to that effect were wrong.\nHowever, photographs of the pair told a different story. They showed them cosying up together on the Tube at 9pm after Kristina had attended a function at the House of Commons. Fellow passengers saw Ben slip his arm around the Russian dancer as they chatted away.\nRussian-born Kristina is now a yoga instructor and the couple set up a yoga business, although it suffered due to the Covid pandemic\nRead More\nHow Ben Cohen's ex-wife Abby has had the last laugh as star splits from Kristina Rihanoff\nThere was little they could do about the pictures. But when I found myself in that hotel bar with the couple that night, Ben clearly felt there was something he could do about me.\nI was already in the room having a drink with friends when\nKristina's party arrived – I had chosen to stay at the hotel because its owner Mark Fuller is a friend.\nA member of Kristina's party pointed me out to Ben who came over, asked to have a word and led me away, protesting about the article.\nIn a dark corner, out of eyeshot of anyone else at the party, he shouted at me and told me that I had 'upset his children and ruined their lives'. He then told me he was going to get me kicked out of the hotel. I explained to him that I was a guest, but he didn't care.\nHe and Kristina – presumably taking advantage of their 15 minutes of fame – asked the owner Mark Fuller to make me leave.\nMark, a mainstay of the Mayfair nightclub scene, was beside himself and told me he feared they wouldn't pay the bill for their lavish party if I didn't.\nSo he suggested that my friends and I should go off to my room with a bottle of champagne, something I readily agreed to. I didn't want him to lose thousands of pounds.\nLater my then boss complained to the\nBBC\n, which hauled Kristina in to read her the riot act over her behaviour.\nShe left the show as a professional dancer three years later. Some of her bosses were said to be relieved. She had, after all, already been embroiled in another Strictly controversy when she began dating her 2009 partner, boxer Joe Calzaghe, despite him being in a five-year relationship with glamour model Jo-Emma Larvin at the time.\nAs for Kristina's romance with Ben, the day after my encounter with him, Ben\nreleased a statement admitting that his 11-year marriage to loyal Abby was over.\nThe announcement, which I saw when I touched down in LA, read: 'Ben and Abby Cohen have agreed to take time apart to deal with some marital issues but remain fully committed to the welfare of their children.\n'There is no third party involved, and Ben and Abby now ask that their privacy and that of their family be respected at this difficult time.'\nHe and Kristina went on to have a baby, a little girl named Milena, who is now eight. They also had a lucrative deal with Hello! Magazine which charted milestone events in their lives, such as their engagement in 2022.\nSince then though, the pair have disappeared into showbiz oblivion.\nI wonder if they recall that night at the Sanctum Hotel as vividly as I do. Or perhaps they were just too drunk on fame?\nBen Cohen\nKristina Rihanoff\nStrictly Come Dancing\nShare or comment on this article: \n                        My unpleasant encounter with Kristina Rihanoff and Ben Cohen during Strictly scandal exposed their arrogance - and I can't feel sorry for them now they've split: KATIE HIND\ne-mail\n77\nshares\nAdd comment\nComments\n425\nShare what you think\nNewest\nOldest\nBest rated\nWorst rated\nView all\nThe comments below have not been moderated.\nView all\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\nAdd your comment\nEnter your comment\nBy posting your comment you agree to our\nhouse rules\n.\nSubmit Comment\nClear\nClose\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual.\nNo\nYes\nClose\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual\nWe will automatically post your comment and a link to the news story to your Facebook timeline at the same time it is posted on MailOnline.
