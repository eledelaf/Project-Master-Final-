Trump announced that 'numerous people' have been arrested for the 'disgraceful vandalism' of the 'magnificent' statue of Jackson Lafayette Park and also wrote that protesters had defaced the exterior of St. John's Church. In a tweet following violent clashes between demonstrators and cops in riot gear, he wrote: '10 years in prison under the Veteran’s Memorial Preservation Act. Beware!' Police in Washington, DC, used pepper spray to arrest protesters who were trying to tear down the statue while building a so-called ‘Black House Autonomous Zone’ near the White House. ‘Hey, Hey, Ho, Ho, Andrew Jackson’s got to go,’ protesters shouted as they threw ropes around the statue of the controversial seventh president whose figure is depicted on a horse in Lafayette Park. As they tried to pull the statue down, DC police began to break up the crowd and clear the area, according to The Washington Post. At least two people have been arrested for attempting to assault a police officer. Since coming to office in January 2017, Trump aides have sought to draw comparisons between the bareknuckle Democratic president, Jackson, and Trump. Just weeks after he took office, Trump took a trip to Jackson's plantation, the Hermitage, in Nashville, where he paid homage to the nation's seventh president. 'Inspirational visit, I have to tell you. I’m a fan,' the president said at the time.

Chaos ensued as hundreds of protesters were seen locking arms around the statue. With police helicopters flying low overhead, officers used what witnesses said was pepper spray to disperse the protesters. Local reports indicate that between 150 and 200 US Park and DC police moved to disperse the crowd of protesters, pushing them back toward H Street Northwest. Though the statue of Jackson remains in its place, protesters did manage to do damage to the wooden wheels of four replica canons at the base of the monument, according to the Post. Lafayette Park has been the site of noteworthy clashes involving protesters and police. On June 1, law enforcement officers on foot and horseback aggressively drove protesters away from Lafayette Park, clearing the way for President Donald Trump to do a photo op at nearby St. John’s Church.

Trump has proved his adoration for Jackson in his time in office. He proclaimed himself as a 'fan' of the leader, tweeted about him, placed a portrait of Jackson in the Oval Office and even made a pilgrimage to his tomb in Nashville less than two months after being sworn in. While Jackson is often hailed as an important president, he also had a reputation as a slaveholder and oppressor of Native Americans. He forced indigenous people to move from eastern lands on the storied Trail of Tears, that killed an estimated 5,000 Cherokees. In 2017 when travelling to Tennessee to commemorate the 250th birthday of the former president, he said 'Inspirational visit, I have to tell you. I'm a fan,' while standing outside Old Hickory's (Jackson's nickname) Greek Revival-style mansion - Jackson's former plantation. Comparisons have been drawn between Jackson and Trump by his advisers and supporters, with Jackson seen as the first populist president to have been elected to the White House. Jackson is seen as a controversial figure, who was known to have built his personal fortune with slave labor while his time in office led to the deaths of thousands of Native Americans, tens of thousands of whom were stripped of their homeland. Similar to Trump, Jackson styled himself as a man of the people, was already wealthy before his campaign, harnessed the frustrations and anger of working class white people against 'the elite' and defeated the dominant political dynasty of the time to win the presidency, upending the established order in Washington DC. 'They say my election was most similar to his,' Trump said during an appearance in Detroit, where he stopped before heading here for the Hermitage visit and an evening political rally in Nashville. '1828 — that’s a long time ago. Usually, they go back like to this one or that one, 12 years ago, 16. I mean, 1828, that’s a long way, that’s a long time ago.' Following Trump's shock election win in 2017, strategist Stephen Bannon told the Hollywood Reporter: 'like [Andrew] Jackson’s populism, we’re going to build an entirely new political movement. The conservatives are going to go crazy.' When giving the hosts of 'Fox & Friends' a tour of the Oval Office in 2017, Trump gave some reasoning behind putting the portrait of Jackson in the office, although also acknowledged the controversy surrounding the former president. 'They say that his campaign and his whole thing was most like mine. That was interesting... That’s the great Andrew Jackson, who actually was a great general, and he was a great president — but a controversial president,' he said during the tour. During a town hall event in the same year, Trump said 'Andrew Jackson had a great history', although the comparisons to Trump has caused Jackson's legacy to come into question from some. The Obama administration called for Jackson to be replaced on the $20 bill by a picture of abolitionist leader Harriet Tubman, which Trump said was 'pure political correctness' at the time. Pictured: U.S. President Donald Trump salutes after laying a wreath at the tomb of 19th-century U.S. President Andrew Jackson, on the occasion of the 250th anniversary of Jackson's birth at the Hermitage, Jackson's historic home in Nashville, Tennessee, U.S. March 15, 2017 Jackson, America's seventh president who grew up on the frontier, was seen as an outsider and it is unlikely he would have ever become president if not for the Battle of New Orleans, in which he won a victory against the British at the close of the War of 1812. 'The legacy of the battle is that Americans felt Jackson had saved them from the British. That launched the U.S. into an era of national pride,' said Tony Guzzi, who organized the 'Andrew Jackson, Born for a Storm' exhibit at his historical Hermitage home. 'The big, important thing is it really changed the way Americans felt about their country. They were more confident about the permanency of the U.S., which was only a few decades old.' 'Jackson was the next great war hero after George Washington. They put his image on everything from plates to pitchers to coins to you-name-it,' Guzzi said, adding that many of the ceremonial swords, medallions and gold presentation boxes are on display. When he came to power he was popular, so popular in fact that his first inauguration was overrun by drunken well-wishers who tore up the White House furniture. Jackson had to escape from a window while his supporters were eventually persuaded to continue their celebrations on the lawn. Jackson relished fights with political opponents, and is thought to have fought anywhere between five and 100 duels, according to historians. In one, he is believed to have killed a man who insulted him. But his presidency was plagued with controversy. The most famous was the 1830 The Indian Removal Act, also known as the Trail of Tears, which caused the death of thousands of Native Americans and robbed them of their lands. Pictured: The statue of former President Andrew in Jackson Lafayette Square near the White House on June 22, 2020 as protesters attempt to pull the statue down It forced multiple tribes to leave the cotton-rich land, where they had been for generations, to a designated zone on the other side of the Mississippi, which later became the state of Oklahoma. He was also a prolific slave owner and never freed a slave of his own will. His presidency also saw the closure of the national bank and an unprecedented use of the veto that many members of Congress criticized as exceeding his authority. His time in office was also known for the Petticoat Affair, a social catastrophe that began when members of his household and cabinet refused to socialize with the scandal-plagued wife of War Secretary John Eaton. The situation escalated and led to the dissolution of nearly Jackson's entire cabinet. Today, statues of him remain, such as the famous equestrian piece at the center of Lafayette Park, while he has also been featured in Pulitzer Prize-winning biography 'American Lion' and Broadway rock musical 'Bloody Bloody Andrew Jackson.' The portrait of former President Andrew Jackson has also stared out from the face of the $20 since 1928. But it may not be for much longer after a campaign to remove the controversial former president, who was responsible for deaths of so many Native Americans, as well as their loss of life.

No explanation was provided. Last month, as protesters gathered in front of the White House, Secret Service agents rushed the president and his family to an underground bunker. Four DC police officers were reportedly injured after some of the protesters began to throw object, according to reports. President Trump tweeted:' Numerous people arrested in D.C. for the disgraceful vandalism, in Lafayette Park, of the magnificent Statue of Andrew Jackson, in addition to the exterior defacing of St. John’s Church across the street. '10 years in prison under the Veteran’s Memorial Preservation Act. Beware!' Since the May 25 police-involved killing of 46-year-old George Floyd in Minneapolis, protesters have been tearing down statues of historical figures from the Confederacy as well as other figures from American history who at one point owned slaves. Just before the attempt to tear down the Jackson statue, police began clearing tents that had been put up near Black Lives Matter Plaza. 'They were creating a potential safety hazard,' DC Police Chief Peter Newsham said. 'We can’t have people setting up tents on public streets.' Protesters put up a sign reading 'Black House Autonomous Zone' on fencing moved by demonstrators from a construction site into the middle of I Street near Black Lives Matter Plaza Protest medics assist a bloodied protestor as police clash with demonstrators during an attempt by protestors to pull down the statue of former President Andrew Jackson DC police officers subdue a protester during clashes at Lafayette Park in front of the White House on Monday A protester is tended to after he was hit with pepper spray during clashes with police in Lafayette Park on Monday A protester receives medical attention after she was hit with pepper spray during clashes with police in Washington, DC, on Monday Another protester who was hit with pepper spray by police is tended to near Lafayette Park in Washington, DC, on Monday US Park Police are seen above pushing back protesters near the statue of former President Andrew Jackson in Lafayette Park on Monday Washington, DC Metropolitan Police and US Park Police officers deploy pepper spray as they clash with protestors Though the statue of Jackson remains in its place, protesters did manage to do damage to the wooden wheels of four replica canons at the base of the monument A protester who was doused with pepper spray is being aided in Lafayette Square just across the street from the White House Police officers knock a protester to the ground during clashes in Lafayette Park in Washington, DC, on Monday Protesters confront a row of police officers at Lafayette Park in front of the White House on Monday One of the protesters, 24-year-old Frederick Brown, said he was shot with pepper spray by a DC police supervisor as he tried to prevent officers from clearing the encampment, which numbered some eight or nine tents. Many of the tents were used to help a local restaurant feed the protesters, who had been at the site for weeks. 'We put the tents in the street so that cars wouldn't be able to come through, so people could protest,' Brown said. 'They came up here agitating because they want this street open.' According to Brown, who has been at the protest site for at least two weeks, an official from Mayor Muriel E. Bowser's office came to the area just before 2pm and warned demonstrators to clear out, saying it was illegal to block the street. But the protesters ignored the warning, prompting police to begin clearing them out. 'We have been out here every day feeding people for free,' Brown said. 'We have been peaceful overall. It’s not a fight against the government. It’s not a fight against the police. 'It’s a fight against injustice.' Police also had to contend with protesters who created roadblocks using sections of a metal fence and construction barriers. One person posted a sign which read: 'BHAZ: Black House Autonomous Zone.' The sign was an apparent attempt to mimic a similar move by protesters in Seattle who occupied a six-block 'police-free' autonomous zone in response to the Floyd killing. Seattle's mayor says the city will move to wind down the 'occupied' protest zone following two recent shootings, including one that left a man dead.

Nineteen-year-old rapper Lorenzo Anderson was shot and killed on Saturday inside the autonomous zone in Seattle. His killer is yet to be arrested and there are mixed reports over their motive; some say it was a personal dispute, others are calling it a right wing attack Mayor Jenny Durkan said at a news conference Monday that officials are working with the community to bring the 'Capitol Hill Occupied Protest' zone to an end after two weeks. The mayor said the violence was distracting from changes sought by thousands of peaceful protesters seeking to address racial inequity and police brutality. The area has drawn President Donald Trump's scorn. On Sunday night, a 17-year-old was shot in the arm at the edge of the area known as CHOP, named for the Capitol Hill neighborhood near downtown. It followed a shooting Saturday that left a 19-year-old man dead and another person critically wounded. Nineteen-year-old rapper Lorenzo Anderson was shot and killed on Saturday inside the autonomous zone in Seattle. His killer is yet to be arrested and there are mixed reports over their motive; some say it was a personal dispute, others are calling it a right wing attack. Protesters cordoned off the several-block area near a police station after clashes with officers following the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis. Seattle riot squads unleashed tear gas, pepper spray and flash-bangs on large crowds of mostly peaceful protesters, drawing condemnation from many city leaders and a federal court order temporarily banning the use of the weapons on demonstrators.

Its existence incensed Trump, who criticized Seattle Mayor Jenny Durkan and Washington Gov. Jay Inslee, both Democrats. Peacefulness has prevailed during the day. On Monday, people lounged on the turf at a park, while volunteers handed out food, water and toiletries. Artists painted designs on wooden barricades, and a few candles burned in front of a sign on the police precinct listing people killed by officer. At night, however, the atmosphere becomes more charged, with demonstrators marching and openly armed volunteer guards keeping watch. Among the demands are calls to shift funding for police to community health or other social justice causes. Art on the street welcomes visitors inside what has been named the Capitol Hill Occupied Protest zone in Seattle A 1970's-era poster of activist Angela Davis hangs at a boarded up and closed Seattle police precinct Before announcing that the area would be dismantled, Durkan said Monday that 'two nights of shootings have clearly escalated the situation on Capitol Hill'. Durkan's office said in a statement. 'We have been meeting with residents and small business owners to address their safety and disorder concerns, including the ability of first responders to access emergencies in the area. ... As many community groups are also urging, (the) Mayor believes individuals can and should peacefully demonstrate, but the message cannot be lost in the violence.' Volunteer medics inside the zone brought the victims of Saturday's shooting to the hospital rather than wait for the police and fire departments, who were preparing to respond before entering. For the second time in less than 48 hours, there was a shooting near the 'CHOP' area that has been occupied by protesters after Seattle Police pulled back from several blocks of the city's Capitol Hill neighborhood near the Police Department's East Precinct building Demonstrators who had marched to the West Precinct police building downtown were returning to the zone when Sunday night's shooting occurred, police said. The 17-year-old was treated and released from the hospital and wouldn't speak with police, the department said. Investigators urged anyone with information to come forward. Andre Taylor, who founded of the anti-police-shooting organization Not This Time! after his brother was killed by Seattle police in 2016, said Monday that he had warned protest organizers that the city would need to retake the area because of the violence. 'That CHOP area is attracting this kind of activity and it's unsafe,' Taylor said in a Facebook video. 'I told them, 'All those people that were supporting you guys, they're going to start walking away from you, especially all those white people that were following you. ... They don't want to be associated with any part of that violence.' Former U.S. Rep. Dave Reichert, a Republican who previously served as sheriff in the county where Seattle is located, also called on the city to take back control. 'Elected officials have abandoned the rule of law and their oath to protect and defend our communities,' he wrote in an opinion piece for Washington State Wire, a website devoted to state political news. 'They have abandoned their law-abiding citizens and have been cowardly bullied into surrendering the East Precinct - and multiple city blocks.'"", ""Donald Trump is demanding ten year prison sentences for protesters who tried to pull down a statue of former president Andrew Jackson while trying to build a 'Black House Autonomous Zone' outside the White House.

Protesters put up a sign reading 'Black House Autonomous Zone' on fencing moved by demonstrators from a construction site into the middle of I Street near Black Lives Matter Plaza Protest medics assist a bloodied protestor as police clash with demonstrators during an attempt by protestors to pull down the statue of former President Andrew Jackson DC police officers subdue a protester during clashes at Lafayette Park in front of the White House on Monday A protester is tended to after he was hit with pepper spray during clashes with police in Lafayette Park on Monday A protester receives medical attention after she was hit with pepper spray during clashes with police in Washington, DC, on Monday Another protester who was hit with pepper spray by police is tended to near Lafayette Park in Washington, DC, on Monday US Park Police are seen above pushing back protesters near the statue of former President Andrew Jackson in Lafayette Park on Monday Washington, DC Metropolitan Police and US Park Police officers deploy pepper spray as they clash with protestors Though the statue of Jackson remains in its place, protesters did manage to do damage to the wooden wheels of four replica canons at the base of the monument A protester who was doused with pepper spray is being aided in Lafayette Square just across the street from the White House Police officers knock a protester to the ground during clashes in Lafayette Park in Washington, DC, on Monday Protesters confront a row of police officers at Lafayette Park in front of the White House on Monday One of the protesters, 24-year-old Frederick Brown, said he was shot with pepper spray by a DC police supervisor as he tried to prevent officers from clearing the encampment, which numbered some eight or nine tents. Many of the tents were used to help a local restaurant feed the protesters, who had been at the site for weeks. 'We put the tents in the street so that cars wouldn't be able to come through, so people could protest,' Brown said. 'They came up here agitating because they want this street open.' According to Brown, who has been at the protest site for at least two weeks, an official from Mayor Muriel E. Bowser's office came to the area just before 2pm and warned demonstrators to clear out, saying it was illegal to block the street. But the protesters ignored the warning, prompting police to begin clearing them out. 'We have been out here every day feeding people for free,' Brown said. 'We have been peaceful overall. It’s not a fight against the government. It’s not a fight against the police. 'It’s a fight against injustice.' Police also had to contend with protesters who created roadblocks using sections of a metal fence and construction barriers. One person posted a sign which read: 'BHAZ: Black House Autonomous Zone.' The sign was an apparent attempt to mimic a similar move by protesters in Seattle who occupied a six-block 'police-free' autonomous zone in response to the Floyd killing. Seattle's mayor says the city will move to wind down the 'occupied' protest zone following two recent shootings, including one that left a man dead.

Nineteen-year-old rapper Lorenzo Anderson was shot and killed on Saturday inside the autonomous zone in Seattle. His killer is yet to be arrested and there are mixed reports over their motive; some say it was a personal dispute, others are calling it a right wing attack Mayor Jenny Durkan said at a news conference Monday that officials are working with the community to bring the 'Capitol Hill Occupied Protest' zone to an end after two weeks. The mayor said the violence was distracting from changes sought by thousands of peaceful protesters seeking to address racial inequity and police brutality. The area has drawn President Donald Trump's scorn. On Sunday night, a 17-year-old was shot in the arm at the edge of the area known as CHOP, named for the Capitol Hill neighborhood near downtown. It followed a shooting Saturday that left a 19-year-old man dead and another person critically wounded. Nineteen-year-old rapper Lorenzo Anderson was shot and killed on Saturday inside the autonomous zone in Seattle. His killer is yet to be arrested and there are mixed reports over their motive; some say it was a personal dispute, others are calling it a right wing attack. Protesters cordoned off the several-block area near a police station after clashes with officers following the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis. Seattle riot squads unleashed tear gas, pepper spray and flash-bangs on large crowds of mostly peaceful protesters, drawing condemnation from many city leaders and a federal court order temporarily banning the use of the weapons on demonstrators.

Its existence incensed Trump, who criticized Seattle Mayor Jenny Durkan and Washington Gov. Jay Inslee, both Democrats. Peacefulness has prevailed during the day. On Monday, people lounged on the turf at a park, while volunteers handed out food, water and toiletries. Artists painted designs on wooden barricades, and a few candles burned in front of a sign on the police precinct listing people killed by officer. At night, however, the atmosphere becomes more charged, with demonstrators marching and openly armed volunteer guards keeping watch. Among the demands are calls to shift funding for police to community health or other social justice causes. Art on the street welcomes visitors inside what has been named the Capitol Hill Occupied Protest zone in Seattle A 1970's-era poster of activist Angela Davis hangs at a boarded up and closed Seattle police precinct Before announcing that the area would be dismantled, Durkan said Monday that 'two nights of shootings have clearly escalated the situation on Capitol Hill'. Durkan's office said in a statement. 'We have been meeting with residents and small business owners to address their safety and disorder concerns, including the ability of first responders to access emergencies in the area. ... As many community groups are also urging, (the) Mayor believes individuals can and should peacefully demonstrate, but the message cannot be lost in the violence.' Volunteer medics inside the zone brought the victims of Saturday's shooting to the hospital rather than wait for the police and fire departments, who were preparing to respond before entering. For the second time in less than 48 hours, there was a shooting near the 'CHOP' area that has been occupied by protesters after Seattle Police pulled back from several blocks of the city's Capitol Hill neighborhood near the Police Department's East Precinct building Demonstrators who had marched to the West Precinct police building downtown were returning to the zone when Sunday night's shooting occurred, police said. The 17-year-old was treated and released from the hospital and wouldn't speak with police, the department said. Investigators urged anyone with information to come forward. Andre Taylor, who founded of the anti-police-shooting organization Not This Time! after his brother was killed by Seattle police in 2016, said Monday that he had warned protest organizers that the city would need to retake the area because of the violence. 'That CHOP area is attracting this kind of activity and it's unsafe,' Taylor said in a Facebook video. 'I told them, 'All those people that were supporting you guys, they're going to start walking away from you, especially all those white people that were following you. ... They don't want to be associated with any part of that violence.' Former U.S. Rep. Dave Reichert, a Republican who previously served as sheriff in the county where Seattle is located, also called on the city to take back control. 'Elected officials have abandoned the rule of law and their oath to protect and defend our communities,' he wrote in an opinion piece for Washington State Wire, a website devoted to state political news. 'They have abandoned their law-abiding citizens and have been cowardly bullied into surrendering the East Precinct - and multiple city blocks.'"", 'BET founder Robert Johnson has called protesters pulling down Confederate and racist statues \'borderline anarchists\' and said \'black people laugh at white people\' doing it, as Donald Trump prepares to use US Marshals to defend monuments nationwide. Johnson, who became the first black American billionaire in 2001 and has previously called on the US government to provide slavery reparations, blasted protesters for tearing down statues across America and calling for TV shows to be canceled, saying such steps achieve nothing in the fight for racial equality. \'What white people are doing with the idea that they\'re making us feel good is tantamount to rearranging the deck chairs on a racial Titanic,\' he told Fox News Wednesday. \'It absolutely means nothing.\' He said these actions are simply being done by white people to \'assuage their guilt\' and urged them instead to \'ask us what we think first\'. His comments come as the president put US Marshals on standby to help protect monuments across America and vowed to come down hard on any protesters destroying or vandalizing them. Calls have been mounting to take down statues and symbols of racist and Confederate figures amid protests demanding an end to systemic racism in the wake of the Memorial Day \'murder\' of black man George Floyd. BET founder Robert Johnson (pictured) has said \'black people laugh at white people\' pulling down Confederate and racist statues because it is meaningless behavior that won\'t \'close the labor gap\' as he branded them \'borderline anarchists\' Johnson, who says Black Lives Matter should form its own political party, said taking down statues misses the point about the inequality black people face every day in America and that it does nothing to close the wealth and opportunity gaps between white and black people. \'Look, the people who are basically tearing down statues, trying to make a statement are basically borderline anarchists, the way I look at it. They really have no agenda other than the idea we\'re going to topple a statue,\' Johnson told Fox News. \'It\'s not going to close the wealth gap. It\'s not going to give a kid whose parents can\'t afford college money to go to college. \'It\'s not going to close the labor gap between what white workers are paid and what black workers are paid. And it\'s not going to take people off welfare or food stamps.\' Johnson said white protesters are misguided in thinking that black people support their efforts to remove statues, cancel TV shows and fire professors who say \'all lives matter\', saying \'frankly, black people don\'t give a damn\'. \'[They] have the mistaken assumption that black people are sitting around cheering for them saying ""Oh, my God, look at these white people. They\'re doing something so important to us. They\'re taking down the statue of a Civil War general who fought for the South,"" Johnson said. \'You know, black people, in my opinion, black people laugh at white people who do this the same way we laugh at white people who say we got to take off the TV shows.\' Johnson slammed the move to cancel shows such as The Dukes of Hazzard which has been blasted over its use of Confederate flags and the move to put a disclaimer at the start of film Gone With The Wind saying of the former that \'I guarantee you it had more black people watching\' than white. He said white people think they are doing these things as a show of support but they are really only doing what they want to make them feel better about themselves.

The black entrepreneur gave a call to action for white people to stop assuming they know how to tackle the issue of racism in society and to instead ask black people what they want to happen. \'If you want to decide on statues and you want to treat black people right why don\'t you do this - why don\'t you get a group of black people together and say ""before we go knock down the statue of Ulysses Grant or this, what do you guys think"",\' urged Johnson. \'Give us the belief that you respect our opinion. You go out and do something, destroy something, fire somebody because you think it hurts us... why don\'t you ask us first if it hurts us... ask us if we want you to do that to make us feel better.\' Demonstrators protest in front of a police line on a section of 16th Street in Washington DC that has been renamed Black Lives Matter Plaza Black Lives Matter protesters gather in the day Wednesday days after President Trump threatened people with 10 years\' jail time if they damage statues A protester holds his fist in the air in front of the police line in the US capital Wednesday The area of Black Lives Matter Plaza is shown cleared of protesters after a failed attempt to take down the statue of President Andrew Jackson at Lafayette Park on Wednesday The White House is visible behind the Andrew Jackson statue in Lafayette Park, Washington DC, with the word \'killer\' spray painted on its base. President Trump has put US Marshals on standby to help protect monuments across America A \'Defund Police\' sign is hung on the fence put up to try to protect the Andrew Jackson statue. Marshals were told to prepare to be drafted in to protect monuments across the nation, according to an email directive seen by The Washington Post Wednesday ANDREW JACKSON AND SLAVERY By the time President Andrew Jackson died in 1845, he owned around 150 enslaved men, women and children. Jackson amassed much of his wealth due to the free labor, as they harvested cotton on the land surrounding Jackson\'s Tennessee home, The Hermitage. While Jackson died 16 years before the start of the Civil War, he had to deal with the issue of secession during his presidency. South Carolina threatened to secede over what Southerners called the \'Tariff of Abominations\' enacted under Jackson\'s predecessor, John Quincy Adams. This political crisis, the Nullification Crisis, pitted Jackson and the federal government against South Carolina, whose legislature called for a special state convention to adopt the Ordinance of Nullification, which said the tariffs of 1828 and 1832 were null and void. Jackson threatened to send the military into South Carolina issuing the \'Proclamation to the People of South Carolina,\' which asserted the supremacy of the federal government. The crisis ended with Congress passing a bill that would have allowed for Jackson to send forces into the state, but also another piece of legislation that lowered the controversial tariff. Advertisement He added: \'That\'s what\'s missing in this whole thing.\' Johnson even went as far as to say that white America making these decisions on behalf of black people is reinforcing the idea that white people know best. \'To me when I see all of these things - changing names, toppling statues, firing professors because they said ""all lives matter"" it just shows me that white America is still continually incapable of recognizing that black people have their own ideas and thoughts about what\'s in their best interests,\' he said. The debate over the removal of statues has heated up this week, with Trump warning protesters will be hit hard by law enforcement if they take matters into their own hands. US Marshals have been told to prepare to be drafted in to protect monuments across the nation, according to an email directive seen by The Washington Post Wednesday. In the email, Marshals Assistant Director Andrew C. Smith said they had \'been asked to immediately prepare to provide federal law enforcement support to protect national monuments (throughout the country).\' Smith wrote that it was a \'challenging assignment due to the breadth of possible targets for criminal activity\'. A Joint Operations Center is being set up in Springfield, Virginia, to coordinate the assignment and every deputy in the Special Operations Group will be ready to be called in by Thursday, the email read. Smith also called on other districts and divisions to volunteer deputies to help in the effort. It is not clear what the role of the Marshals will be but they have been called on for their assistance until July 8, according to the Post. The unusual move to send in the Marshals comes after around 400 members of the National Guard were activated to Washington DC to protect a statue of President Andrew Jackson in Lafayette Park which has been fenced off after protesters failed to topple it on Monday. Riot police blasted the crowds with pepper spray to prevent the statue\'s destruction Monday and Trump threatened anyone who vandalizes a monument or statue will face up to 10 years in prison. As the question of racist statues continues to divide the nation, Johnson raised the question over whether white people would be so willing to tackle the issue of racism if they were told to pay reparations over America\'s history of slavery. A group of Black Lives Matter protestors prepare banners at City Hall in New York Wednesday Protests have been mounting across America calling for an end to police brutality and systemic racism following George Floyd\'s \'murder\' New York protesters gather outside City Hall Wednesday and organize supplies ahead of a nighttime protest \'If you ask us what will make us feel better and we go ""ok everybody start writing checks starting tomorrow $11,000 every year for the next 30 years that makes us feel better, are you okay with that?""\' he asked. \'To me it falls into that attempt by white Americans to assuage guilt by doing things that make them feel good but if you ask those same white people ""hey guys just write a $350,000 check to black people over the next 30 years, leave those statues alone just just give us $350,000"" you find it goes into ""are you sure they\'re going to use the money wisely? Are you sure that\'s going to stop racism?""\' Johnson has previously called on the US government to pay out $14 trillion for descendants of the slave trade. He also went on to mock white celebrities who have taken to social media to apologize for being white. \'You know, that to me is the silliest expression of white privilege that exists in this country. The notion that a celebrity could get on a Twitter feed and say, ""oh, my God, I am so sorry that I am white."" I don\'t find any black people getting on Twitter and saying, ""Oh, I\'m so sorry I\'m black"",\' he said. Cops stand guard around the statue. Johnson said white people taking down statues is \'tantamount to rearranging the deck chairs on a racial Titanic.

The black businessman penned a letter to the movement\'s leaders and supporters suggesting \'Black Lives Matter (BLM) consider establishing a formal independent political party.\' He wrote: \'The party could be founded on the principle articulated by the founding members of the Congressional Black Caucus in 1971\' of black people having \'no permanent friends, no permanent enemies... just permanent interests.\' \'I’ve been convinced for a long time that 40 millions African Americans who tend to vote as a bloc in one of the two parties limit their leverage in getting action form both parties,\' he told CNBC Tuesday. Hundreds of National Guard troops are called back to DC to protect historical monuments after protesters vow to tear down statue of Andrew Jackson Hundreds of unarmed National Guard troops have been called into Washington, D.C. to help protect historical monuments after protesters tried to topple a statue of Andrew Jackson during a night of demonstrations in the nation\'s capital. US Defense officials on Wednesday confirmed the Interior Department requested assistance earlier this week after demonstrators targeted statues and established a so-called \'Black House Autonomous Zone\' near the White House. Speaking on condition of anonymity, the government sources said the number of National Guard troops mobilized is in the low hundreds and none have been deployed to the streets yet. Protesters were unsuccessful in toppling the statue, but they did manage to damage the wooden wheels of four replica cannons at the base of the monument Photos on Wednesday showed the bronze statue of Andrew Jackson at Lafayette Park behind a high fence reinforcing a security perimeter after protesters tried to tear it down On Monday night in Lafayette Park in front of the White House protesters tried to topple a bronze statue of former president Andrew Jackson and began to put up planks of wood declaring the area a \'Black House Autonomous Zone\' It comes after President Donald Trump pledged to take a hard line on anyone destroying or vandalizing U.S. historical monuments and threatened to use force on some protesters on Tuesday. Photos taken at Lafayette Park on Wednesday showed the bronze statue of President Andrew Jackson behind a high fence reinforcing a security perimeter. Jackson served two terms in the White House, from 1829 to 1837, espousing a populist political style that has sometimes been compared with that of Trump. Protesters were unsuccessful in toppling the statue, but they did manage to damage the wooden wheels of four replica cannons at the base of the monument. Workers were seen removing parts of the cannons that were smashed during the protests this afternoon. Trump had tweeted earlier that he was giving authorization \'effective immediately\' to arrest anyone caught hurting a commemoration to an armed services member on federal land, even though the government already had that power under the 2003 Veterans Memorial Act. Police were already on site Tuesday morning at the Andrew Jackson statue in front of the White House that had been graffitied at its base with the phrase \'Killer\' after failed attempts to topple the monument Protesters on Tuesday attempted to establish the area outside the North Lawn of the White House as the \'Black House Autonomous Zone\' President Donald Trump voiced his fury over Monday night\'s protests, declaring there will \'never\' be an autonomous zone on Capitol Hill as long as he\'s president and claiming those who try to establish such an area \'will be met with serious force\' He later added: \'There will never be an \'Autonomous Zone\' in Washington, D.C., as long as I\'m your President. If they try they will be met with serious force!\' The tweet was later flagged by Twitter for violating \'the Twitter Rules about abusive behavior.\' He also condemned the \'disgraceful vandalism\' of the \'magnificent\' statue of the controversial general Jackson, who Trump has touted as a personal hero, and also slammed people who defaced the exterior of St. John\'s Church. On Monday clean up crews were seen hosing down the statue, washing away graffiti that emblazoned the phrase \'Killer\' on the base of the monument. Police in Washington, DC, had used pepper spray to arrest protesters who were trying to tear down the statue while building the BHAZ - echoing Seattle\'s Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone (CHAZ) that was formed on June 8. Creating such spaces is an occupation protest meant to establish a neighborhood without police. Trump has been vocal about his contempt for the zone, slamming its occupants as \'ugly Anarchists\' while urging the governor and mayor to \'take back\' the area. Earlier this month, about 1,200 DC National Guard troops and 3,900 from other states were sent to the capital to back law enforcement during demonstrations.The National Guard in Washington DC is the only one in the country that reports to Trump, with the authority delegated to the Army secretary. Minneapolis police chief says George Floyd\'s death was \'MURDER\' and believes Officer Derek Chauvin \'knew what he was doing\' when he fatally knelt down on the 46-year-old\'s neck for nearly nine minutes Minneapolis Police Chief Medaria Arradondo has called George Floyd’s death at the hands of Officer Derek Chauvin on Memorial Day ‘murder’, insisting the killing didn’t result because of a lack of training. In his most damning declaration about Floyd’s killing yet, Arradondo issued a statement Monday night, insisting ‘Chauvin knew what he was doing’ when he fatally knelt down on the 46-year-old’s neck for eight minutes and 46 seconds. ‘Mr. George Floyd’s tragic death was not due to a lack of training — the training was there,’ Arradondo wrote. ‘Chauvin had his knee on Mr Floyd’s neck for over seven minutes, and for those last minutes he knew that Floyd was non-responsive. ‘This was murder — it wasn’t a lack of training. This is why I took swift action regarding the involved officers’ employment with MPD,’ he continued. Chauvin and Tou Thao – another officer involved in the fatal arrest - both had previously taken department training to prevent suffocation in people being restrained face down years earlier, the police chief said. In his most damning declaration about Floyd’s killing yet, Arradondo issued a statement Monday night, insisting ‘Chauvin knew what he was doing’ when he fatally knelt down on the 46-year-old’s neck for eight minutes and 46 seconds ‘Mr. George Floyd’s tragic death was not due to a lack of training — the training was there,’ Arradondo wrote. ‘Chauvin had his knee on Mr Floyd’s neck for over seven minutes, and for those last minutes he knew that Floyd was non-responsive\' While State Governor Tim Waltz and a number of other public officials in Minneapolis have previously proclaimed Floyd’s death to be a murder, this is the first time Arradondo has staked such a claim. Department of Public Safety Commissioner John Harrington called Floyd’s death ‘murder’ on May 29, just hours before Chauvin was arrested and charged with second-degree murder, third-degree murder and manslaughter, the Star Tribune reported. The police chief’s statement was released in response to a public records request for department training records after questions were asked as to whether the Minneapolis PD upheld a promise to require all officers to undergo training on the dangers of positional asphyxia, following a 2013 settlement. Arradondo claimed that the MPD ‘went beyond the requirements’ of the settlement – not only providing training but overhauling its policies altogether the following year. ‘The policy changes explicitly require moving an arrestee from a prone position to a recovery position when the maximal restraint technique is used and require continuous monitoring of an arrestee’s condition,’ Arradondo wrote. ‘It is important to note that getting an arrestee into a position where he or she can breathe is something that is hammered into all of our officers,’ Arradondo added. ‘And this began even before the Smith settlement’s required 2014 training.\' He continued by saying there is ‘simply no way that any competent officer in MPD would be unaware of the need to get an arrestee into a recovery position so that he or she can breathe freely.’ Arradondo then broke down Chauvin’s systematic failures to uphold the rudimentary policy. ‘Mr Floyd shouted out that he couldn’t breathe; bystanders shouted out that Mr. Floyd had stopped talking; then they pointed out he had become non-responsive; and finally they shouted out that Mr. Floyd was dying,’ the police chief wrote. ‘Further, one of the officers on the scene told Chauvin that Mr. Floyd should be put into a recovery position and he eventually told Chauvin he could not find Mr. Floyd’s pulse,’ he continued. ‘The officers knew what was happening – one intentionally caused it and the others failed to prevent it. ‘This was murder – it wasn’t a lack of training.’ Derek Chauvin’s lawyer, Eric Nelson, has not yet returned a DailyMail.com request for comment on Arradondo’s remarks. Chauvin (left) and Tou Thao (right) – another officer involved in the fatal arrest - both had previously taken department training to prevent suffocation in people being restrained face down years earlier, the police chief said. While State Governor Tim Waltz and a number of other public officials in Minneapolis have previously proclaimed Floyd’s death to be a murder, this is the first time Arradondo has staked such a claim Floyd was arrested on May 25 after he was accused of attempting to pay for groceries with a counterfeit $20 bill Rookie officers J. Alexander Keung (left) and Thomas Lane (right) were also involved in the arrest. Lane had asked Chauvin if he should roll Floyd onto his side to help him breathe better. Chauvin replied \'No. Staying put where we got him\' Staten Island principal laughs and jokes amid investigation into her \'racist\' Facebook rant about privilege and students wearing $300 BEATS headphones - as 12,000 sign petition for her to be fired The Staten Island assistant principal who is now being investigated for a \'racist\' Facebook rant about privilege was seen outside her home on Tuesday giving food to a black woman while her husband gathered recyclable bottles for the woman. Deborah Morse-Cunningham, 48, is under investigation for a Facebook post in which she claimed people living in subsidized housing and had \'as many children as they wanted\' were privileged. Many deemed it racist and inferred she was talking about black people. She did not make any reference to race in the post. Others supported her remarks and said they were sick of \'people taking advantage of the system\'. They claimed more white people than black people claimed government help, and said Morse-Cunningham was brave for \'swimming against the tide\' with her post. Cunningham has now deleted the post and is being investigated by the New York Department of Education. The school issued an email to parents calling her words \'highly inappropriate\'.

0,807,0_trump_capitol_president_house,"['trump', 'capitol', 'president', 'house', 'said', 'january', 'election', 'trumps', 'biden', 'white']","[""The Republican bid to overturn President-elect Joe Biden's victory ended early Thursday morning after the Senate voted 92-7 to dismiss a challenge to Pennsylvania's Electoral College vote. The vote ended a nearly 12-hour saga that saw supporters of President Donald Trump mobbing the U.S. Capitol, in a violent incident that left four dead. Senators had returned to their chamber to debate an objection sponsored by Missouri Republican Sen. Josh Hawley after midnight. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, who told GOP senators not to engage in this effort to begin with, skipped two hours of permitted debate and went straight for a vote. Hawley was joined by his co-accomplice, Sen. Ted Cruz, as well as Florida Sen. Rick Scott, Mississippi Sen. Cindy Hyde-Smith and newly minted Sens. Cynthia Lummis, Roger Marshall, and Tommy Tuberville. The rest of the Senate voted the Pennsylvania challenge down. Both houses have to vote in favor of a challenge for it to succeed. The Democrat-controlled House is due to vote shortly on the Pennsylvania challenge, but the effort will fail there too. Before Hawley threw the lawmakers back to their respective houses, Biden was on the precipice of the 270 Electoral College he needed: 244-157. Republicans in the House and Senate had also challenged the votes in Arizona - which prompted two hours of debate, interrupted by the MAGA riot - and that objection was overwhelmingly overruled. House Republicans also tried to challenge the results in Georgia, Michigan and Nevada, but didn’t have Senate support. Vice President Mike Pence reopened the Senate by condemning Wednesday's chaotic siege of Capitol Hill 'in the strongest possible terms' - but did not lay the blame on Trump for inciting the MAGA mob. The Republican bid to overturn President-elect Joe Biden's victory ended early Thursday morning after the Senate voted 92-7 to dismiss a challenge to Pennsylvania's Electoral College vote Vice President Mike Pence reopened the Senate condemning Wednesday's violent siege of Capitol Hill 'in the strongest possible terms' - but did not lay the blame on President Donald Trump for inciting the MAGA mob An explosion caused by a police munition is seen while Trump supporters gather in front of the Capitol on Wednesday Protesters broke windows to gain access to the Capitol as lawmakers were whisked to safety on Wednesday afternoon The protests escalated into violence as Trump supporters clashed with police on the grounds of the Capitol 'To those who wreaked havoc in our capitol today, you did not win,' Pence said. 'Violence never wins. Freedom wins. And this is still the people's house.' The vice president, who is chairing the special Senate session, called it a 'dark day in the history of the United States Capitol.' 'But thanks to the swift efforts of the U.S. Capitol Police, federal, state and local law enforcement, the violence was quelled. The Capitol is secured and the people's work continues,' Pence said. But astonishingly – and to the disgust of Republicans including Mitt Romney and every Democrat – some Republicans continued their doomed bid to overturn the election result. The most senior was House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, who claimed that persisting was proof that Congress was not cowed by violence. And Josh Hawley, the Missouri senator who gave a clenched fist salute to the mob before it stormed the Capitol, also refused to back down even as other senators who had planned to object abandoned the campaign. 'Americans go to bed tonight their lasting memory should not be a congress overrun by rioters. It must be a resolute Congress, conducting healthy debate,' McCarthy said. 'We may not disagree on a lot in America but tonight, we must show the world that we will respectfully, but thoroughly carry out the most basic duties of democracy, we will continue with the task that we have been sent here to do. We will follow the Constitution and the law and the process for hearing valid concerns about election integrity. We'll do it with respect.' Sen. Josh Hawley, who was the first senator who pledged to back a House GOP effort to object to certain states' Electoral College vote counts, refused to abandon the effort entirely House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy claimed that persisting was proof that Congress was not cowed by violence Sen Ted Cruz looks on as the certification proceedings continue despite objections by him and other Republicans Sen. Hawley, who was the first senator who pledged to back a House GOP effort to object to certain states' Electoral College vote counts, refused to abandon the effort entirely. The Missouri Republican argued that the Senate floor was the appropriate place to address any election fraud concerns - as opposed to a violent riot. 'Violence is not how you achieve change,' Hawley said. 'And that's why I submit to my colleagues that what we're doing here tonight is actually very important. Because of those who have concerns about the integrity of our elections ... this is the appropriate means, this is the lawful place, where those objections and concerns should be heard.' Directly after Hawley spoke, Sen. Mitt Romney applauded those senators, like Loeffler and Lankford, who had abandoned Hawley and the 'dirty dozen's' effort He said he hoped the Senate could address concerns 'peacefully, without violence, without attacks, without bullets.' Hawley then indicated that he might not file objections after the debate over Arizona was complete, bringing up the issues he had with Pennsylvania during his brief floor speech. 'And so Mr. President let me just say now, that briefly, in lieu of speaking about it later, a word about Pennsylvania - this is a state that I have been focused on, objected to,' Hawley said. He then went on to complain that the state set-up 'universal mail-in balloting.' 'And did it irregardless of what the Pennsylvania Constitution says,' Hawley said, using the improper word for regardless. The senator then objected to how the Pennsylvania Supreme Court made its decision, holding up the law that allowed for enhanced mail-in voting during the coronavirus pandemic. Directly after Hawley spoke, Sen. Mitt Romney applauded those senators, like Loeffler and Lankford, who had abandoned Hawley and the 'dirty dozen's' effort. 'The best way we can show respect to the voters who are upset is by telling them the truth,' Romney implored. And the truth, he said, was 'President-Elect Biden won the election. President Trump lost.' 'I've had that experience myself, it's no fun,' Romney said, a reference to losing the 2012 presidential election to Democratic President Barack Obama. As he concluded, Romney was given a standing ovation by some senators – but not by Hawley, who was sitting directly in front of him. McConnell, who earlier chastised members of his own party who planned to file objections to the Electoral College vote count, proclaimed, 'The United States Senate will not be intimidated.' Pence's condemnation was followed by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, with Schumer - a New York Democrat - placing the blame squarely on Trump Pro-Trump supporters storm the U.S. Capitol following a rally with President Donald Trump on January 6 As 2 am neared, Rep Conor Lamb, a Pennsylvania Democrat who represents the Pittsburgh area, unloaded on the Republicans who objected to the vote from his state. Lamb first read from the speech he had planned to give pre-riot, including that Allegheny County's vote-counting operation had '31 video cameras!' he said, raising his voice. 'These objections don't deserve an ounce of respect. Not an ounce,' he then said. 'A woman died out there tonight and you're making these objections,' Lamb went on. 'Let's be clear about what happened in this chamber today: invaders came in for the first time since the War of 1812.' Lamb nodded over in the direction of a group of his Republican colleagues. 'We know that that attack today, it didn't materialize out of nowhere. It was inspired by lies, the same lies you're hearing in this room tonight, and the members who are repeating those lies should be ashamed of themselves,' Lamb said. 'Their constituents should be ashamed of them.' Rep. Morgan Griffith shouted to have Lamb's comments struck from the record. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi gaveled his request down, later explaining that he wasn't quick enough, saying it needed to happen 'exactly when the words are spoken.' Nearby, a scuffle among lawmakers nearly broke out involving Rep. Andy Harris, a Maryland Republican, and Rep. Colin Allred, a Texas Democrat, according to Capitol Hill reporters. Allred is a former professional football player. As 2 am neared, Rep Conor Lamb (pictured), a Pennsylvania Democrat who represents the Pittsburgh area, unloaded on the Republicans who objected to the vote from his state Speaker Nancy Pelosi reopened the House of Representatives Wednesday night with a vow to stay as long as it takes to certify the election and Joe Biden's victory. 'Congress has returned to the Capitol,' she said seven hours after the chamber was closed because rioters were trying to breach its doors. 'We always knew that this responsibility would take us into the night, and will stay as long as it takes. Our purpose will be accomplished. We must and we will show to the country.' 'We know that we're in difficult times, but little could we have imagined the assault, that was made on our democracy,' she said in reference to the pro-Trump insurgents who tried to stop the Joint Session. She said it was the duty of lawmakers to show the world 'the peaceful transfer of power from one president to the next.' Shortly before all House members were evacuated around 2.30pm, Capitol Police approached Pelosi, who was presiding over the chamber from the speaker's rostrum, telling her she had to leave. Pelosi didn't make a fuss and turned over her duties to House Rules Chairman Jim McGovern. He told reporters on Capitol Hill that she whispered 'thank you' and handed him the gavel as she was led away. Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., presides over the House Chamber after they reconvened House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy will stand by President Trump and continue his party's objections to the certification of states won by Joe Biden in the electoral college. Some Republican senators backed down from the original plan to object after pro-Trump insurgents rushed the Capitol. But McCarthy said it was lawmakers' duty to conduct 'healthy debate' and to hear 'valid concerns about election integrity.' WHO'S STILL IN TRUMP'S CAMP? Josh Hawley Kevin McCarthy Ted Cruz Matt Gaetz Louie Gohmert Paul Gosar Jim Jordan Ronny Jackson Tommy Tuberville Marjorie Taylor Greene Advertisement 'When Americans go to bed tonight their lasting memory should not be a Congress overrun by rioters. It must be a resolute Congress, conducting healthy debate. We may not disagree on a lot in America but tonight, we must show the world that we will respectfully, but thoroughly carry out the most basic duties of democracy, we will continue with the task that we have been sent here to do. We will follow the Constitution and the law and the process for hearing valid concerns about election integrity. We'll do it with respect,' he said on the House floor after the chamber reopened. But he also condemned the rioters. 'We saw the worst of America this afternoon,' he said. McCarthy also warned lawmakers to think twice about what they post on social media. Posts by Republicans, including President Trump, falsely stating the election was rigged and fraudulent were believed to have contributed to inciting the mob that ran sacked the Capitol. 'We also should think for a moment about what do we put on social media,' he said. 'Just because you have a personal opinion different than mine, you have a right to say it, but nobody has a right to become a mob. And we all should stand united to condemning them all together.' Pence's condemnation was followed by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, with Schumer - a New York Democrat - placing the blame squarely on Trump. 'Today's events would certainly not have happened without him,' Schumer said. McConnell, who earlier chastised members of his own party who planned to file objections to the Electoral College vote count, proclaimed, 'The United States Senate will not be intimidated.' 'Will not be kept out of its chamber by thugs, mobs or threats. We will not bend for lawlessness or intimidation,' the Kentucky Republican said. He said senators would discharge their Constitutional duty - to certify the results of the presidential race. 'And we're going to do it tonight,' McConnell said. The Kentucky Republican proclaimed, 'Criminal behavior will never dominate the United States Congress.' Schumer followed, admitting that he didn't quite have the words to describe what happened Wednesday on Capitol Hill. 'I have never lived through, or even imagined the experience like the one we have just witnessed in this Capitol,' he said. 'This temple to democracy was desecrated, its windows smashed, our offices vandalized.' A protester sits in the Senate Chamber.

'We mourn her and feel for her friends and family,' Schumer said. 'This will be a stain on our country not so easily washed away,' he added. And the soon-to-be majority leader, after Democrats were successful in both Georgia Senate run-off races, pointed a finger at Trump, calling the day's events the 'final terrible indelible legacy of the 45th president of the United States.' 'Undoubtedly our worst,' Schumer argued. 'Today's events did not happen spontaneously, the president who promoted conspiracy theories, who motivated these thugs, a president who exhorted them to come to our United States capitol, egged them on, who hardly ever discourages violence. This president deals a great deal of the blame,' Schumer said. He said that those responsible for overtaking the capitol could not be called 'protesters.' 'These were rioters and insurrectionist goons and thugs, domestic terrorists,' Schumer said. 'They do not represent America Senate Majority Leader spoke immediately after Pence to declare that the chamber would not be intimidated by 'thugs.' McConnell found himself denouncing Trump's bid to overturn the election for the second time in a day, after earlier delivering a strong speech blasting the effort by members of his own caucus seeking to throw out electors in states that went for Joe Biden. Wednesday night, after Trump supporters breached hallways that McConnell has walked for decades on 'unhinged' invaders – without mentioning that it was President Trump who encouraged his supporters to march to the Capitol. Nevertheless, he eviscerated the Trump backers who ran wild inside the chamber. 'The United States Senate will not be intimidated. We will not be kept out of this chamber by thugs, mobs or threats. We will not bow to lawlessness or intimidation,' vowed McConnell. 'We are back at our post. We will discharge our duty under the Constitution and for our nation. And we're going to do it tonight,' said McConnell. The Kentucky Republican proclaimed, 'Criminal behavior will never dominate the United States Congress.' Schumer followed, admitting that he didn't quite have the words to describe what happened Wednesday on Capitol Hill Sen. Lindsey Graham, one of the president's top allies in the Senate, threw water on the objectors' efforts recalling how in 1876 three southern states - South Carolina, Louisiana and Florida - sent two slates of electors to Congress, in a bid to end Reconstruction after the Civil War His words were both strengthened and undercut by his close association with Trump's tenure: McConnell's wife Elaine Chao serves as Trump's Transportation secretary. McConnell spent weeks without denouncing Trump's unsubstantiated claims the election was rigged. And it was in partnership with Trump that he achieved his life's goal of stacking the judiciary with conservative jurists. He spoke with contempt towards the mob who invaded the Capitol, saying the country had 'faced down much greater threats than the unhinged crowd we saw today.' Among Republicans bailing on the plan to contest the results was Sen. James Lankford of Oklahoma, known as an institutionalist before he signed onto the effort by Sen. Ted Cruz 'We've never been deterred before and we'll be not deterred today. They tried to disrupt our democracy. They failed,' he intoned. He called it a 'failed insurrection' and said it 'only underscores how crucial the task before us is for our republic.' 'Now we're going to finish exactly what we started,' said McConnell. 'We'll complete the process in the right way: by the book.' He said the Senate would follow its precedents and laws and Constitution 'to the letter.' 'And we will certify the winner of the 2020 presidential election,' he said forcefully. 'Criminal behavior will never dominate the United States Congress. This institution is resilient. Our democratic republic is strong. The American people deserve nothing less,' he said. Among Republicans bailing on the plan to contest the results was Sen. James Lankford of Oklahoma, known as an institutionalist before he signed onto the effort by Sen. Ted Cruz. 'Why in god's name would someone think attacking law enforcement occupying United States Capitol is the best way to show that you're right? Why would you do that?' he asked. 'Rioters and thugs don't run the capitol we're the United States of America. We disagree on a lot of things and we have a lot of spirited debate in this room. But we talk it out and we honor each other. Lankford had been on the Senate floor defending the opposition to votes in states Biden won when officials evacuated the chamber and locked down the Capitol. 'I was literally interrupted mid-sentence speaking here. Because we're all aware of what was happening right outside this room,' he said, praising law enforcement who protected the Capitol. Georgia Republican Sen. Kelly Loeffler, who lost her race in the early hours Wednesday to Democratic Rev. Raphael Warnock, announced that she would no longer be filing objections to Electoral College votes He quickly bowed to the new reality. 'Obviously the commission that we've asked for is not going to happen at this point and I understand that and we're headed towards tonight towards the certification of Joe Biden to be the president of the United States,' he said. Cruz and his compatriots wanted a special commission to investigate electoral fraud claims tossed out of courts over a ten-day period. 'And we will work together in this body to be able to send peaceful example in the days ahead,' he concluded. Sen. Lindsey Graham, one of the president's top allies in the Senate, threw water on the objectors' efforts recalling how in 1876 three southern states - South Carolina, Louisiana and Florida - sent two slates of electors to Congress, in a bid to end Reconstruction after the Civil War. 'It led to Jim Crow,' Graham said. 'If you're looking for historical guidance, this is not the one to pick.' The South Carolina Republican also said that a forming a commission to look into fraud wouldn't change minds. 'Having a commission chosen by Nancy Pelosi, Mitch McConnell and John Roberts is not going to get you to where you want to go, it ain't going to work,' Graham said. 'It's not going to do any good, it's going to delay and it gives credibility to a dark chapter of our history.' Graham maintained Trump was a 'consequential president.' 'But today ... all I can say is count me out, enough is enough, I've tried to be helpful.' Graham praised Pence, telling him: 'what they're asking you to do, you won't do, because you can't.' Trump has pressured Pence to choose between Electoral College votes and 'alternate' slates of electors, which the vice president doesn't have the power to do. Graham also mentioned how he had traveled the world with Biden, when they served together in the Senate. 'I prayed he would lose,' Graham said. 'He's the legitimate president of the United States.' Georgia Republican Sen. Kelly Loeffler, who lost her race in the early hours Wednesday to Democratic Rev. Raphael Warnock, announced that she would no longer be filing objections to Electoral College votes. 'When I arrived in Washington this morning, I fully intended to object to the certification of the electoral votes,' she said. 'However, the events that have transpired today have forced me to reconsider and I cannot now, in good conscience, object.' Sen. Steve Daines, a Montana Republican, also announced that he no longer supported senators filing objections. The newly minted Sen. Roger Marshall, a Kansas Republican, who had joined Sen. Ted Cruz's 'dirty dozen,' seemed to still back the effort in his debut floor speech. 'We must restore faith and confidence in one of our republic's most hallowed and patriotic duties: voting,' Marshall said. Marshall said he backed the creation of an electoral commission to give states to constructive suggestions' going forward, due to the 'jarring irregularities' he claimed took place in the 2020 race. It's unclear if Marshall would back additional challenges in states going forward, as the Senate's discussion was only focused on Electoral College votes in Arizona. A woman was shot in the chest on Wednesday afternoon after chaotic scenes broke out when dozens of Trump supporters breached security perimeters at the Capitol. She died at a hospital hours later, law enforcement sources said Police spray tear gas at a protester who picked up a police barricade in an effort to get closer to the Capitol Members of congress run for cover as protesters try to enter the House Chamber A protester walks through Congress carrying Nancy Pelosi's lectern after storming the Capitol Republican Congressman Thomas Reed announced he is against the GOP objections to the certification, earning a round of applause from Democrats. Reed walked to the Democratic side of the House to speak about his opposition, citing the day's violence in the Capitol as the reason. 'We settle our differences through elections,' he said, denouncing the 'mob rule' that took place earlier in the afternoon. 'What we see tonight in this body shall be what we do in America. And that is to transfer power in a peaceful way,' he said as Democrats gave him a standing ovation. Republican Congressman Matt Gaetz, a top Trump ally on Capitol Hill, pushed a conspiracy theory that some of the mob that raided the Capitol were members of Antifa, who are opposed to fascism and other forms of extreme right-wing ideology. President Trump has tried to label Antifa as a terrorist group but they a political philosophy. There is no evidence they were involved in Wednesday's insurrection. Gaetz cited the conservative newspaper The Washington Times when he spoke on the House floor to defend Republican objections to the electoral college votes in some states won by Biden. 'The Washington Times has just reported, some pretty compelling evidence from a facial recognition company, showing that some of the people who breached the Capitol today, were not Trump supporters, they were masquerading as Trump supporters, and in fact, we're members of the violet terrorist group Antifa,' he said as Democrats loudly booed him. Gaetz, a frequent guest at Trump's Florida residence Mar-a-Lago, also defended the president, who was criticized by many, including members of the Republican Party, for his lackluster response to the riots. 'Another important point for the country is that this morning President Trump explicitly called for demonstrations and protests to be peaceful,' Gaetz said. Trump, in tweets, did say the protesters should be peaceful but he didn't call for them to stand down and leave the Capitol. Democrats booed Gaetz as he spoke, which he acknowledged: 'You can moan and groan but he was far more explicit about his calls for peace than some of the BLM and left wing writers were this summer, when we saw violence sweep across this nation.' Gaetz also got in a dig at liberal Democrats, who have called to defund the police. 'I'm sure glad that at least for one day, I didn't hear my Democratic colleagues calling to defund the police,' he said as his Republican colleagues cheered. Members of Congress are pictured rushing to evacuate the House Chamber as protesters attempted to enter National Guard members line up on the Capitol grounds as protesters continue occupying the area after curfew The mostly maskless crowd flooded the halls of the Capitol with little resistance from Capitol Police The DC National Guard was deployed to the streets to help enforce a 6pm curfew Trump - after remaining silent for much of the afternoon - posted a video telling his 'very special' supporters inside the Capitol that he loves them and understands their pain but urged them 'to go home'. He had initially encouraged his supporters to march to the Capitol after a rally earlier in the afternoon before asking them only to remain peaceful when violence broke out. The Capitol was briefly secured before being placed on lockdown again at around 6.45pm due to an 'internal security threat' after an officer was reportedly found unconscious. Anyone inside a building at the Capitol complex was instructed to take cover in an office with doors locked. But just before 8pm lawmakers who had been whisked to safety when the siege kicked off began arriving back at the Capitol to resume the Joint Session to certify the Electoral College count of the presidential election. The lawmakers were seen flanked by armed guards as they made their way into the Capitol. A spokesperson for Vice President Mike Pence, who is residing over the Joint Session, said he was already in the building because he'd never left. As the protesters broke down police barricades and stormed into the Capitol, lawmakers cowering inside the House Chamber were told to put on gas masks as tear gas was fired in the Rotunda. Officers at the front door of the chamber had their guns drawn at a protester trying to break down the door. The Capitol was placed on lockdown again at around 6.45pm due to an 'internal security threat' after an officers was reportedly found unconscious. Anyone inside a building at the Capitol complex was instructed to take cover in an office with doors locked For those fleeing, it was a race against time: Protesters were getting in as quickly as members of Congress could get out. One protester occupied the Senate dais and yelled: 'Trump won that election'. Some protesters even occupied Pelosi's office, sitting mockingly at a desk. The chaotic scenes unfolded soon after Trump addressed thousands of his supporters and urged them to march to the Capitol. The protesters organized via far-right social media sites, including Gab and Parler, telling each other the best routes to avoid police on their way to the Capitol. After protesters started clashing with law enforcement, Trump tweeted to his supporters to 'stay peaceful'. 'Please support our Capitol Police and Law Enforcement. They are truly on the side of our Country. Stay peaceful!' the president wrote. As the violence escalated, Trump tweeted: 'I am asking for everyone at the U.S. Capitol to remain peaceful. No violence! Remember, WE are the Party of Law & Order - respect the Law and our great men and women in Blue. Thank you!' He did not initially tell the protesters to leave. Biden on Wednesday evening called for the restoration of 'simple decency' after the mob delayed Congress from certifying the results of November's election. 'At this hour, our democracy is under unprecedented assault unlike anything we've seen in modern times,' Biden said. He called it 'an assault on the rule of law like few times we have ever seen it.' 'I call on this mob to pull back and allow democracy to go forward. In an address that took less than 10 minutes and was televised against a split screen of the still-occupied Capitol building, Biden attempted to project calm and to say that a deeply divided country can still come together - while also expressing outrage. He stopped short of accusing Trump of treason but said the events 'bordered on sedition'. 'At their best, the words of a president can inspire,' Biden added. 'At their worst they can incite.' Minutes after Biden's address, Trump posted his own video telling his mob of supporters that he 'loves' them, but to 'go home'. In the same breath he also continued to peddle his baseless claims that the 'election was stolen'. 'There's never been a time like this where such a thing happened where they could take it away from all of us - from me, from you, from our country. This was a fraudulent election, but we can't play into the hands of these people,' he said. 'We have to have peace. So, go home. We love you. You're very special. You've seen what happens. You see the way others are treated that are so bad and so evil. I know how you feel. But go home and go home in peace.' The video was later removed by Facebook, Twitter and YouTube because it violated their policies. The president then posted another tweet reiterating his false claim that the election was stolen and encouraging supporters to 'remember this day'. The tweet was perceived by some as an attempt to rile up the Capitol crowds. 'These are the things and events that happen when a sacred landslide election victory is so unceremoniously & viciously stripped away from great patriots who have been badly & unfairly treated for so long,' he tweeted. 'Go home with love & in peace. Remember this day forever!' Twitter removed the tweet for violating its rules. Mob smashes through police barriers and wall of tear gas to stop Biden's victory being certified: How Trump protesters turned Congress into a battlefield Capitol Police used tear gas as hundreds of people were seen climbing the marble steps outside the building. They banged on the locked doors of the Capitol and smashed the glass in the doors. Demonstrators fought with police and then forced their way into the building. Asked how so many people were able to get in, officials said they were focusing their attention on keeping lawmakers inside safe. 'We love you. You are special.' Trump finally addresses Capitol mob HE unleashed and says 'Go home now. We have to have peace' Donald Trump told his mob of supporters that he 'loves' them, but to 'go home' after they rampaged past police barriers to storm the U.S. Capitol. But despite calling for his supporters to stand down, he continued to peddle the baseless claims that the 'election was stolen' in a video posted to Twitter Wednesday afternoon. 'There's never been a time like this where such a thing happened where they could take it away from all of us - from me, from you, from our country. This was a fraudulent election, but we can't play into the hands of these people. 'We have to have peace. So, go home. We love you. You're very special. You've seen what happens. You see the way others are treated that are so bad and so evil. I know how you feel. But go home and go home in peace,' Trump said. It came hours after Trump stirred them into a frenzy at his 'Stop the Steal' rally, telling them to march on the U.S. Capitol. The president still has not conceded the election and earlier Wednesday addressed a crowd at the ellipse spouting conspiracy theories that he still had a path to win - if Vice President Mike Pence did his bidding, as well as if GOP lawmakers revolted. Pence did no such thing. The chaotic scenes unfolded soon after Trump addressed thousands of protesters and urged his supporters to march to the Capitol. After protesters started clashing with law enforcement following the Capitol breach, Trump tweeted to his supporters to 'stay peaceful' Advertisement One video posted on TikTok appeared to show a group of about four officers standing by as protesters pushed past a barricade near the Capitol building. The officers did not appear to try to block the stampede, instead walking with it toward the building. One protester jumped up on the dais, where the president of the Senate presides, and yelled: 'Trump won that election.' Several dozen protesters roamed the halls of the Capitol, yelling: 'Where are they?' Tear gas was being used by Capitol Police as protesters filled both the House and Senate side of the Capitol. Another protester in the Senate yelled: 'Where's Pence, show yourself!' The chaos caused the Capitol to go on lockdown and disrupted the certification of the electoral college vote that would cement Biden's victory. Mayor Bowser declared a 6pm curfew for the city and said multiple law enforcement agencies would be patrolling the streets. Just before the curfew went into effect she was asked multiple by times by CNN if curfew violators would be arrested, but she refused to give a clear answer. Bowser said 'many' arrests had already been made but did not have a specific number. As footage started coming out of Capitol Hill being breached by angry Trump supporters, Donald Trump Jr tried to quell the outburst with a tweet – that was critical of Democrats and liberals. 'This is wrong and not who we are. Be peaceful and use your 1st Amendment rights, but don't start acting like the other side,' Trump Jr. wrote. 'We have a country to save and this doesn't help anyone.' Meanwhile, the president continued to direct his rage at Pence, who earlier announced he would not single-handedly overturn the election results from his position of the chair. 'Mike Pence didn't have the courage to do what should have been done to protect our Country and our Constitution, giving States a chance to certify a corrected set of facts, not the fraudulent or inaccurate ones which they were asked to previously certify. USA demands the truth!' the president tweeted. The extraordinary breech was a departure from security mishaps of the past. Protesters have routinely disrupted televised hearings while in progress and even events inside the House chamber. But trained Capitol Police are usually able to arrest disruptors and remove them immediately. Often formal charges are never filed. But in Wednesday's storming of the building, dozens of people made it by armed police officers and entered the building without going through any security set up to keep out those with weapons or dangerous items. There were occasions after September 11th when the building was placed on lockdown and people were ordered to leave, but this usually happened when suspicious packages were discovered. When the building is open, as it was before the pandemic, members of the general public are not allowed to walk unescorted on the second floor where lawmakers enter and exit the legislative chambers. The protesters were aided by scaffolding constructed for the upcoming inauguration. In another tense piece of video from inside, Rep. Michael McCaul (R-Texas) tweeted video of protesters repeatedly rushing Capitol Police officers in the crypt, in the ground floor part of the building under the rotunda. 'I like many people voted for President Trump in the 2020 election and hoped for a different result,' McCaul wrote. 'But violence and destruction is not the way to express your grievances. This is disgraceful and has to end.'

Protesters swarmed into the Kansas statehouse in Topeka and gathered inside the first floor of the Capitol Rotunda, though the rally remained orderly, television station KSNT reported. There were no immediate reports of violence, despite the flurry of demonstrations by pro-Trump demonstrators echoing his baseless claims that he was robbed of a re-election victory due to voter fraud. Denver Mayor Michael Hancock said on Twitter that he had instructed city agencies to close municipal offices early in Colorado's state capital 'out of an abundance of caution' after about 700 demonstrators gathered at the statehouse downtown. 'My hope is that this situation will be resolved quickly. Pray for our nation,' he tweeted. A major courthouse complex and two other government buildings in Atlanta, the capital of Georgia, were also ordered closed due to protests near the statehouse. Among those whose daily routines were altered were aides to Georgia's secretary of state, Brad Raffensperger, the Republican election official pressured by Trump in a weekend telephone call to 'find' enough additional votes for the president to overturn the November victory of President-elect Joe Biden, due to take office in two weeks. Raffensperger's spokesman, Walter Jones, said staff left their offices after lunch out of an abundance of caution because of protests. He said Raffensperger was not in the office at the time. In Salt Lake City, Dana Jones, director of the state Capitol Preservation Board, said she had asked building staff to work from home on Wednesday afternoon on the advice of the Utah Highway Patrol and public safety commissioner, according to the Salt Lake Tribune. The precaution was taken, the newspaper said, in response to a crowd of about 250 pro-Trump demonstrators who posted signs on the Capitol building that read: 'Stop the steal!' and 'Trump won!' A Utah state police spokesman said security had been beefed up at the Capitol, though he said protesters there were 'very peaceful,' the Tribune reported. It said one of its photographers was pepper-sprayed by individuals upset that he was documenting their protest. Several hundred Trump supporters also staged a 'Stop the Steal' rally at the Arizona state Capitol in Phoenix, cheering and jeering while exhibiting a guillotine.

He threatened Pence saying 'I'm not hearing good stories' and telling him to have 'courage' to strike down swing states' votes – a move which would defy the constitution. But minutes before arriving on Capitol Hill to preside over the joint session of Congress to certify the election's outcome, Pence bluntly told lawmakers that he would refuse to obey Trump's orders. Pence sent a letter to the 535 senators and representatives on Capitol Hill ahead of his presiding over the Joint Session that will certify Joe Biden's victory. In it, he outlined his belief in his role in the proceedings, which he notes is 'ceremonial' and adds that it doesn't include the authority to 'determine which electoral votes should be counted and which should not.' Trump has tried to put the blame on Pence for his expected loss on Wednesday but the president also lacks support among the majority of senators in his own party, which dooms his efforts for a congressional overthrow of the results. Pence acknowledged Trump's allegations the election was rigged, of which there has been no proof and no court has upheld, in a likely peace offering to the president. 'I share the concerns of millions of Americans about the integrity of this election,' he wrote. Images emerged shortly before of hundreds of protesters descending on the steps of the Capitol after rallying near the White House for President Donald Trump A Capitol Police officer urged lawmakers to leave the building after top leaders were escorted out Pence acknowledged Trump's allegations the election was rigged, which there has been no proof and no court has upheld, in a likely peace offering to the president Members of the far-right group Proud Boys make 'OK' hand gestures indicating 'white power' during the chaos Leigh Ann Luck dressed up as Statue of Liberty shouts as supporters of U.S. President Donald Trump protest Tear gas was being used by Capitol Police as protesters filled both the House and Senate side of the Capitol Capitol Police spray tear gas at Trump supporters as they try to break through a police barrier In a letter Wednesday, Pence said, 'It is my considered judgment that my oath to support and defend the Constitution contains me from claiming unilateral authority to determine which electoral votes should be counted and which should not' But he noted as vice president he does not have the power from the constitution to decide which electoral votes are counted and which are not. 'As a student of history who loves the constitution and reveres its Framers, I do not believe that the Founds of our country intended to invest the vice president with unilateral authority to decide which electoral votes should be counted during the Joint Session of Congress and no Vice President in American history has ever asserted such authority,' Pence noted. He added vice presidents in the past have conducted 'the proceedings in an orderly manner even where the count resulted in the defeat of their party or their own candidacy'. 'It is my considered judgement that my oath to support and defend the Constitution constrains me from claiming unilateral authority to determine which electoral votes should be counted and which should not,' he said. He concluded his letter with a prayer to God: 'When the Joint Session of Congress convenes today, I will do my duty to see to it that we open the certificates of electors of the several states, we hear objections raised by Senators and Representatives, and we count the votes of the Electoral College for President and Vice President in a manner consistent with our Constitution, laws and history. So Help Me God.' Pelosi reminded lawmakers that only 11 members from each party were allowed on the House floor at a time due to social distancing. She called out Republicans for having too many lawmakers on the floor 'The law says voter registration ends on October 5. Democrats said we don't care what the law says they went to a court got an Obama appointed judge to extend in 18 days,' Republican Congressman Jim Jordan, a top Trump ally on Capitol Hill, complained of Arizona Speaker Nancy Pelosi presided over the debate. She sanitized the gavel before she used it. Pence had used it when he presided over the Joint Session REPUBLICANS OBJECT TO ARIZONA'S VOTES When the certification process got underway shortly after 1pm Wednesday, lawmakers got through Alabama and Alaska, two states that went for Trump, before the first objection was filed for Arizona. Rep. Paul Gosar, an Arizona Republican, objected to his state's Electoral College votes going to Biden and Harris. He confirmed that his objection had been signed on to by a US senator. Democrats in the chamber audibly groaned while droves of Republicans in the chamber stood up and clapped. The move forced Pence to order the houses out of Joint Session. The senators in the House chamber started moving back toward their side of the US Capitol. On the House side, during their debate on the Arizona objection, Republican lawmakers used their time to complain about the treatment of the president, particularly the impeachment process and special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation. They did not offer any proof of voter fraud but complained that voter laws were changed ahead of the November contest, which is not illegal. 'The law says voter registration ends on October 5. Democrats said we don't care what the law says they went to a court got an Obama appointed judge to extend in 18 days,' Republican Congressman Jim Jordan, a top Trump ally on Capitol Hill, complained of Arizona. Many states had their voter registration deadlines extended because of the coronavirus pandemic – the extension applied to voters of both parties. Other states extended the time period allowing mail-in voting, again because of the pandemic and it applied to all voters. Democrats argued the election was legally conducted. 'Under some of the most trying circumstances in our history, our fellow citizens conducted a free and fair election vindicating our founders belief once again that we were capable of self government, and a peaceful transition of power,' Democratic Congressman Adam Schiff said. Speaker Pelosi presided over the debate. She sanitized the gavel before she used it. Pence had used it when he presided over the Joint Session. Pelosi also reminded lawmakers that only 11 members from each party were allowed on the House floor at a time due to social distancing. She called out Republicans for having too many lawmakers on the floor. MITCH MCCONNELL SLAMS ELECTION 'CONSPIRACY THEORIES' Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell shamed Trump and his own Republican colleagues for mounting challenges to the Electoral College vote count, saying their doing so could lead to a 'death spiral' of American democracy – and pointing out there's no real evidence of widespread voter fraud. 'We're debating a step that has never been taken in American history, whether Congress should overrule the voters and overturn a presidential election,' he said on the Senate floor, after Rep Gosar and a batch of GOP senators, including Sen Ted Cruz, objected to Arizona's Electoral College vote count. McConnell ridiculed Trump's claims of widespread voter fraud in a five-minute speech, which will be one of his last as majority leader, and which he said was about the most important vote of his career. 'The assertions range from specific, local allegations to Constitutional arguments to sweeping conspiracy theories,' McConnell said. He reminded senators that he was supportive of Trump using the country's legal system, which handed the president and his team loss after loss. And pointed out that these cases were heard by some of the 'all-star judges whom the president himself nominated' - including on the U.S. Supreme Court. McConnell said that every election is plagued by some instances of vote irregularity. 'And of course that's unacceptable,' he said. McConnell ridiculed President Donald Trump's claims of widespread voter fraud in a five-minute speech which will be one of his last as majority leader – and which he said was about the most important vote of his career The top Senate Republican also said he supported 'strong state-led voting reforms,' adding that he didn't wan tto see 'last year's bizarre pandemic procedures' - like mail-in ballots that gave Democrats an edge - 'become the new norm.' 'But my colleagues nothing before us proves illegality anywhere near the massive scale, the massive scale that would have tipped the entire election,' McConnell argued. 'Nor can public doubt alone justify a radical break, when the doubt itself was incited without any evidence.' He pointed out that the Constitution gives Congress a 'limited role.' 'We simply can't declare ourselves a national board of elections on steroids,' McConnell said. Twisting the knife into Trump, McConnell also pointed out that the race between Biden and Trump 'was not unusually close.' 'The Electoral College margin was almost identical to what it was in 2016,' McConnell pointed out. 'If this election were overturned by mere allegations from the losing side our democracy would enter a death spiral,' McConnell warned. 'We'd never see a whole nation accept an election again.' 'Every four years there would be a scramble for power at any cost,' he added. TRUMP'S STOP THE STEAL RALLY This came after Trump excoriated 'weak' Republicans and demanded fealty from Pence to a rally crowd near the White House on Wednesday, where he demanded Pence and Congress overturn the election results that lead to his defeat. In an extraordinary speech, Trump once again called his election 'rigged' just minutes before a joint meeting of Congress was to begin counting the certified electoral votes that have him losing to Joe Biden. Trump referred to votes that came in after 10pm election night – which consisted of in-person and mail-in ballots and denied him the lead he said he and his pollsters anticipated – as 'these explosions of bullsh*t.' Members of the crowd immediately chanted 'Bullshi*t!' in response. 'Our election was over at 10 in the evening,' Trump said. Trump mocked his party's 2012 Republican presidential nominee, now-Sen. Mitt Romney, for conceded his own race back then. 'We will never concede. It doesn't happen,' he said – although losing candidates have conceded for generations. 'There's never been anything like this. It's a pure theft.' Trump's comments amounted to a declaration of war on elements of his party, after his lawyer Rudy Giuliani demanded 'trial by combat' against opponents of his claims of election fraud. Trump spoke to a crowd of several thousand – but referred to them as consisting of 'hundreds of thousands' of supporters fathered on a lawn south of the White House that doesn't hold that many. He said his election was 'stolen by the fake news media. That's what they've done and that's what they're doing.' Trump addressed his thousands of his supporters near the White House Wednesday at his 'Save America' rally and declared war on his own party, calling Republicans who opposed him 'weak' Hours after a humiliating defeat in one Georgia Senate race and the prospect of losing another, Team Trump showed no sign of conceding A stand was being erected at the base of the US Capitol as a pro-Trump supporter holds a flag, hours before Congress meets to certify the electoral college vote for Biden A crowd of Trump supporters started gathering outside of the White House for a rally on Wednesday He urged his supporters to march down to the Congress, which was to commence the count at 1 pm. 'We're going to walk down to the Capitol and we're going to cheer on our brave senators and congressmen and women,' he said, speaking from behind a pane of bullet-proof material. He turned up the heat on Pence, a potential 2024 contender who will preside over the count. His role is set in the Constitution and the Electoral Count Act, and is largely ceremonial. 'Mike Pence is going to have to come through for us, and if he doesn't that will be a sad day for our country because you're sworn to uphold our Constitution,' he said. Trump acknowledged that he has tried to pressure Pence into rejecting votes from states he lost, quoting from a conversation he has denied happened. 'All Vice President Pence has to do is send it back to the states to re-certify and we become president and you are the happiest people,' he told his fans, who cheered 'Stop the Steal!' at times. 'I said Mike, that doesn't take courage. What takes courage is to do nothing. That takes courage. And then we're stuck with a president who lost the election by a lot and we have to live with that,' he said of Biden."", ""House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Democratic leaders formally accused Donald Trump of incitement to insurrection Monday morning as part of an attempt to shame him out of office at breakneck speed. Democrats introduced their impeachment resolution, first floated Friday, accusing Trump of 'incitement of insurrection' as the House met and later announced there would be a vote on it on Wednesday starting at 9a.m. Top Democrats say it has enough support to pass the House - and that they expect Republicans to sign on to it. And they set up fast-moving floor votes that that will force House Republicans to cast votes this week both on President Trump's fitness for office and on whether to remove him during his final days in power. On Monday morning, House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer (D-Md.) sought to call up a resolution that would instruct Pence to convene cabinet members to declare Trump 'incapable of executing the duties of his office' under the terms of the 25th Amendment. But he failed to get 'unanimous consent' when a House Republican objected. Pelosi says she will respond by bringing the 25th amendment resolution to the floor Tuesday - meaning Republicans will have to vote on the record on whether they believe Trump is fit for office. That vote will be later on Tuesday with members ordered back to D.C. in a message from Democratic leadership which said the impeachment vote would take place Wednesday. Given that a majority of the House have already signed on, with at least 218 having backed the motion Monday, Trump will become on Wednesday the first president to be impeached twice, unless he leaves officer before then. The moves came on a day when: Melania Trump issued a statement condemning the violence of last week but naming the dead rioters before the dead police then lashing out at 'salacious gossip' about her, an apparent reference to the revelation she continued with a photoshoot while the Capitol was desecrated; Trump tried to give an impression of business as usual, giving a Medal of Freedom at the White House to Jim Jordan, the 'freedom caucus' Republican House member who was all-in on overturning the election results; The FBI warned of armed protests being planned in all 50 states between now and Joe Biden taking office; More MAGA rioters were swept up by police around the country, but questions mounted over the police failures which let them storm the Capitol; 10,000 National Guard were ordered to be in Washington D.C. for Biden's inauguration in a sign of how concerned the FBI and other agencies are about more MAGA rioting; Biden unveiled more of his plans for his inauguration, including laying a wreath at Arlington with former presidents Bush, Clinton and Obama in a very public demonstration that Trump is an outcast; The Supreme Court declined to fast-track Trump's one-time attorney Sidney Powell's 'Kraken' compendium of discredited voter fraud claims, while the New York Bar Association started investigating Rudy Giuliani over his 'trial by combat' speech to the MAGA rally before they desecrated the Capitol; Josh Hawley was told to hand back a $5,000 donation by Hallmark as big business, led by the biggest banks, JP Morgan and Bank of America, turned off the cash spigot to him and the so-called GOP 'treason caucus.' In Congress, Democrats escalated their rhetorical attack on Trump in their article of impeachment. The latest text of the impeachment resolution cites the post-Civil War 14th amendment, noting it 'prohibits any person who has 'engaged in insurrection or rebellion against' the United States from 'hold[ing] any office . . . under the United States'. The text can be amended between now and Wednesday, but is close to previous drafts released Friday. Its formal introduction in the House came in a brief session where Hoyer stood to introduce the demand for Pence to use the 25th Amendment, asking that Republicans assent to it without objection. IMPEACHMENT: WHAT HAPPENS NOW Tuesday: House votes on telling Pence to use the 25th Amendment in the next 24 hours; majority support certain Wednesday: If Pence has not acted, House will vote on single article of impeachment Tuesday January 19: First date Senate can take up impeachment, according to Mitch McConnell Wednesday January 20, noon: Joe Biden inaugurated Wednesday January 20, 1pm: Earliest possible start to impeachment trial, according to McConnell But Democrats could hold back the Article for as much as 100 days to let Joe Biden have his cabinet picks confirmed. And Chuck Schumer, who becomes Senate leader on January 20, has offered no indication of how he plans to proceed. Advertisement In swift parliamentary action, West Virginia Republican Rep. Alex Mooney immediately objected to the request to bring up the resolution. He posted a statement on Twitter explaining his reasons, which were entirely procedural and expressed opposition to bringing it up 'without any debate on the floor,' although he also said it could 'imperil our Republic.' Mooney was one of 139 House Republicans who voted to overturn the election even after the MAGA riot. Pelosi's plan is to first try to bring up the resolution formally requesting Vice President Mike Pence invoke the 25th Amendment through the request, then follow up by bringing it before the full House. The amendment provides either for the cabinet to meet to assess the president, or a special committee to be established by Congress – although Congress has never created such a body. Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-Md.) began developing 25th amendment legislation months ago, and has examined the issue for years. The move puts pressure on Pence – who Trump publicly sought to strong-arm at the rally that proceeded the Capitol riots. Crowd members at the Capitol also screamed out calls to 'hang' Pence. Trump reportedly has not spoken with Pence since the stunning events of last week. The resolution would not carry the force of law, but it would be the first test for House Republicans, many of whom served with Pence, since a vote hours after the riot split the conference on whether to count votes where Trump has claimed fraud. A majority of Republicans voted not to count the ballots just hours after many of them had been hiding in undisclosed locations while the mob rampaged the Capitol building. Democrats believe they will get some House Republicans to sign up to impeachment, such as Adam Kinzinger, who has been outspoken in his attacks on Trump. Their biggest prize would be Republican number three Liz Cheney, who slammed members of the GOP caucus who voted against certifying the elections. House move: Democrats brought a 'unanimous consent' measure to the floor calling for Mike Pence to use the 25th Amendment but Republicans objected, meaning Democrats will force a vote on it Tuesday which would be likely to be followed by an impeachment vote Wednesday Blocked: Steny Hoyer, the House Democratic leader, brought the unanimous consent measure but Republican Alex Mooney registered an objection, forcing a vote on it Tuesday Their two-pronged attack on Republicans and Trump also separates question of Trump's fitness from some practical considerations about impeachment, since the move would take effect immediately. There is however no doubt Democrats will persist with impeachment even if Trump resigns or is removed - neither of which appear likely to happen as of Monday. Republicans who have publicly broken with Trump since Wednesday’s Capitol riots Sen. Pat Toomey (Pa.) Said Trump 'committed impeachable offenses.' Sen. Mitt Romney (Utah) Said the president had caused ‘this insurrection.’ Sen. Lisa Murkowski (Alaska) Called on Trump to resign. ‘ I want him out.’ Rep. Liz Cheney (Wyo.) Said Trump ‘caused’ the riot and called his response ‘completely inadequate’ Rep. Adam Kinzinger (Ill.) Called for Trump to resign and called 25th Amendment the ‘next best thing.’ Said he would ‘vote the right way’ on impeachment, without endorsing the tactic. Rep. Peter Meijer (Mich.) Said fellow Republicans told ‘lied’ and ‘deceived’ and called what happened an ‘act of domestic terrorism’ Advertisement They believe the constitution allows for impeachment to continue after Trump has left office. They also believe they could secure more Republican senators' support for conviction and disqualification for office after Trump leaves office than before. The backdrop for Monday's move was a House chamber still scarred by the violence of last week. The violent clash that resulted in broken windows and the shooting of a Trump supporter took place just feet away, outside the Speaker's lobby. The weekend brought fresh video footage of vicious attacks on Capitol Police officers, new clips that revealed just how close the Senate chamber was to being overrun while in session, arrests of more alleged perpetrators across the country, and the tragic suicide of a Capitol Police officer who was there for the siege. Even if the House votes Wednesday to impeach, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell wrote colleagues a trial would not likely begin until January 19th – missing the opportunity to remove Trump from office, and also complicating the start of President-elect Joe Biden's tenure. Unlike through impeachment, if Pence and a majority of the cabinet officers were to vote that Trump was unfit for office, Pence would immediately become acting president for a period of days that would run out Trump's term. The House Rules Committee is expected to meet Monday on setting the terms of debate for the impeachment vote that would likely come Wednesday. The impeachment vote itself would also split Republicans. More than 200 Democrats have already gotten behind the effort. Since Wednesday's riots, a few prominent Republicans have called for Trump to resign or be subject to impeachment. Sen. Pat Toomey (R-Pa.) said Sunday that Trump 'committed impeachable offenses.' Pelosi, having conferenced with fellow Democrats by phone, and whose office was invaded by Trump supporters who damaged her office and stole property, is demanding swift action. 'We will act with urgency, because this president represents an imminent threat to both,' she wrote Sunday. 'The horror of the ongoing assault on our democracy perpetrated by this president is intensified and so is the immediate need for action.' The impeachment vote will once again put GOP leaders on record as well. Both Minority Leader Rep. Kevin McCarthy and Minority Whip Rep. Steve Scalise voted not to seat electors certified in states that Joe Biden won. The House votes will test Republican support for Donald Trump following a Capitol riot carried out by his supporters that resulted in five deaths House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) backed Trump's claims to overturn election results after the president's supporters overran the Capitol But McCarthy was reportedly on a call 'screaming' at Trump trying to get him to publicly demand his supporters leave the Capitol at a time when lawmakers and Pence were in physical danger. Retired Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake told CNN Monday those in party leadership positions in Congress 'who went along with the president's falsehoods ... ought to face consequences in terms of their own reelection and obviously immediately in terms of leadership positions that they might hold. 'So i hope that the party has a reckoning here,' he said. The effect of the procedural moves, even if they don't result in Trump's removal from office, will be to put House Republicans on record. It could also flush out any House Republicans who have decided to break with Trump after opposing the first Democratic impeachment effort. Meanwhile, some pro-Trump House Republicans are already are already telegraphing they would seek to use impeachment against Joe Biden. 'We never think about the consequences. It's going to be like: Game on. Let's impeach [Biden] 12 times in a week,' one Democrat opposed to impeachment told Politico. The desire for action against Trump escalated over the weekend. On Sunday night. Nancy Pelosi fought to contain her emotions as she told 60 Minutes how her staff cowered under desks in the dark for two hours, as a frenzied mob of Trump supporters smashed through her office. 'I think there was, universally accepted, that what happened...' she said, pausing to compose herself. 'Was a terrible, terrible violation of what - of the Capitol, of the first branch of government, the legislative branch, by the president of the United States.' Pelosi's door was smashed down, and rioters stormed her private office. I SUFFERED TOO: MELANIA BREAKS SILENCE TO CONDEMN RIOT Melania Trump on Monday broke her silence on last week's mob attack on the Capitol, saying she 'absolutely condemns the violence' incited by her husband and calling for 'healing' as the couple prepares to leave office. Five days after the attacked that resulted in five deaths, the first lady published a statement that acknowledged the deaths of her husband's supporters before the deaths of two Capitol Police officers - and lashed out extensively at 'gossip' about her. 'My heart goes out to: Air Force Veteran, Ashli Babbit, Benjamin Philips, Kevin Greeson, Rosanne Boyland, and Capitol Police Officers, Brian Sicknick and Howard Liebengood. I pray for their families comfort and strength during this difficult time,' she wrote. But in her 600-word essay published by the White House, she quickly turned the situation to herself, slamming the 'salacious gossip, unwarranted personal attacks, and false misleading accusations on me' - a reference to reports she was conducting a photo shoot in the White House during the MAGA mob scene. 'I find it shameful that surrounding these tragic events there has been salacious gossip, unwarranted personal attacks, and false misleading accusations on me – from people who are looking to be relevant and have an agenda. This time is solely about healing our country and its citizens. It should not be used for personal gain,' she wrote in the message entitled Our Path Forward. The essay is filled with spelling errors - Babbit's name was spelled wrong - it was Babbitt - and grammatical mistakes. It also cast no blame for Wednesday's riot on her husband, who, at a rally earlier that day had encouraged his supporters to march on Capitol Hill. Melania Trump broke her silence on last week's mob attack on the Capitol, saying she 'absolutely condemns the violence' incited by her husband The first lady issued a 600-word statement called Our Path Forward which was published on the White House website early on Monday Meghan McCain, the daughter of the late senator John McCain and a frequent critic of the president, blasted Melania Trump for her statement. 'Five people died in a domestic terror attack on our own republic last week incited by her husband but Melania Trump is the victim in this?! Every morning I think I can’t get more disgusted....,' Meghan McCain tweeted. While Melania has largely stayed quiet during Donald Trump's attempts to illegally reverse the election results, she has echoed the president's misleading language of 'counting legal votes' and has not publicly acknowledged Joe Biden's victory. But she wrote in her latest message that 'it has been the honor of my lifetime to serve as your first lady', a tacit acknowledgement that her term is nearly over. Biden takes the oath of office on January 20th. It's unclear what's in store for Melania Trump after life in the White House. She has been reportedly looking at schools for son Barron in Florida but has made no indication she plans to keep up her 'Be Best' campaign or her work with the military once her husband leaves office. The first lady has been spending her final days in the White House behind closed doors. She and her husband have rarely been seen since their return from Florida on December 31st, where they were spending the holidays at Mar-a-Lago. Melania's message was published early on Monday morning, three days after the president was permanently banned from Twitter - with Trump not showing his face since promising an orderly transition in a video message on Thursday. And while Donald Trump Jr and Eric Trump had appeared at a campaign rally Wednesday morning where the president whipped his supporters into a frenzy shortly before they besieged the Capitol, the first lady stayed out of sight during the day of chaos. Two of her staff quit in protest of the president's handling of the riots: her chief of Staff Stephanie Grisham and social secretary Anna Cristina 'Rickie' Niceta. As a White House source told The Mail on Sunday that during Wednesday's siege of the Capitol, the first lady was in the East Wing of the White House overseeing a photoshoot for a new coffee table book about presidential artifacts. 'The heart of US government was under siege, our very democracy on the line, but Mrs Trump was calmly arranging porcelain figurines for the photographer,' the source said, saying even the most loyal remaining Trump staffers were left 'dumbfounded' by her actions. Aides even asked Melania to intercede on Wednesday, to force her husband to publicly decry the insurgency, but she refused. 'She said nothing. She remained silent and carried on arranging a vase for the shoot. She checked out of this presidency and her marriage a long time ago.' Additionally, Stephanie Winston Wolkoff, who worked in the East Wing in the early days of the administration and then wrote a memoir of her time there that painted Melania in an unflattering light, wrote in The Daily Beast over the weekend that she is 'ashamed' to have ever worked for the first lady. ‘I can’t believe how blind I was to the depth of her deception and lack of common decency,’ Wolkoff wrote. Without mentioning those claims directly in her statement on Monday, Melania condemned what she said were 'false misleading accusations on me' from 'people who are looking to be relevant and have an agenda'. The first lady said she was praying for the families of the four protesters and two Capitol Police officers who died in the hours and days after the attack. She added that 'our nation must heal in a civil manner', after President Trump initially praised the mob as 'very special' but later condemned the violence. 'Make no mistake about it, I absolutely condemn the violence that has occurred on our Nation's Capitol. Violence is never acceptable,' she wrote. Police casualties: Officer Brian Sicknick was murdered, allegedly by being hit with a fire extinguisher. Officer Howard Liebengood took his own life on Saturday morning Dead rioters: Ashli Babbitt was shot by a Capitol Hill officer as she tried to smash her way into the Speaker's Lobby. Rosanne Boyland died in the Rotunda; she is thought to have been trampled to death by the mob Dead rioters: Benjamin Philips organized a bus trip of MAGA fanatics from Bloomsburg, PA, and died, possibly of a stroke, having posted that it was'the first day of the rest of our lives.' Kevin Greeson had a heart attack. In recent days he posted on Parler: 'Let's take this f***ing country back,' posed with two AR-15-style rifles and a handgun and spewed abuse about Nancy Pelosi Advertisement Nancy Pelosi closed her eyes and took a minute to compose herself, speaking about the riot Nancy Pelosi, in a 60 Minutes interview on Sunday, showed Stahl the destruction in her office Pelosi's employees cowered under this table in the dark for two hours as the mob roamed Rioters draped in Trump flags are pictured rampaging through Pelosi's office One man is seen photographing a picture from Pelosi's office, having broken into the room Trump supporters in their MAGA caps played with Pelosi's office furniture The mob of Trump supporters chanted Pelosi's name as they rampaged through the building 'The staff went under the table, barricaded the door, turned out the lights, and were silent in the dark,' Pelosi said, showing 60 Minutes interviewer Lesley Stahl the damage. 'Under the table for two and a half hours.' During this time in hiding, they listened to the invaders banging on that door. Pelosi's team cowered, praying the mob did not find them. 'You see what they did to the mirror there? The glass was all over the place,' said Pelosi. 'They took a computer and all that stuff. 'And then the desk that they actually were at was right there that they defamed in that way, feet on the desk and all that.' One of the rioters, Richard Barnett, 60, was pictured putting his feet up on her desk. The MAGA rioter who put his feet up on Nancy Pelosi 's desk was arrested at home in Arkansas Barnett, who proudly referred to himself as a white nationalist on social media, was federally charged with unlawful entry. He was taken into custody at his home in Little Rock, Arkansas. Richard Barnett, 60, has been charged with unlawful entry Another, Cleveland Grover Meredith Jr, allegedly wrote in a text to a friend that he was thinking of 'putting a bullet in [Pelosi's] noggin on Live TV'. Another text allegedly reads: 'I'm gonna run that c**t Pelosi over while she chews on her gums.' According to officials, a third text from Meredith, who is a married, father-of-two, says he has 'a sh*t ton of … armor piercing ammo'. Meredith is one of 13 people who have been charged with federal crimes. Pelosi told Stahl: 'The evidence is now that it was a well-planned, organized group with leadership and guidance and direction. And the direction was to go get people. 'They were vocally saying, 'Where's the speaker? We know she has staff. They're here someplace. We're going to find them.'' Cleveland Grover Meredith Jr (pictured) allegedly texted friends that he wanted to shoot or run over Nancy Pelosi While the mayhem was unfurling, Pelosi and other Congressmen had been taken to a safe location. She was unaware until later what had happened in her office. 'When the protesters were making the assault on the Capitol, before they even got to these doors, the Capitol Police pulled me from the podium,' she said. 'And I was concerned because I said: 'No, I want to be here.' 'And they said: 'Well, no, you have to leave.' 'I said: 'No, I'm not leaving.' 'They said: 'No, you must leave.'' Pelosi said that she was disgusted that some Congressmen still voted to overthrow the election results, when the session resumed. 'After the violence. Shame on them,' she said. 'And shame on two-thirds of the Republican caucus in the House supporting... so these people are enablers of the president's behavior.' Pelosi wrote to her Democrat colleagues on Sunday night to explain the next steps On Sunday night Pelosi wrote to her Democrat colleagues to say that, unless Mike Pence invokes the powers of the 25th Amendment to remove Trump from office, they will proceed with impeachment. Trump could become the only president to be impeached twice. 'In protecting our Constitution and our Democracy, we will act with urgency, because this President represents an imminent threat to both,' she said, and added: 'The horror of the ongoing assault on our democracy perpetrated by this President is intensified and so is the immediate need for action.' She, and other Democrats, further fear the president could pardon those involved in the storming of the Capitol in his final days. With impeachment planning intensifying, two Republican senators said they want Trump to resign immediately as efforts mounted to prevent Trump from ever again holding elective office in the wake of deadly riots at the Capitol. House Democrats were expected to introduce articles of impeachment on Monday. The strategy would be to condemn the president's actions swiftly but delay an impeachment trial in the Senate for 100 days. That would allow President-elect Joe Biden to focus on other priorities as soon as he is inaugurated on January 20. Jim Clyburn, the third-ranking House Democrat and a top Biden ally, laid out the ideas on Sunday as the country came to grips with the siege at the Capitol by Trump loyalists trying to overturn the election results. 'Let's give President-elect Biden the 100 days he needs to get his agenda off and running,' Clyburn said. Pressure was mounting for Trump to leave office even before his term ended amid alarming concerns of more unrest ahead of the inauguration.

Senator Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania on Sunday joined his fellow Republican Senator Lisa Murkowski of Alaska in calling for Trump to 'resign and go away as soon as possible.' 'I think the president has disqualified himself from ever, certainly, serving in office again,' Toomey said. 'I don't think he is electable in any way.' Murkowski, who has long voiced her exasperation with Trump's conduct in office, told the Anchorage Daily News on Friday that Trump simply 'needs to get out.' A third Republican, Sen. Roy Blunt, of Missouri, did not go that far, but on Sunday he warned Trump to be 'very careful' in his final days in office. Corporate America began to tie its reaction to the Capitol riots by tying them to campaign contributions. Blue Cross Blue Shield Association's CEO and President Kim Keck said it will not contribute to those lawmakers — all Republicans — who supported challenges to Biden's Electoral College win. The group 'will suspend contributions to those lawmakers who voted to undermine our democracy,' Kim said. Citigroup did not single out lawmakers aligned with Trump's effort to overturn the election, but said it would be pausing all federal political donations for the first three months of the year. Citi's head of global government affairs, Candi Wolff, said in a Friday memo to employees, 'We want you to be assured that we will not support candidates who do not respect the rule of law.' Lisa Murkowski, senator for Alaska, has said she is considering quitting the Republicans Murkowski said that Trump should resign, saying he had done enough damage Trump supporters, egged on by the president himself, stormed the Capitol on Wednesday House leaders, furious after the insurrection, appear determined to act against Trump despite the short timeline. Mike Pence 'has not ruled out the 25th Amendment' Mike Pence and Donald Trump have not spoken since Wednesday's uprising, CNN reported, during which pro-Trump rioters charged through the Senate looking for Pence and threatening to 'hang' him. Trump was angered by Pence telling him he was not constitutionally able to overturn the election, and lashed out at his vice president on Wednesday, telling supporters: 'Mike Pence has to come through for us. If he doesn't that will be a sad day for our country.' He later tweeted: 'Mike Pence didn't have the courage to do what should have been done to protect our Country and our Constitution.' Pence has finally 'gotten a glimpse of POTUS's vindictiveness,' one source told CNN. It is the first time the normally-loyal Pence has publicly broken with the president. CNN said that Pence has not ruled out the 25th Amendment. Invoking the 25th Amendment would require Pence and a majority of the Cabinet to vote to remove Trump from office due to his inability to 'discharge the powers and duties of his office' - an unprecedented step. On Thursday, sources close to the VP said it was 'highly unlikely' Pence would attempt to invoke the 25th Amendment. He has not ruled it out, however. Advertisement Mitch McConnell, the Senate Majority Leader, has said an impeachment trial could not begin under the current calendar before Inauguration Day. While many have criticized Trump, Republicans have said that impeachment would be divisive in a time of unity. Senator Marco Rubio said that instead of coming together, Democrats want to 'talk about ridiculous things like 'Let's impeach a president' with just days left in office. Still, some Republicans might be supportive. Nebraska Sen. Ben Sasse said he would take a look at any articles that the House sent over. Illinois Rep. Adam Kinzinger, a frequent Trump critic, said he would 'vote the right way' if the matter were put in front of him. The Democratic effort to stamp Trump's presidential record — for the second time — with the indelible mark of impeachment had advanced rapidly since the riot. Rep. David Cicilline, D-R.I, a leader of the House effort to draft impeachment articles accusing Trump of inciting insurrection, said Sunday that his group had 200-plus co-sponsors. The articles, if passed by the House, could then be transmitted to the Senate for a trial, with senators acting as jurors to acquit or convict Trump. If convicted, Trump would be removed from office and succeeded by the vice president. It would be the first time a U.S. president had been impeached twice. Potentially complicating Pelosi's decision about impeachment was what it meant for Biden and the beginning of his presidency. While reiterating that he had long viewed Trump as unfit for office, Biden on Friday sidestepped a question about impeachment, saying what Congress did 'is for them to decide.' While some Democrats are pushing for the impeachment route, the House Speaker told 60 Minutes that she prefers invoking the 25th Amendment because it gets Trump out of office immediately. 'There is a possibility that after all of this, there's no punishment, no consequence, and he could run again for president,' Stahl said to Pelosi in a clip released ahead of airing the full interview. 'And that's one of the motivations that people have for advocating for impeachment,' Pelosi explained. She is, however, concerned that if Trump is not booted from the White House right now, he will use his last 10 days in office to pardon those part of the mob who descended on the Capitol Wednesday – or even himself and other allies. 'I like the 25th Amendment because it gets rid of him – he's out of office,' Pelosi said. 'But there is strong support in the Congress for impeaching the president a second time.' 'What if he pardons himself?' Stahl asked. 'What if pardons these people who are terrorists on the Capitol?' Pelosi shot back. Congress is moving to prosecute or punish any and all they can find who were involved in the riots at the Capitol – and have already found some who were pictured prominently. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez said Sunday in an interview with ABC's 'This Week' that half of the members of the House were at risk of dying during the riots. 'Perhaps my colleagues were not fully present for the events on Wednesday, but we came close to half of the House nearly dying on Wednesday,' Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez said Sunday of the pro-Trump mob descending on the Capitol House Majority Whip Jim Clyburn said Sunday that Democrats will vote on impeachment this week, but said the party might wait until after Joe Biden's first 100 days in office to move the articles to the Senate WHAT DOES THE 25TH AMENDMENT SAY? CAN TRUMP'S CABINET REALLY TOPPLE HIM? The 25th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution deals with presidential authority in the event of death or removal from office, and was ratified in 1967, in the wake of John F Kennedy's assassination. What does the 25th Amendment say? It is in four sections, all dealing with the president leaving office during his or her elected term. The first section states that the vice president takes over the Oval Office if the president dies or resigns – or is removed – something which the original Constitution did not clearly state. Presidents of course can be removed by impeachment, a feature of the constitution from the start. They can also be removed through the 25th Amendment - of which more below. Section II states that if the vice president dies, or resigns – or is fired – both the House and Senate have to confirm a new vice president. Until 1967, presidents could change vice presidents mid-term on their own if they got the vice president to agree to resign - not something that actually happened, but which was possible in principle. Section III makes clear that a president can temporarily delegate his powers to the vice president, and later reclaim them when he - or she - is capable of serving. This is most often invoked if a president is under the influence of surgical anesthetic for a short period of time. Section IV is the amendment's most controversial part: it describes how the president can be removed from office if he is incapacitated and does not leave on his own. The vice president and 'a majority of either the principal officers of the executive departments or of such other body as Congress may by law provide' must write to both the president pro tempore of the Senate and the Speaker of the House, saying that 'the President is unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office.' The term principal officers of the executive departments would normally mean the cabinet secretaries. So at least eight of the president's 15 most senior Cabinet members together with the vice president must agree that a president should be removed before any plan can move forward. Notifying the House Speaker and the Senate president pro tempore is the act that immediately elevates the vice president to an 'acting president' role. The deposed president can contest the claim, giving the leaders of the bloodless coup four days to re-assert their claims to the House and Senate. Congress then has two days to convene – unless it is already in session – and another 21 days to vote on whether the president is incapable of serving. A two-thirds majority in both houses is required to make that determination. As soon as there is a vote with a two-thirds majority, the president loses his powers and is removed, and the vice president stops acting and is sworn in as president. But if 21 days of debate and votes ends without a two-thirds majority, the president gets back his powers. What could happen to trigger the 25th Amendment? Vice President Mike Pence and eight of the 15 'principal' Cabinet members would have to agree to notify Congress that President Donald Trump was incapable of running the country. That group is made up of the Secretary of State, Treasury Secretary, Secretary of Defense, Attorney General, Interior Secretary, Agriculture Secretary, Commerce Secretary, Labor Secretary, Health and Human Services Secretary, Transportation Secretary, Energy Secretary , Education Secretary, Veterans Affairs Secretary and Homeland Security Secretary. Their formal notification would go to the House Speaker and, in the senate, to the 'president pro tempore', the Senate's most senior member. As soon as the letter is sent, Pence would become 'acting president.' Alternatively, Congress could set up its own mechanism to decide if he is fit for office - maybe a commission, or a joint committee. Pence would still have to agree with its conclusion and then write formally to the Speaker and president pro tempore. Or another possibility is that the pool of 'principal officers' is considered to be bigger than the 15 and a majority of that group call Trump incapable. What if Trump does not agree? If Trump claims he is capable of holding office, he would write to the House Speaker and the president pro tempore of the Senate within four days, setting up three weeks of intense debate in both houses of Congress. Trump would be removed from office if both two-thirds majorities in both the House and Senate agreed with Pence and his cabal. If either of both chambers fell short of that mark, Trump would retain his powers and likely embark on a wholesale housecleaning, firing Pence and replacing disloyal Cabinet members. Are there any loopholes? The 25th Amendment allows Congress to appoint its own panel to evaluate the president instead of relying on the Cabinet – the men and women who work most closely with Trump – to decide on a course of action. It specifies that some 'other body as Congress may by law provide' could play that role, but Pence would still need to agree with any finding that the president is incapable of discharging his duties. That commission could hypothetically include anyone from presidential historians to psychiatrists, entrusted to assess the president's fitness for office. Another loophole is that it does not spell out that the Cabinet is needed to agree, but says that the 'principal officers' of the departments are needed. That term is undefined in the constitution. In some departments legislation appears to name not just the secretary but deputies and even undersecretaries as 'principal officers', so many more people could be called in to the assessment of Trump's fitness. But Trump's cabinet has a swathe of 'acting' cabinet officer - and it is unclear if they could therefore take part in removing him. Could Trump fire Pence if he rebelled? No. The vice president can resign or be impeached and removed - but he does not serve at the pleasure of the president. Is there any precedent for this? No. Only Section III, the voluntary surrender of presidential powers, has ever been used - and only very briefly. In December 1978, President Jimmy Carter thought about invoking Section III when he was contemplating a surgical procedure to remove hemorrhoids. Presidents Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush both voluntarily relinquished their powers while undergoing procedures under anesthetic. Section IV has also never been invoked, although there have been claims that Ronald Reagan's chief of staff Donald Regan told his successor, Howard Baker, in 1987 that he should be prepared to invoke it because Reagan was inattentive and inept. The PBS documentary 'American Experience' recounts how Baker and his team watched Reagan closely for signs of incapacity during their first meeting and decided he was in perfect command of himself. Advertisement 'If another head of state came in and ordered an attack on the United States Congress, would we say that that should not be prosecuted? Would we say that there should be absolutely no response to that?' the New York congresswoman told ABC host George Stephanopoulos. 'No,' Ocasio-Cortez asserted. 'It is an act of insurrection. It's an act of hostility. And we must have accountability, because, without it, it will happen again. 'Perhaps my colleagues were not fully present for the events on Wednesday, but we came close to half of the House nearly dying on Wednesday,' she said. Hakeem Jeffries, a fellow New York Representative, agreed with AOC's points in an interview with NBC on Sunday, claiming: 'Donald Trump represents a clear and present danger to the health and safety of the American people, as well as our democracy' The representative, as well as the handful of members of her progressive 'squad', are fully on board with plans to again impeach President Trump. Clyburn said Sunday that articles have already been drawn and he is expecting a vote in the lower chamber in the coming day. 'I think that will come – probably Tuesday, and maybe Wednesday, but it will happen this week,' the No. 3 House Democrat told 'Fox News Sunday' when asked about the House taking action to impeach Trump. 'The rest of the articles have been drawn up.' 'If we are the people's House, let's do the people's work and vote to impeach this president,' Clyburn continued in his interview with Fox's Chris Wallace. 'And then we'll decide later — or the Senate will decide later — what to do with that impeachment.' Ocasio-Cortez said 'every minute' Trump is still in office, there is a looming threat. 'I absolutely believe that impeachment should be scheduled for several reasons,' she said on Sunday. 'Our main priority is to ensure the removal of Donald Trump as president of the United States,' AOC added. 'Every minute and every hour that he is in office represents a clear and present danger, not just to the United States Congress, but, frankly, to the country.' While Democrats pursue impeachment, many lawmakers from both sides of the aisle are calling for Trump to step down on his own volition to prevent Congress from having to intervene. Lawmakers were forced to evacuate the House and Senate chambers and shelter in offices or other locations on Wednesday after thousands of Donald Trump's supporters breached the Capitol and rioted through the halls There are also talks of banning Trump from running for president again in the future – as speculation mounts he will pursue another run for the White House in 2024. 'In addition to removal, we're also talking about complete barring of the president – or, rather, of Donald Trump from running for office ever again,' Ocasio-Cortez told ABC. 'And, in addition to that, the potential ability to prevent pardoning himself from those charges that he was impeached for.' Jeffries also wants immediate action against Trump, expressing concern that the president still has 'access to the nuclear codes.' 'The goal at the present moment is to address the existential threat that Donald Trump presents at this time. Every second, every minute, every hour that Donald Trump remains in office presents a danger to the American people,' the Democrat representative said on Sunday during an interview on 'Meet the Press'. 'You know, Donald Trump may be in the Twitter penalty box, but he still has access to the nuclear codes,' Jeffries said, referencing Trump's indefinite ban from Twitter. 'That's a frightening prospect.' He added: 'Donald Trump is completely and totally out of control, and even his longtime enablers have now come to that conclusion.' Clyburn, however, said Sunday that House Democrats are weighing if they should hold off on sending the articles of impeachment to the Senate until after Joe Biden's first 100 days in office. This way, Democrats would allow the new president to install key members of his team and would have a new 50-50 split Senate to work with."", ""The two top Democrats in Congress, Sen. Charles Schumer and Speaker Nancy Pelosi, reached out directly to Vice President Mike Pence Thursday to try to push him to act immediately to remove President Trump from office, only to be rebuffed. The two leaders called Pence hours after he had overseen a Joint Session of Congress to count the electoral votes to make Joe Biden the next president, despite intense pressure by President Trump that Pence move against it. Late Thursday sources told CNN that Trump's mental state was deteriorating and he was 'ranting' and 'raving' as he watched the 25th Amendment being discussed on television - with Pelosi and Schumer's demand being played repeatedly. But if they had hopes that Pence might join in a speedy potential effort to seize the reins of power from a volatile Trump in his final days in office, the reception they got may provide an answer. 'Speaker Pelosi and I tried to call the vice president this morning to tell him to do this,' Schumer told reporters in New York Thursday. 'They kept us on hold for 25 minutes and then said the Vice President wouldn't come on the phone.' 'So we are making this call public because he should do it and do it right away,' Schumer said, explaining why both he and Pelosi are calling on Pence and the Trump cabinet to invoke the 25th Amendment to declare Trump unfit and install Pence as president in an acting capacity. The call preceded furious comments from Pelosi charging Trump with fomenting 'insurrection' and inciting 'sedition.' 'Yesterday the President of the United States incited an armed insurrection against America,' Pelosi said at a Capitol press conference a day after Trump supporters stormed the building after attending a rally where Trump spoke. She used stark language beyond even the tough talk of impeachment in last December and January, accusing him of crimes against the nation he leads. 'In calling for this seditious act, the president has committed an unspeakable assault on our nation and our people,' said Pelosi. Unlike 2019 and 2020 she has just days to force through an impeachment, but this time has a far greater chance that 12 Republican senators join the Democrats to convict after some openly expressed disgust for the president or his actions. Among those Democrats would target are Pennsylvania's retiring Pat Toomey and ultra-conservative Tom Cotton, Utah's Mike Lee and Ohio's Rob Portman. In a series of developments Thursday: Just after 1pm, another bombshell dropped as Elaine Chao, the transportation secretary and wife of Mitch McConnell resigned over the violence - the first member of Trump's cabinet to quit Democratic House members circulated draft articles of impeachment accusing Trump of inciting violent sedition and being a threat to national security Facebook banned Trump from his account until at least his last day in office and possibly indefinitely Joe Biden - unprompted - raised the use of the 25th Amendment as he called the mobs 'an assault on democracy' Washington D.C, prosecutors say Trump is being investigated for inciting the riots while Lindsey Graham said if the president does one more thing he should be removed Former Attorney General Bill Barr said 'orchestrating a mob to pressure Congress is inexcusable' White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany abruptly called a press briefing Thursday evening where she condemned violence but did not take responsibility for it House Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Thursday said President Donald Trump had incited 'sedition' against the United States as she and Sen. Chuck Schumer demanded the president's removal from office Pelosi applied pressure to Vice President Mike Pence and urged him to invoke the 25th Amendment to remove Trump from office. Both Democrat leaders called Pence to demand Trump's removal from office - but were put on hold. Pence is pictured Thursday being escorted to the House Chamber 'What happened at the U.S. Capitol yesterday was an insurrection against the United States, incited by the president. This president should not hold office one day longer,' Chuck Schumer said in a statement Thursday Pelosi tweeted shortly after her press conference: 'Trump is deadly to our democracy and our people. He needs to go now' Amid the focus on methods of removing the president from office, the New York Times reported that the President Trump has spoken to his advisors about the possibility of granting himself a self-pardon in the days before he leaves office. It is an untested question courts would consider a self-pardon by the president valid. Richard Nixon was pardoned by President Gerald Ford when he resigned after Watergate. Trump has told advisors since Election Day that he was thinking about the idea, even as he doled out pardons to political supporters like former national security advisor Gen. Mike Flynn, who withdrew his guilty plea to lying to the FBI in the Russia probe. Trump has tweeted that he has the power to self-pardon but has said he doesn't need one. The U.S. Attorney in D.C. said Thursday that the office would investigate those who instigated the rioters who stormed the Capitol, not just the vandals themselves. WHO'S QUIT TRUMP ADMINISTRATION SINCE MAGA MOBBED CAPITOL HILL? Education Secretary Betsy DeVos Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao Acting Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf Hope Hicks - who said it was not related to riots Melania Trump's Chief of Staff Stephanie Grisham White House Social Secretary Rickie Niceta Deputy National Security Advisor Matt Pottinger Deputy Assistant Secretary of Commerce for Intelligence and Security John Costello Special Envoy for Northern Ireland and former OMB Director and White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney The National Security Council's Senior Director for Europe and Russia Ryan Tully Deputy Press Secretary Sarah Matthews Entire non-career staff of the Federal Aviation Administration Advertisement Trump has also considered pardons for family members Ivanka Trump, Donald Trump Jr., Eric Trump, and son-in-law Jared Kushner. He also has considered one for personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani, who addressed the rally crowd Wednesday urging 'trial by combat.' The talks came before Monday's events, and also before Trump's Jan. 2 call to Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, whom her urged to 'find' 11,780 votes that would make him the winner there, in a call leaked to the Washington Post. That call could bring legal exposure for potential violation of laws on interfering in an election. State officials have said they are looking into it. Trump could only pardon himself from federal crimes. Wednesday's chaotic events are unlikely to prompt Trump to abandon thoughts of pardoning himself. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Thursday he had incited an armed insurrection against America.' Pelosi applied pressure to Vice President Mike Pence – who presided over at joint session to count the electoral votes to make Joe Biden president in a race Trump falsely claims he won – and urged him to invoke the 25th Amendment to remove Trump from office. 'The gleeful desecration of the U.S. Capitol, which is the temple of our American democracy, and the violence targeting Congress, are horrors that will forever stain our nation's history – instigated by the president of the United States. That's why it's such a stain,' she intoned. 'By inciting sedition like he did yesterday, he must be removed from office,' she said of Trump. 'While it's only 13 days left, any day can be a horror show for America,' she said of Trump's remaining time in office. 'I join the Senate Democratic leader in calling on the vice president to remove this president by immediately invoking the 25th amendment. If the vice president and cabinet do not act, the Congress may be prepared to move forward with impeachment,' she said. She said it was an idea backed by her caucus. Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer made a similar threat in a brief statement earlier Thursday. She called Trump 'a complete tool of Putin.' 'Putin's goal was to diminish the view of democracy in the world. That's what he has been about ... the president gave him the biggest, of all of his many gifts to Putin, the biggest yesterday,' she said of the Russian president. Pelosi tweeted shortly after her event: 'Trump is deadly to our democracy and our people. He needs to go now.' Schumer will become majority leader once Joe Biden is sworn in. He spoke out amid escalating concern among Trump cabinet officials, former top aides, and his recently departed attorney general Bill Barr about the president's conduct and continued risks the president could pose to the country. But there was no indication of how Republicans will act - and early in the afternoon, Elaine Chao, the Transportation Secretary and wife of Mitch McConnell quit, a move which stops her taking part in removing Trump from office. 'The quickest and most effective way - it can be done today - to remove this president from office would be for the Vice President to immediately invoke the 25th amendment,' Schumer said. 'If the Vice President and the Cabinet refuse to stand up, Congress should reconvene to impeach the president,' Schumer added. His statement came shortly after Republican Rep. Adam Kinzinger of Illinois became the first elected House Republican to call for the Trump cabinet and Pence to invoke the 25th Amendment to strip away Trump's power. Republican congressman Adam Kinzinger demanded Mike Pence and the Cabinet remove Donald Trump by invoking the 25th Amendment immediately. He posted a video to Twitter in which he said he is calling for Donald Trump to be removed from office 'for the sake of our Democracy' 'It's with a heavy heart I am calling for the sake of our Democracy that the 25th Amendment be invoked,' Kinzinger said in a statement he posted on Twitter.' Kinzinger said Trump 'invoked and inflamed passions that only gave fuel to the insurrection we saw.' His comment followed reporters that members of Trump's cabinet have been discussing use of the 25th Amendment to the constitution to declare him unfit for office Rep. David Cicilline (D-R.I.) has released articles of impeachment he has drafted with Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-Md.) and Rep. Ted Lieu (D-Calif.). The articles state that Trump 'engaged in high crimes and misdemeanors' by 'willfully inciting violence against the Government of the United States.' The articles cite Trump's Wednesday remarks to supporters shortly before they stormed the Capitol during the electoral vote count. 'Shortly before the Joint Session of Congress commenced,' Trump addressed supporters where he 'reiterated false claims that 'we won this election, and we won it by a landslide,' the articles state. Trump also 'wilfully made statements that encouraged – and foreseeably resulted in – imminent lawless action at the Capitol.' AOC says Cabinet should use 25th Amendment and Congress should impeach - and wants Republican inciters expelled from House and Senate The articles say a mob 'incited by President Trump' breached the Capitol and 'interfered with the Joint Session's solemn constitutional duty' to certify the results. They say the actions were 'consistent with his prior efforts to subvert and obstruct' the certification of the results. They mention his Jan. 2 phone call with Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, where he asked the official to 'find' 11,780 votes that would give him victory. Georgia certified the vote for Joe Biden. Trump 'gravely endangered the security' of the U.S. and its institutions of government, the articles say. IT calls his actions 'grossly incompatible with self-governance and the rule of law.' If Trump were impeached and convicted, he would be unable to hold future office of 'honor, trust or profit' under the U.S Joe Biden said he would not be taking questions on whether the 25th amendment should be used to remove President Trump from office. Biden made the statement at the top of his announcement of his nominee for attorney general, explaining he wants to 'focus on the ideas today' instead. 'I know you will have a lot of questions, but I want to focus on the idea today, the judiciary as well as talking about the attorney general's office so I'll have time to answer the questions you want to ask about everything from 25th amendment but I won't speak to that today. I want this to be the issue to focus because I think it's so important,' he told the room of reporters in Wilmington, Del. Biden went on to call Wednesday's attack on the Capitol as 'one of the darkest days in the history of our nation.' He called the mob 'domestic terrorists.' 'They weren't protesters. Don't dare call them protesters. They were a riotous mob, insurrectionists. Domestic terrorists,' he said. Rep. Ilhan Omar has presented article's of impeachment. 'We need to move quickly to remove this President from office,' she said Rep. David Cicilline (D-R.I.) has released articles of impeachment he has drafted with Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-Md.) and Rep. Ted Lieu (D-Calif.). The articles state that Trump 'engaged in high crimes and misdemeanors' by 'willfully inciting violence against the Government of the United States' Former Attorney General Bill Barr – who departed his post before Christmas – called out Trump for 'orchestrating a mob.' Barr called it a 'betrayal of his office and supporters.' He told the Associated Press that 'orchestrating a mob to pressure Congress is inexcusable.' The talk of using the 25th Amendment comes amid fears of what damage Trump might we able to due even in the short two weeks left in his tenure as aides flee his White House and he continues to lash out at enemies – with control of the military and massive executive power. Several House Democrats have begun talk of rushing through an impeachment, after the failed January impeachment trial in the Senate. The 25th Amendment, which also governs a president who voluntarily relinquishes power on a temporary basis, requires that the vice president and 'a majority of either the principal officers of the executive departments or of such other body as Congress may by law provide' inform the Congress that the president is 'unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office.' Former Attorney General Bill Barr has said 'orchestrating a mob to pressure Congress is inexcusable' Game over: Mike Pence put the final seal on Joe Biden's election victory in the early hours of Thursday morning, declaring once and for all that Donald Trump had lost the election by a 306-232 margin in the electoral college Rep.

Trump would be removed from office if both two-thirds majorities in both the House and Senate agreed with Pence and his cabal. If either of both chambers fell short of that mark, Trump would retain his powers and likely embark on a wholesale housecleaning, firing Pence and replacing disloyal Cabinet members. Are there any loopholes? The 25th Amendment allows Congress to appoint its own panel to evaluate the president instead of relying on the Cabinet – the men and women who work most closely with Trump – to decide on a course of action. It specifies that some 'other body as Congress may by law provide' could play that role, but Pence would still need to agree with any finding that the president is incapable of discharging his duties. That commission could hypothetically include anyone from presidential historians to psychiatrists, entrusted to assess the president's fitness for office. Another loophole is that it does not spell out that the Cabinet is needed to agree, but says that the 'principal officers' of the departments are needed. That term is undefined in the constitution. In some departments legislation appears to name not just the secretary but deputies and even undersecretaries as 'principal officers', so many more people could be called in to the assessment of Trump's fitness. But Trump's cabinet has a swathe of 'acting' cabinet officer - and it is unclear if they could therefore take part in removing him. Could Trump fire Pence if he rebelled? No. The vice president can resign or be impeached and removed - but he does not serve at the pleasure of the president. Is there any precedent for this? No. Only Section III, the voluntary surrender of presidential powers, has ever been used - and only very briefly. In December 1978, President Jimmy Carter thought about invoking Section III when he was contemplating a surgical procedure to remove hemorrhoids. Presidents Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush both voluntarily relinquished their powers while undergoing procedures under anesthetic. Section IV has also never been invoked, although there have been claims that Ronald Reagan's chief of staff Donald Regan told his successor, Howard Baker, in 1987 that he should be prepared to invoke it because Reagan was inattentive and inept. The PBS documentary 'American Experience' recounts how Baker and his team watched Reagan closely for signs of incapacity during their first meeting and decided he was in perfect command of himself. Advertisement In another blow to Trump, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg said Trump will be blocked from both the Facebook and Instagram platforms at least through Inauguration Day, because the risks are 'too great.' Several Trump cabinet members serve on an 'acting' basis and have not been confirmed by the Senate, lowering the number from the threshold of 16 department heads who would take part in a 25th Amendment scenario. A post election purge took out the Defense secretary, and Attorney General Bill Barr. Half the cabinet would have to vote, and Pence would then submit information to the Congress, making him acting president while other processes go forward. Kinzinger for years has been an outlier in the GOP conference, bashing Trump publicly and in cable TV interviews when he believes Trump runs astray of democratic norms. But his public statement, made from his Capitol office in front of a U.S. flag, illustrates how quickly the possibility of action has jumped from fantasy to reality after Wednesday's stunning events in the Capitol. The new talk of the 25th Amendment came as officials in the Trump administration continued to resign and issued statements denouncing Trump's conduct. Former White House acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney quit his diplomatic post in protest of the effort to 'overtake the government.' 'I can't do it,' said Mulvaney, who called Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, another former House Republican, to convey his views. Mulvaney, a former House member from South Carolina who left Congress to join Trump's team, spoke out on CNBC hours after a pro-Trump mob stormed the Capitol after being egged on to march there by President Trump and his unsupported claims of mass election fraud. 'I called Mike Pompeo last night to let him know I was resigning from that. I can't do it. I can't stay,' he said, relinquishing his post as special U.S. envoy to Northern Ireland in the final weeks of the Trump Administration. He said he 'wouldn't be surprised' to see 'more of my friends resign over the next 24 to 48 hours.' Mulvaney served in the House with Pompeo. 'Those who choose to stay, and I have talked with some of them, are choosing to stay because they're worried the President might put someone worse,' he said – voicing an argument made by many top Trump officials who lingered for months or years despite harboring doubts they later shared about Trump'I can't stay here. Not after yesterday,' he said – with a model of Air Force One and a presidential seal in the background behind him during a video interview. Agriculture secretary Sonny Perdue said he was not quitting and had not discussed the 25th Amendment with Pence or anyone else, CNN reported. But he did condemn Trump, saying: 'Inciting people to not have a peaceful transition of power was not the right thing to do.' Donald Trump - pictured at the Wednesday rally near the White House where he whipped his supporters into a frenzy by repeating his false claims of election fraud - finally accepted his fate on Thursday morning and promised an 'orderly transition' on January 20, when Joe Biden will take office after being confirmed once and for all as the election winner Trump's grudging acknowledgement that Joe Biden will take office on January 20 was posted on Twitter by White House aide Dan Scavino, after the president's own account was locked for stirring up violence on Wednesday Thousands of Donald Trump's most fervent supporters descended on Capitol Hill Wednesday to protest the results of the presidential election and obstruct Congress from certifying Joe Biden's victory Acting Department of Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf called the actions by Trump supporters who rampaged through the Capitol 'sickening' – and publicly pleaded with President Trump to condemn the violence. 'What transpired yesterday was tragic and sickening,' Wolf said in a statement Thursday. 'While I have consistently condemned political violence on both sides of the aisle, specifically violence directed at law enforcement, we now see some supporters of the President using violence as a means to achieve political ends. This is unacceptable. These violent actions are unconscionable, and I implore the President and all elected officials to strongly condemn the violence that took place yesterday,' Wolf said. 'DHS takes the safety and security of all Americans very seriously—it's at the core of our mission to defend our homeland. Any appearance of inciting violence by an elected official goes against who we are as Americans,' Wolf continued. He said he would remain in his post 'to ensure the Department's focus remains on the serious threats facing our country and an orderly transition to President-elect Biden's DHS team.' Guns on the floor of the House: Capitol police point their firearms at a vandalized door during the hours-long carnage that erupted on Wednesday after Trump told his supporters to protest the election result Mockery: A Trump supporter puts his feet up on House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's desk after storming into the Capitol during an unprecedented effort to subvert a democratic election and keep Donald Trump in power Fire and fury: The flash of a police munition lights up the steps of the Capitol during the invasion by a Trump-incited mob A huge crowd of Trump supporters had turned up at the president's urging to protest the results of a fair democratic election Donald Trump finally accepted his fate just before 4am Thursday after Vice President Mike Pence ended his desperate campaign to overturn the election - still not properly conceding and instead boasting it was the 'end of the greatest first term in history' in a tweet from an aide's cellphone. The VP brought the gavel down on the Trump coup at 3:41 a.m. Thursday morning and certified President-elect Joe Biden's win – despite the attempt of scores of Republicans and a violent MAGA mob to overturn it. After Pence defied his boss to settle the 2020 election once and for all, Trump finally said there would be an 'orderly transition' - a hallmark of American democracy he has repeatedly called into question - but still claimed falsely that the election was stolen despite all 50 states, a series of judges and now the U.S. Congress dismissing challenges to the result. Banned from twitter, the message was sent by Dan Scavino, his golf caddy-turned social media guru. 'Even though I totally disagree with the outcome of the election, and the facts bear me out, nevertheless there will be an orderly transition on January 20,' Trump said in a statement that aides posted on Twitter after the president's account was locked for stirring up violence. 'I have always said we would continue our fight to ensure that only legal votes were counted,' Trump said. 'While this represents the end of the greatest first term in presidential history, it's only the beginning of our fight to Make America Great Again.' Pence made the final announcement after a nearly 15-hour saga that saw rioting supporters of President Trump mob the U.S. Capitol Building in a day of carnage and shame that left four dead, saw pipe bombs, long guns and Molotov cocktails discovered in the Capitol grounds – and left America's image as the beacon of democracy reeling. The mob walked right through the halls of Congress, ransacking offices and brazenly taking photos Trump supporters attempt to ram their way through a police barricade as they raged at the president's election defeat Trump supporters marched through the Capitol Rotunda after breaching what appeared to be flimsy security - a stark contrast with the heavy-handed crackdowns that Trump ordered against Black Lives Matter protesters last summer Trash and Trump signs are seen piled beside the statue of Andrew Jackson - months after the president condemned the desecration of monuments to controversial figures in American history A protester sits in the Senate Chamber, amid an invasion that forced Congress to suspend its joint session to ratify President-elect Joe Biden's 306-232 Electoral College win over President Donald Trump The MAGA mob – which included white supremacists, Holocaust deniers and Q Anon followers - interrupted the certification of results as they smashed through police barricades, stormed into the halls of the Capitol and even sat in the Senate chamber. They looted offices, vandalized statues and confronted police as they rampaged through the Capitol, carrying Confederate flags, in hours of anarchy which shocked the world and which Biden called an 'insurrection'. As the world watched in disbelief, many were shocked at how easily the invaders had breached the hallways of American democracy - contrasting the lax security with the heavy-handed crackdowns ordered by Trump at the height of the Black Lives Matter protests last summer. Even as intruders desecrated the Capitol, Trump was said to be reluctant to deploy the National Guard, with reports saying that he 'rebuffed and resisted' the request before Pence and others finally made it happen. Lawmakers were rushed off the floor of the House and Senate – and brought back at 8pm under armed guard while outside the mob defied a curfew in D.C. The president who had whipped them into fury tweeted: 'You are special. You are loved.' One woman - 14-year Air Force veteran Ashli Babbit - was shot dead inside the building, with three others dead from unspecified 'medical emergencies' during the carnage. Washington police chief Robert Contee said 14 officers were injured, one of them pulled into a crowd and assaulted, while 52 people were arrested. Supporters of Donald Trump stormed the Capitol on Wednesday amid questions over how they breached security so easily A woman was shot in the chest on Wednesday afternoon after chaotic scenes broke out when dozens of Trump supporters breached security perimeters at the Capitol. She died at a hospital hours later, law enforcement sources said The siege brought an hours-long halt to what is usually the solemn democratic ritual of putting a final seal on the election result. When lawmakers eventually returned to their chambers, the Republicans trying to resist Biden's victory found that their numbers had dwindled, and all of their objections were voted down. The spectacle of a violent gang rampaging through the legislature trying to overturn an election result prompted outrage and anguish from America's fellow democracies, with Britain's Boris Johnson condemning the 'disgraceful scenes' and Germany's Angela Merkel saying she was 'furious and saddened' by the chaos. It was also seized on by America's authoritarian rivals to mock the state of US democracy, with Iran calling it 'fragile and vulnerable' and Russia saying that the election system 'does not meet modern democratic standards'. Former president Barack Obama described the riot as a 'moment of great dishonor and shame for our nation', while his predecessor George W. Bush said that 'this is how election results are disputed in a banana republic'. Congress' overwhelming rejection of attempts to overturn the vote and Pence's role in it will surely further enrage Trump, who wanted his VP to unilaterally overrule Biden's win - and he was left further isolated by the resignation of multiple White House aides including former press secretary Stephanie Grisham. Deputy national security adviser Matt Pottinger, social secretary Rickie Niceta and deputy press secretary Sarah Matthews also quit, with more resignations expected from aides disgusted with Trump's conduct. The president was banished from Twitter for 12 hours Wednesday due to violating the company's rules meaning he could not vent on his favorite medium. The ban was due to expire at 5am Thursday morning, but there was no immediate word on whether Trump's access had been restored. The Republican bid to overturn President-elect Joe Biden's victory ended early Thursday morning after the Senate voted 92-7 to dismiss a challenge to Pennsylvania's Electoral College vote Protesters broke windows to gain access to the Capitol as lawmakers were whisked to safety on Wednesday afternoon America's rivals gloat over Capitol chaos America's authoritarian rivals have delighted in the chaos at the Capitol, with Iran reveling in the 'fragility of Western democracy' and Venezuela mimicking the kind of criticism it usually receives from Washington. In a speech broadcast by state television, Rouhani said: 'What we saw in the United States yesterday evening and today shows above all how fragile and vulnerable Western democracy is.' In China, state-run tabloid Global Times crowed that 'bubbles of democracy and freedom have burst' in America. It also compared the chaos to the Hong Kong protests in 2019, mocking US politicians who had praised the demonstrations there. In Russia, foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said the 'archaic' US system was to blame for the rampage. 'The electoral system in the United States is archaic, it does not meed modern democratic standards, creating opportunities for numerous violations, and the American media have become an instrument of political struggle,' Zakharova said. And in Veneuzela, parodying the kind of statements that usually come from Washington, authorities expressed 'concern' about the violence while calling for the US follow a path of 'stability' and 'social justice'. Advertisement Although Trump still refuses to accept he lost the election, his early-morning statement was the first time he had fully acknowledged that he will be leaving the White House on January 20. The president has spent the last two months refusing to concede and lobbing baseless allegations of widespread voter fraud, even though his own Justice Department, federal courts and state governments have said repeatedly the vote was carried out freely and fairly. With just 13 days left of his presidency, Trump is now at war with Mitch McConnell, facing whispers of his own cabinet trying to force him out and Democrats openly discussing impeaching him again - while just a handful of senators led by Ted Cruz and Josh Hawley and the majority of the House GOP remain loyal. It was Hawley who forced Congress to sit late into the night. Biden was at 244 of the 270 Electoral College votes needed when a final challenge of Pennsylvania's count pushed lawmakers back into their respective chambers. In the Senate, Majority Leader Mitch McConnell skipped the two hours of permitted debate and went straight to a vote. The upper chamber voted 92-7 to overrule the Republicans' objection - with some Republicans changing sides to vote with the majority after the carnage of the preceding hours. 'We don't expect additional votes tonight,' McConnell said when things were done. McConnell had been against the GOP effort to challenge the Electoral College vote counts from the beginning. The House proceeded with debate and then voted 282 to 138 to overrule the challenge of Pennsylvania, with 64 Republicans voting alongside Democrats to make up the majority. Both houses have to vote in favor of a challenge for it to succeed. Republicans in the House and Senate had earlier challenged the votes in Arizona - which prompted two hours of debate, interrupted by the MAGA riot - and that objection was overwhelmingly overruled. House Republicans also tried to challenge the results in Georgia, Michigan and Nevada, but GOP senators would no longer sign on after the day's dramatic events. 'Mr. President prior to the actions and events of today we did but following the events of today it appears that some senators have withdrawn their objection,' admitted Georgia Rep. Jody Hice when challenging the results in his state.

YouTube and Facebook also followed suit in removing the posts, with Facebook and Instagram also blocking Trump from their platform for 24 hours. Snapchat blocked him on Wednesday morning, before he filmed the video. The platform said their locking of his account was indefinite. In the deleted video, he poured more fuel on the fire, claiming the election was 'stolen' and telling the rioters that he 'loved' them. Twitter said it had removed the tweets for violating their 'Civic Integrity policy'. 'As a result of the unprecedented and ongoing violent situation in Washington, D.C., we have required the removal of three @realDonaldTrump Tweets that were posted earlier today for repeated and severe violations of our Civic Integrity policy,' the social media company said. 'This means that the account of @realDonaldTrump will be locked for 12 hours following the removal of these Tweets. If the Tweets are not removed, the account will remain locked.' Advertisement At nearly 4 a.m., Rep. Louie Gohmert tried to get one more challenge through - for the state of Wisconsin - but, again, a senator had withdrawn. That spelled the end of the MAGA campaign to upend an election and Pence went on to read out the results of the Electoral College: Biden 306, Trump 232. But he managed to avoid saying 'Joe Biden is the winner' or similar words – a minor softening of the blow to Trump by the deputy who had been until this week perhaps his most devoted follower. 'To those who wreaked havoc in our capitol today, you did not win,' Pence said after lawmakers returned to their seats. 'Violence never wins. Freedom wins. And this is still the people's house.' The vice president, who chaired the special joint session as provided under the Constitution, called it a 'dark day in the history of the United States Capitol.' 'But thanks to the swift efforts of the U.S. Capitol Police, federal, state and local law enforcement, the violence was quelled. The Capitol is secured and the people's work continues,' Pence said. But astonishingly – and to the disgust of Republicans including Mitt Romney and every Democrat – some Republicans continued their doomed bid to overturn the election result. The most senior was House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, who claimed that persisting was proof that Congress was not cowed by violence. And Josh Hawley, the Missouri senator who gave a clenched fist salute to the mob before it stormed the Capitol, also refused to back down even as other senators who had planned to object abandoned the campaign. 'Americans go to bed tonight their lasting memory should not be a congress overrun by rioters. It must be a resolute Congress, conducting healthy debate,' McCarthy said. 'We may not disagree on a lot in America but tonight, we must show the world that we will respectfully, but thoroughly carry out the most basic duties of democracy, we will continue with the task that we have been sent here to do. 'We will follow the Constitution and the law and the process for hearing valid concerns about election integrity. We'll do it with respect.' Sen. Josh Hawley, who was the first senator who pledged to back a House GOP effort to object to certain states' Electoral College vote counts, refused to abandon the effort entirely Sen Ted Cruz looks on as the certification proceedings continue despite objections by him and other Republicans Sen. Hawley, who was the first senator who pledged to back a House GOP effort to object to certain states' Electoral College vote counts, refused to abandon the effort entirely. The Missouri Republican argued that the Senate floor was the appropriate place to address any election fraud concerns - as opposed to a violent riot. Pence ordered National Guard to the Capitol after Trump 'resisted' Mike Pence made the call to activate the National Guard after Trump supporters ran wild in the Capitol Building, it has been revealed. Acting Pentagon chief Christopher Miller revealed that he spoke to Pence and not Trump, the Commander in Chief, before sending in the Guard to clear out rioters. Maggie Haberman, the New York Times's White House correspondent, later revealed that Trump had 'rebuffed and resisted' attempts to call in the guard before 'White House advisers' intervened to get the move approved. Meanwhile White House National Security Advisor Robert O'Brien praised Pence's courage for certifying the state election results - a typically routine task that was thrust under the spotlight after Trump falsely suggested that Pence had the power to reject the result and declare him the victor. 'I just spoke with Vice President Pence. He is a genuinely fine and decent man. He exhibited courage today as he did at the Capitol on 9/11 as a Congressman. I am proud to serve with him,' wrote O'Brien. Advertisement 'Violence is not how you achieve change,' Hawley said. 'And that's why I submit to my colleagues that what we're doing here tonight is actually very important. Because of those who have concerns about the integrity of our elections ... this is the appropriate means, this is the lawful place, where those objections and concerns should be heard.' He said he hoped the Senate could address concerns 'peacefully, without violence, without attacks, without bullets.' Hawley also used the Arizona debate to complain about Pennsylvania, correctly foreseeing that there would be no full debate about that state's results. 'And so Mr. President let me just say now, that briefly, in lieu of speaking about it later, a word about Pennsylvania - this is a state that I have been focused on, objected to,' Hawley said. He then went on to complain that the state set-up 'universal mail-in balloting.' 'And did it irregardless of what the Pennsylvania Constitution says,' Hawley said, using the improper word for regardless. The senator then objected to how the Pennsylvania Supreme Court made its decision, holding up the law that allowed for enhanced mail-in voting during the coronavirus pandemic. Directly after Hawley spoke, Sen. Mitt Romney applauded those senators, like Loeffler and Lankford, who had abandoned Hawley and the 'dirty dozen's' effort. 'The best way we can show respect to the voters who are upset is by telling them the truth,' Romney implored. And the truth, he said, was 'President-Elect Biden won the election. President Trump lost.' 'I've had that experience myself, it's no fun,' Romney said, a reference to losing the 2012 presidential election to Democratic President Barack Obama. As he concluded, Romney was given a standing ovation by some senators – but not by Hawley, who was sitting directly in front of him. McConnell, who earlier chastised members of his own party who planned to file objections to the Electoral College vote count, proclaimed, 'The United States Senate will not be intimidated.'

Lamb first read from the speech he had planned to give pre-riot, including that Allegheny County's vote-counting operation had '31 video cameras!' he said, raising his voice. 'These objections don't deserve an ounce of respect. Not an ounce,' he then said. 'A woman died out there tonight and you're making these objections,' Lamb went on. 'Let's be clear about what happened in this chamber today: invaders came in for the first time since the War of 1812.' Lamb nodded over in the direction of a group of his Republican colleagues. 'We know that that attack today, it didn't materialize out of nowhere. It was inspired by lies, the same lies you're hearing in this room tonight, and the members who are repeating those lies should be ashamed of themselves,' Lamb said. 'Their constituents should be ashamed of them.' Rep. Morgan Griffith shouted to have Lamb's comments struck from the record. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi gaveled his request down, later explaining that he wasn't quick enough, saying it needed to happen 'exactly when the words are spoken.' Nearby, a scuffle among lawmakers nearly broke out involving Rep. Andy Harris, a Maryland Republican, and Rep. Colin Allred, a Texas Democrat, according to Capitol Hill reporters. Allred is a former professional football player. As 2 am neared, Rep Conor Lamb (pictured), a Pennsylvania Democrat who represents the Pittsburgh area, unloaded on the Republicans who objected to the vote from his state Speaker Nancy Pelosi reopened the House of Representatives Wednesday night with a vow to stay as long as it takes to certify the election and Joe Biden's victory. 'Congress has returned to the Capitol,' she said seven hours after the chamber was closed because rioters were trying to breach its doors. 'We always knew that this responsibility would take us into the night, and will stay as long as it takes. Our purpose will be accomplished. We must and we will show to the country.' 'We know that we're in difficult times, but little could we have imagined the assault, that was made on our democracy,' she said in reference to the pro-Trump insurgents who tried to stop the Joint Session. She said it was the duty of lawmakers to show the world 'the peaceful transfer of power from one president to the next.' Shortly before all House members were evacuated around 2.30pm, Capitol Police approached Pelosi, who was presiding over the chamber from the speaker's rostrum, telling her she had to leave. Pelosi didn't make a fuss and turned over her duties to House Rules Chairman Jim McGovern. He told reporters on Capitol Hill that she whispered 'thank you' and handed him the gavel as she was led away. Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., presides over the House Chamber after they reconvened Some Republican senators backed down from the original plan to object after pro-Trump insurgents rushed the Capitol.

We will follow the Constitution and the law and the process for hearing valid concerns about election integrity. We'll do it with respect,' he said on the House floor after the chamber reopened. But he also condemned the rioters. 'We saw the worst of America this afternoon,' he said. McCarthy also warned lawmakers to think twice about what they post on social media. Posts by Republicans, including President Trump, falsely stating the election was rigged and fraudulent were believed to have contributed to inciting the mob that ran sacked the Capitol. 'We also should think for a moment about what do we put on social media,' he said. 'Just because you have a personal opinion different than mine, you have a right to say it, but nobody has a right to become a mob. And we all should stand united to condemning them all together.' Pence's condemnation was followed by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, with Schumer - a New York Democrat - placing the blame squarely on Trump. 'Today's events would certainly not have happened without him,' Schumer said. McConnell, who earlier chastised members of his own party who planned to file objections to the Electoral College vote count, proclaimed, 'The United States Senate will not be intimidated.' 'Will not be kept out of its chamber by thugs, mobs or threats. We will not bend for lawlessness or intimidation,' the Kentucky Republican said. He said senators would discharge their Constitutional duty - to certify the results of the presidential race. 'And we're going to do it tonight,' McConnell said. The Kentucky Republican proclaimed, 'Criminal behavior will never dominate the United States Congress.' Schumer followed, admitting that he didn't quite have the words to describe what happened Wednesday on Capitol Hill. 'I have never lived through, or even imagined the experience like the one we have just witnessed in this Capitol,' he said. 'This temple to democracy was desecrated, its windows smashed, our offices vandalized.' Sen.

'We mourn her and feel for her friends and family,' Schumer said. 'This will be a stain on our country not so easily washed away,' he added. And the soon-to-be majority leader, after Democrats were successful in both Georgia Senate run-off races, pointed a finger at Trump, calling the day's events the 'final terrible indelible legacy of the 45th president of the United States.' 'Undoubtedly our worst,' Schumer argued. 'Today's events did not happen spontaneously, the president who promoted conspiracy theories, who motivated these thugs, a president who exhorted them to come to our United States capitol, egged them on, who hardly ever discourages violence. This president deals a great deal of the blame,' Schumer said. He said that those responsible for overtaking the capitol could not be called 'protesters.' 'These were rioters and insurrectionist goons and thugs, domestic terrorists,' Schumer said. 'They do not represent America Senate Majority Leader spoke immediately after Pence to declare that the chamber would not be intimidated by 'thugs.' McConnell found himself denouncing Trump's bid to overturn the election for the second time in a day, after earlier delivering a strong speech blasting the effort by members of his own caucus seeking to throw out electors in states that went for Joe Biden. Wednesday night, after Trump supporters breached hallways that McConnell has walked for decades on 'unhinged' invaders – without mentioning that it was President Trump who encouraged his supporters to march to the Capitol. Nevertheless, he eviscerated the Trump backers who ran wild inside the chamber. 'The United States Senate will not be intimidated. We will not be kept out of this chamber by thugs, mobs or threats. We will not bow to lawlessness or intimidation,' vowed McConnell. 'We are back at our post. We will discharge our duty under the Constitution and for our nation. And we're going to do it tonight,' said McConnell. The Kentucky Republican proclaimed, 'Criminal behavior will never dominate the United States Congress.'

Lindsey Graham, one of the president's top allies in the Senate, threw water on the objectors' efforts recalling how in 1876 three southern states - South Carolina, Louisiana and Florida - sent two slates of electors to Congress, in a bid to end Reconstruction after the Civil War His words were both strengthened and undercut by his close association with Trump's tenure: McConnell's wife Elaine Chao serves as Trump's Transportation secretary. McConnell spent weeks without denouncing Trump's unsubstantiated claims the election was rigged. And it was in partnership with Trump that he achieved his life's goal of stacking the judiciary with conservative jurists. He spoke with contempt towards the mob who invaded the Capitol, saying the country had 'faced down much greater threats than the unhinged crowd we saw today.' Among Republicans bailing on the plan to contest the results was Sen. James Lankford of Oklahoma, known as an institutionalist before he signed onto the effort by Sen. Ted Cruz 'We've never been deterred before and we'll be not deterred today. They tried to disrupt our democracy. They failed,' he intoned. He called it a 'failed insurrection' and said it 'only underscores how crucial the task before us is for our republic.' 'Now we're going to finish exactly what we started,' said McConnell. 'We'll complete the process in the right way: by the book.' He said the Senate would follow its precedents and laws and Constitution 'to the letter.' 'And we will certify the winner of the 2020 presidential election,' he said forcefully. 'Criminal behavior will never dominate the United States Congress. This institution is resilient. Our democratic republic is strong. The American people deserve nothing less,' he said. Among Republicans bailing on the plan to contest the results was Sen. James Lankford of Oklahoma, known as an institutionalist before he signed onto the effort by Sen. Ted Cruz. 'Why in god's name would someone think attacking law enforcement occupying United States Capitol is the best way to show that you're right? Why would you do that?' he asked. 'Rioters and thugs don't run the capitol we're the United States of America. We disagree on a lot of things and we have a lot of spirited debate in this room. But we talk it out and we honor each other. Lankford had been on the Senate floor defending the opposition to votes in states Biden won when officials evacuated the chamber and locked down the Capitol. 'I was literally interrupted mid-sentence speaking here. Because we're all aware of what was happening right outside this room,' he said, praising law enforcement who protected the Capitol. Georgia Republican Sen. Kelly Loeffler, who lost her race in the early hours Wednesday to Democratic Rev. Raphael Warnock, announced that she would no longer be filing objections to Electoral College votes He quickly bowed to the new reality. 'Obviously the commission that we've asked for is not going to happen at this point and I understand that and we're headed towards tonight towards the certification of Joe Biden to be the president of the United States,' he said. Cruz and his compatriots wanted a special commission to investigate electoral fraud claims tossed out of courts over a ten-day period. 'And we will work together in this body to be able to send peaceful example in the days ahead,' he concluded. Sen. Lindsey Graham, one of the president's top allies in the Senate, threw water on the objectors' efforts recalling how in 1876 three southern states - South Carolina, Louisiana and Florida - sent two slates of electors to Congress, in a bid to end Reconstruction after the Civil War.

The South Carolina Republican also said that a forming a commission to look into fraud wouldn't change minds. 'Having a commission chosen by Nancy Pelosi, Mitch McConnell and John Roberts is not going to get you to where you want to go, it ain't going to work,' Graham said. 'It's not going to do any good, it's going to delay and it gives credibility to a dark chapter of our history.' Graham maintained Trump was a 'consequential president.' 'But today ... all I can say is count me out, enough is enough, I've tried to be helpful.' Graham praised Pence, telling him: 'what they're asking you to do, you won't do, because you can't.' Trump has pressured Pence to choose between Electoral College votes and 'alternate' slates of electors, which the vice president doesn't have the power to do. Graham also mentioned how he had traveled the world with Biden, when they served together in the Senate. 'I prayed he would lose,' Graham said. 'He's the legitimate president of the United States.' Georgia Republican Sen. Kelly Loeffler, who lost her race in the early hours Wednesday to Democratic Rev. Raphael Warnock, announced that she would no longer be filing objections to Electoral College votes. 'When I arrived in Washington this morning, I fully intended to object to the certification of the electoral votes,' she said. 'However, the events that have transpired today have forced me to reconsider and I cannot now, in good conscience, object.' Sen. Steve Daines, a Montana Republican, also announced that he no longer supported senators filing objections. The newly minted Sen. Roger Marshall, a Kansas Republican, who had joined Sen. Ted Cruz's 'dirty dozen,' seemed to still back the effort in his debut floor speech. 'We must restore faith and confidence in one of our republic's most hallowed and patriotic duties: voting,' Marshall said. Marshall said he backed the creation of an electoral commission to give states to constructive suggestions' going forward, due to the 'jarring irregularities' he claimed took place in the 2020 race. It's unclear if Marshall would back additional challenges in states going forward, as the Senate's discussion was only focused on Electoral College votes in Arizona. Police spray tear gas at a protester who picked up a police barricade in an effort to get closer to the Capitol Members of congress run for cover as protesters try to enter the House Chamber A protester walks through Congress carrying Nancy Pelosi's lectern after storming the Capitol Republican Congressman Thomas Reed announced he is against the GOP objections to the certification, earning a round of applause from Democrats. Reed walked to the Democratic side of the House to speak about his opposition, citing the day's violence in the Capitol as the reason. 'We settle our differences through elections,' he said, denouncing the 'mob rule' that took place earlier in the afternoon. 'What we see tonight in this body shall be what we do in America. And that is to transfer power in a peaceful way,' he said as Democrats gave him a standing ovation. Republican Congressman Matt Gaetz, a top Trump ally on Capitol Hill, pushed a conspiracy theory that some of the mob that raided the Capitol were members of Antifa, who are opposed to fascism and other forms of extreme right-wing ideology. President Trump has tried to label Antifa as a terrorist group but they a political philosophy. There is no evidence they were involved in Wednesday's insurrection. Gaetz cited the conservative newspaper The Washington Times when he spoke on the House floor to defend Republican objections to the electoral college votes in some states won by Biden. 'The Washington Times has just reported, some pretty compelling evidence from a facial recognition company, showing that some of the people who breached the Capitol today, were not Trump supporters, they were masquerading as Trump supporters, and in fact, we're members of the violet terrorist group Antifa,' he said as Democrats loudly booed him. Gaetz, a frequent guest at Trump's Florida residence Mar-a-Lago, also defended the president, who was criticized by many, including members of the Republican Party, for his lackluster response to the riots. 'Another important point for the country is that this morning President Trump explicitly called for demonstrations and protests to be peaceful,' Gaetz said. Trump, in tweets, did say the protesters should be peaceful but he didn't call for them to stand down and leave the Capitol. Democrats booed Gaetz as he spoke, which he acknowledged: 'You can moan and groan but he was far more explicit about his calls for peace than some of the BLM and left wing writers were this summer, when we saw violence sweep across this nation.' Gaetz also got in a dig at liberal Democrats, who have called to defund the police. 'I'm sure glad that at least for one day, I didn't hear my Democratic colleagues calling to defund the police,' he said as his Republican colleagues cheered. Members of Congress are pictured rushing to evacuate the House Chamber as protesters attempted to enter National Guard members line up on the Capitol grounds as protesters continue occupying the area after curfew The mostly maskless crowd flooded the halls of the Capitol with little resistance from Capitol Police The DC National Guard was deployed to the streets to help enforce a 6pm curfew Trump - after remaining silent for much of the afternoon - posted a video telling his 'very special' supporters inside the Capitol that he loves them and understands their pain but urged them 'to go home'. He had initially encouraged his supporters to march to the Capitol after a rally earlier in the afternoon before asking them only to remain peaceful when violence broke out. The Capitol was briefly secured before being placed on lockdown again at around 6.45pm due to an 'internal security threat' after an officer was reportedly found unconscious. Anyone inside a building at the Capitol complex was instructed to take cover in an office with doors locked. But just before 8pm lawmakers who had been whisked to safety when the siege kicked off began arriving back at the Capitol to resume the Joint Session to certify the Electoral College count of the presidential election. The lawmakers were seen flanked by armed guards as they made their way into the Capitol. A spokesperson for Vice President Mike Pence, who is residing over the Joint Session, said he was already in the building because he'd never left. As the protesters broke down police barricades and stormed into the Capitol, lawmakers cowering inside the House Chamber were told to put on gas masks as tear gas was fired in the Rotunda. Officers at the front door of the chamber had their guns drawn at a protester trying to break down the door. The Capitol was placed on lockdown again at around 6.45pm due to an 'internal security threat' after an officers was reportedly found unconscious. Anyone inside a building at the Capitol complex was instructed to take cover in an office with doors locked For those fleeing, it was a race against time: Protesters were getting in as quickly as members of Congress could get out. One protester occupied the Senate dais and yelled: 'Trump won that election'. Some protesters even occupied Pelosi's office, sitting mockingly at a desk. The chaotic scenes unfolded soon after Trump addressed thousands of his supporters and urged them to march to the Capitol. The protesters organized via far-right social media sites, including Gab and Parler, telling each other the best routes to avoid police on their way to the Capitol. After protesters started clashing with law enforcement, Trump tweeted to his supporters to 'stay peaceful'. 'Please support our Capitol Police and Law Enforcement. They are truly on the side of our Country. Stay peaceful!' the president wrote. As the violence escalated, Trump tweeted: 'I am asking for everyone at the U.S. Capitol to remain peaceful. No violence! Remember, WE are the Party of Law & Order - respect the Law and our great men and women in Blue. Thank you!' He did not initially tell the protesters to leave. Biden on Wednesday evening called for the restoration of 'simple decency' after the mob delayed Congress from certifying the results of November's election. 'At this hour, our democracy is under unprecedented assault unlike anything we've seen in modern times,' Biden said. He called it 'an assault on the rule of law like few times we have ever seen it.' 'I call on this mob to pull back and allow democracy to go forward. In an address that took less than 10 minutes and was televised against a split screen of the still-occupied Capitol building, Biden attempted to project calm and to say that a deeply divided country can still come together - while also expressing outrage. He stopped short of accusing Trump of treason but said the events 'bordered on sedition'. 'At their best, the words of a president can inspire,' Biden added. 'At their worst they can incite.' Minutes after Biden's address, Trump posted his own video telling his mob of supporters that he 'loves' them, but to 'go home'. In the same breath he also continued to peddle his baseless claims that the 'election was stolen'. 'There's never been a time like this where such a thing happened where they could take it away from all of us - from me, from you, from our country. This was a fraudulent election, but we can't play into the hands of these people,' he said. 'We have to have peace. So, go home. We love you. You're very special. You've seen what happens. You see the way others are treated that are so bad and so evil. I know how you feel. But go home and go home in peace.' The video was later removed by Facebook, Twitter and YouTube because it violated their policies. The president then posted another tweet reiterating his false claim that the election was stolen and encouraging supporters to 'remember this day'. The tweet was perceived by some as an attempt to rile up the Capitol crowds. 'These are the things and events that happen when a sacred landslide election victory is so unceremoniously & viciously stripped away from great patriots who have been badly & unfairly treated for so long,' he tweeted. 'Go home with love & in peace. Remember this day forever!' Twitter removed the tweet for violating its rules. Mob smashes through police barriers and wall of tear gas to stop Biden's victory being certified: How Trump protesters turned Congress into a battlefield Capitol Police used tear gas as hundreds of people were seen climbing the marble steps outside the building. They banged on the locked doors of the Capitol and smashed the glass in the doors. Demonstrators fought with police and then forced their way into the building. Asked how so many people were able to get in, officials said they were focusing their attention on keeping lawmakers inside safe. 'We love you. You are special.' Trump finally addresses Capitol mob HE unleashed and says 'Go home now. We have to have peace' Donald Trump told his mob of supporters that he 'loves' them, but to 'go home' after they rampaged past police barriers to storm the U.S. Capitol. But despite calling for his supporters to stand down, he continued to peddle the baseless claims that the 'election was stolen' in a video posted to Twitter Wednesday afternoon. 'There's never been a time like this where such a thing happened where they could take it away from all of us - from me, from you, from our country. This was a fraudulent election, but we can't play into the hands of these people. 'We have to have peace. So, go home. We love you. You're very special. You've seen what happens. You see the way others are treated that are so bad and so evil. I know how you feel. But go home and go home in peace,' Trump said. It came hours after Trump stirred them into a frenzy at his 'Stop the Steal' rally, telling them to march on the U.S. Capitol. The president still has not conceded the election and earlier Wednesday addressed a crowd at the ellipse spouting conspiracy theories that he still had a path to win - if Vice President Mike Pence did his bidding, as well as if GOP lawmakers revolted. Pence did no such thing. The chaotic scenes unfolded soon after Trump addressed thousands of protesters and urged his supporters to march to the Capitol. After protesters started clashing with law enforcement following the Capitol breach, Trump tweeted to his supporters to 'stay peaceful' Advertisement One video posted on TikTok appeared to show a group of about four officers standing by as protesters pushed past a barricade near the Capitol building. The officers did not appear to try to block the stampede, instead walking with it toward the building. One protester jumped up on the dais, where the president of the Senate presides, and yelled: 'Trump won that election.' Several dozen protesters roamed the halls of the Capitol, yelling: 'Where are they?' Tear gas was being used by Capitol Police as protesters filled both the House and Senate side of the Capitol. Another protester in the Senate yelled: 'Where's Pence, show yourself!' The chaos caused the Capitol to go on lockdown and disrupted the certification of the electoral college vote that would cement Biden's victory. Mayor Bowser declared a 6pm curfew for the city and said multiple law enforcement agencies would be patrolling the streets. Just before the curfew went into effect she was asked multiple by times by CNN if curfew violators would be arrested, but she refused to give a clear answer. Bowser said 'many' arrests had already been made but did not have a specific number. As footage started coming out of Capitol Hill being breached by angry Trump supporters, Donald Trump Jr tried to quell the outburst with a tweet – that was critical of Democrats and liberals. 'This is wrong and not who we are. Be peaceful and use your 1st Amendment rights, but don't start acting like the other side,' Trump Jr. wrote. 'We have a country to save and this doesn't help anyone.' Meanwhile, the president continued to direct his rage at Pence, who earlier announced he would not single-handedly overturn the election results from his position of the chair. 'Mike Pence didn't have the courage to do what should have been done to protect our Country and our Constitution, giving States a chance to certify a corrected set of facts, not the fraudulent or inaccurate ones which they were asked to previously certify. USA demands the truth!' the president tweeted. The extraordinary breech was a departure from security mishaps of the past. Protesters have routinely disrupted televised hearings while in progress and even events inside the House chamber. But trained Capitol Police are usually able to arrest disruptors and remove them immediately. Often formal charges are never filed. But in Wednesday's storming of the building, dozens of people made it by armed police officers and entered the building without going through any security set up to keep out those with weapons or dangerous items. There were occasions after September 11th when the building was placed on lockdown and people were ordered to leave, but this usually happened when suspicious packages were discovered. When the building is open, as it was before the pandemic, members of the general public are not allowed to walk unescorted on the second floor where lawmakers enter and exit the legislative chambers. The protesters were aided by scaffolding constructed for the upcoming inauguration. In another tense piece of video from inside, Rep. Michael McCaul (R-Texas) tweeted video of protesters repeatedly rushing Capitol Police officers in the crypt, in the ground floor part of the building under the rotunda. 'I like many people voted for President Trump in the 2020 election and hoped for a different result,' McCaul wrote. 'But violence and destruction is not the way to express your grievances. This is disgraceful and has to end.'

Protesters swarmed into the Kansas statehouse in Topeka and gathered inside the first floor of the Capitol Rotunda, though the rally remained orderly, television station KSNT reported. There were no immediate reports of violence, despite the flurry of demonstrations by pro-Trump demonstrators echoing his baseless claims that he was robbed of a re-election victory due to voter fraud. Denver Mayor Michael Hancock said on Twitter that he had instructed city agencies to close municipal offices early in Colorado's state capital 'out of an abundance of caution' after about 700 demonstrators gathered at the statehouse downtown. 'My hope is that this situation will be resolved quickly. Pray for our nation,' he tweeted. A major courthouse complex and two other government buildings in Atlanta, the capital of Georgia, were also ordered closed due to protests near the statehouse. Among those whose daily routines were altered were aides to Georgia's secretary of state, Brad Raffensperger, the Republican election official pressured by Trump in a weekend telephone call to 'find' enough additional votes for the president to overturn the November victory of President-elect Joe Biden, due to take office in two weeks. Raffensperger's spokesman, Walter Jones, said staff left their offices after lunch out of an abundance of caution because of protests. He said Raffensperger was not in the office at the time. In Salt Lake City, Dana Jones, director of the state Capitol Preservation Board, said she had asked building staff to work from home on Wednesday afternoon on the advice of the Utah Highway Patrol and public safety commissioner, according to the Salt Lake Tribune. The precaution was taken, the newspaper said, in response to a crowd of about 250 pro-Trump demonstrators who posted signs on the Capitol building that read: 'Stop the steal!' and 'Trump won!' A Utah state police spokesman said security had been beefed up at the Capitol, though he said protesters there were 'very peaceful,' the Tribune reported. It said one of its photographers was pepper-sprayed by individuals upset that he was documenting their protest. Several hundred Trump supporters also staged a 'Stop the Steal' rally at the Arizona state Capitol in Phoenix, cheering and jeering while exhibiting a guillotine.

He threatened Pence saying 'I'm not hearing good stories' and telling him to have 'courage' to strike down swing states' votes – a move which would defy the constitution. But minutes before arriving on Capitol Hill to preside over the joint session of Congress to certify the election's outcome, Pence bluntly told lawmakers that he would refuse to obey Trump's orders. Pence sent a letter to the 535 senators and representatives on Capitol Hill ahead of his presiding over the Joint Session that will certify Joe Biden's victory. In it, he outlined his belief in his role in the proceedings, which he notes is 'ceremonial' and adds that it doesn't include the authority to 'determine which electoral votes should be counted and which should not.' Trump has tried to put the blame on Pence for his expected loss on Wednesday but the president also lacks support among the majority of senators in his own party, which dooms his efforts for a congressional overthrow of the results. Pence acknowledged Trump's allegations the election was rigged, of which there has been no proof and no court has upheld, in a likely peace offering to the president. 'I share the concerns of millions of Americans about the integrity of this election,' he wrote. In a letter Wednesday, Pence said, 'It is my considered judgment that my oath to support and defend the Constitution contains me from claiming unilateral authority to determine which electoral votes should be counted and which should not' But he noted as vice president he does not have the power from the constitution to decide which electoral votes are counted and which are not. 'As a student of history who loves the constitution and reveres its Framers, I do not believe that the Founds of our country intended to invest the vice president with unilateral authority to decide which electoral votes should be counted during the Joint Session of Congress and no Vice President in American history has ever asserted such authority,' Pence noted. He added vice presidents in the past have conducted 'the proceedings in an orderly manner even where the count resulted in the defeat of their party or their own candidacy'. 'It is my considered judgement that my oath to support and defend the Constitution constrains me from claiming unilateral authority to determine which electoral votes should be counted and which should not,' he said. He concluded his letter with a prayer to God: 'When the Joint Session of Congress convenes today, I will do my duty to see to it that we open the certificates of electors of the several states, we hear objections raised by Senators and Representatives, and we count the votes of the Electoral College for President and Vice President in a manner consistent with our Constitution, laws and history. So Help Me God.' Pelosi reminded lawmakers that only 11 members from each party were allowed on the House floor at a time due to social distancing. She called out Republicans for having too many lawmakers on the floor 'The law says voter registration ends on October 5. Democrats said we don't care what the law says they went to a court got an Obama appointed judge to extend in 18 days,' Republican Congressman Jim Jordan, a top Trump ally on Capitol Hill, complained of Arizona Speaker Nancy Pelosi presided over the debate. She sanitized the gavel before she used it. Pence had used it when he presided over the Joint Session REPUBLICANS OBJECT TO ARIZONA'S VOTES When the certification process got underway shortly after 1pm Wednesday, lawmakers got through Alabama and Alaska, two states that went for Trump, before the first objection was filed for Arizona. Rep. Paul Gosar, an Arizona Republican, objected to his state's Electoral College votes going to Biden and Harris. He confirmed that his objection had been signed on to by a US senator. Democrats in the chamber audibly groaned while droves of Republicans in the chamber stood up and clapped. The move forced Pence to order the houses out of Joint Session. The senators in the House chamber started moving back toward their side of the US Capitol. On the House side, during their debate on the Arizona objection, Republican lawmakers used their time to complain about the treatment of the president, particularly the impeachment process and special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation. They did not offer any proof of voter fraud but complained that voter laws were changed ahead of the November contest, which is not illegal. 'The law says voter registration ends on October 5. Democrats said we don't care what the law says they went to a court got an Obama appointed judge to extend in 18 days,' Republican Congressman Jim Jordan, a top Trump ally on Capitol Hill, complained of Arizona. Many states had their voter registration deadlines extended because of the coronavirus pandemic – the extension applied to voters of both parties. Other states extended the time period allowing mail-in voting, again because of the pandemic and it applied to all voters. Democrats argued the election was legally conducted. 'Under some of the most trying circumstances in our history, our fellow citizens conducted a free and fair election vindicating our founders belief once again that we were capable of self government, and a peaceful transition of power,' Democratic Congressman Adam Schiff said. Speaker Pelosi presided over the debate. She sanitized the gavel before she used it. Pence had used it when he presided over the Joint Session. Pelosi also reminded lawmakers that only 11 members from each party were allowed on the House floor at a time due to social distancing. She called out Republicans for having too many lawmakers on the floor. MITCH MCCONNELL SLAMS ELECTION 'CONSPIRACY THEORIES' Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell shamed Trump and his own Republican colleagues for mounting challenges to the Electoral College vote count, saying their doing so could lead to a 'death spiral' of American democracy – and pointing out there's no real evidence of widespread voter fraud. 'We're debating a step that has never been taken in American history, whether Congress should overrule the voters and overturn a presidential election,' he said on the Senate floor, after Rep Gosar and a batch of GOP senators, including Sen Ted Cruz, objected to Arizona's Electoral College vote count. McConnell ridiculed Trump's claims of widespread voter fraud in a five-minute speech, which will be one of his last as majority leader, and which he said was about the most important vote of his career. 'The assertions range from specific, local allegations to Constitutional arguments to sweeping conspiracy theories,' McConnell said. He reminded senators that he was supportive of Trump using the country's legal system, which handed the president and his team loss after loss. And pointed out that these cases were heard by some of the 'all-star judges whom the president himself nominated' - including on the U.S. Supreme Court. McConnell said that every election is plagued by some instances of vote irregularity. 'And of course that's unacceptable,' he said. McConnell ridiculed President Donald Trump's claims of widespread voter fraud in a five-minute speech which will be one of his last as majority leader – and which he said was about the most important vote of his career The top Senate Republican also said he supported 'strong state-led voting reforms,' adding that he didn't wan tto see 'last year's bizarre pandemic procedures' - like mail-in ballots that gave Democrats an edge - 'become the new norm.' 'But my colleagues nothing before us proves illegality anywhere near the massive scale, the massive scale that would have tipped the entire election,' McConnell argued. 'Nor can public doubt alone justify a radical break, when the doubt itself was incited without any evidence.' He pointed out that the Constitution gives Congress a 'limited role.' 'We simply can't declare ourselves a national board of elections on steroids,' McConnell said. Twisting the knife into Trump, McConnell also pointed out that the race between Biden and Trump 'was not unusually close.' 'The Electoral College margin was almost identical to what it was in 2016,' McConnell pointed out. 'If this election were overturned by mere allegations from the losing side our democracy would enter a death spiral,' McConnell warned. 'We'd never see a whole nation accept an election again.' 'Every four years there would be a scramble for power at any cost,' he added. TRUMP'S STOP THE STEAL RALLY This came after Trump excoriated 'weak' Republicans and demanded fealty from Pence to a rally crowd near the White House on Wednesday, where he demanded Pence and Congress overturn the election results that lead to his defeat. In an extraordinary speech, Trump once again called his election 'rigged' just minutes before a joint meeting of Congress was to begin counting the certified electoral votes that have him losing to Joe Biden. Trump referred to votes that came in after 10pm election night – which consisted of in-person and mail-in ballots and denied him the lead he said he and his pollsters anticipated – as 'these explosions of bullsh*t.' Members of the crowd immediately chanted 'Bullshi*t!' in response. 'Our election was over at 10 in the evening,' Trump said. Trump mocked his party's 2012 Republican presidential nominee, now-Sen. Mitt Romney, for conceded his own race back then. 'We will never concede. It doesn't happen,' he said – although losing candidates have conceded for generations. 'There's never been anything like this. It's a pure theft.' Trump's comments amounted to a declaration of war on elements of his party, after his lawyer Rudy Giuliani demanded 'trial by combat' against opponents of his claims of election fraud. Trump spoke to a crowd of several thousand – but referred to them as consisting of 'hundreds of thousands' of supporters fathered on a lawn south of the White House that doesn't hold that many. He said his election was 'stolen by the fake news media. That's what they've done and that's what they're doing.' Trump addressed his thousands of his supporters near the White House Wednesday at his 'Save America' rally and declared war on his own party, calling Republicans who opposed him 'weak' Hours after a humiliating defeat in one Georgia Senate race and the prospect of losing another, Team Trump showed no sign of conceding A stand was being erected at the base of the US Capitol as a pro-Trump supporter holds a flag, hours before Congress meets to certify the electoral college vote for Biden A crowd of Trump supporters started gathering outside of the White House for a rally on Wednesday He urged his supporters to march down to the Congress, which was to commence the count at 1 pm. 'We're going to walk down to the Capitol and we're going to cheer on our brave senators and congressmen and women,' he said, speaking from behind a pane of bullet-proof material. He turned up the heat on Pence, a potential 2024 contender who will preside over the count. His role is set in the Constitution and the Electoral Count Act, and is largely ceremonial. 'Mike Pence is going to have to come through for us, and if he doesn't that will be a sad day for our country because you're sworn to uphold our Constitution,' he said. Trump acknowledged that he has tried to pressure Pence into rejecting votes from states he lost, quoting from a conversation he has denied happened. 'All Vice President Pence has to do is send it back to the states to re-certify and we become president and you are the happiest people,' he told his fans, who cheered 'Stop the Steal!' at times. 'I said Mike, that doesn't take courage. What takes courage is to do nothing. That takes courage. And then we're stuck with a president who lost the election by a lot and we have to live with that,' he said of Biden.""]"

Curtis Coulson, who is accused of waving a stick 'in a threatening manner' towards a woman during a riot in Sheffield, wiped away tears throughout his 20 minute-long appearance in court today. The 30-year-old, who denied one charge of affray, became even more upset when he was refused bail and remanded in custody at Sheffield Magistrates Court. He was among at least 25 riot suspects to be hauled before court today. Leanne Hodgson, 43, admitted violent disorder after pushing a wheelie bin at police in Sunderland. She was also remanded in custody, as her lawyer told magistrates that she had an 'alcohol problem' and suffered from poor mental health.

It comes as a disturbing post emerged on Telegram channel Southport Wake Up which called for attacks against 39 immigration centres. The post, seen by The Times, read: 'Wednesday night lads. They wont [sic] stop coming until you tell them... No more immigration. 8pm.' Three men appeared in court this morning in connection with violent disorder that broke out yesterday in Bolton, where around 300 masked Muslim people shouting 'Allahu Akbar' – or 'God is greatest' – charged towards anti-immigration marchers, with rival groups throwing missiles at each another. Hamza Mohammed, 23, a salesman from Bolton, was charged with possessing fireworks, while Daniel Robinson, 37, of admitted possessing a hammer.

'Cobra was attended by the Prime Minister, the Deputy Prime Minister, Home Secretary, Justice Secretary, DSIT (Department for Science, Innovation and Technology) Secretary, Attorney General, Chief Secretary and leaders from police, prison service, NCA (National Crime Agency) and other senior officials. 'The PM paid tribute to the hard work of police officers over the past week and sent best wishes to those who have been injured protecting our streets. 'There have been hundreds of arrests and people are already being charged, and police will continue to update on the specifics in relation to progress or arrests and charging. 'The police are continuing to deploy additional resource around the country at strategic locations where necessary.' The recent disorder echoes the 2011 riots, which began following the shooting by police of Mark Duggan in Tottenham before breaking out into riots across London and then other cities in England. Looter Gordon Thompson received one of the strongest sentences in the aftermath of the riots, with the thug locked up for 11-and-a-half years for setting fire to House of Reeves, a family run furniture store in Croydon. Steven Mailen, 54, appeared in court over unrest in Hartlepool Ryan Sheers, 28, wept during the hearing over rioting in Hartlepool Sheers (left) and Mailen (right) seen dancing and shouting at police officers during the disorder Spellow Library was torched and looted, with pictures showing the burnt-out interior Scenes after last night's riots in Middlesbrough saw burnt out cars and debris scattered across the town Fires in Middlesbrough caused serious damage to homes and businesses over the weekend Racist graffiti was pictured in Tamworth this morning with phrases 'Get out England' and 'F*** P****' Hundreds of police officers have been injured in clashes with thugs, as far-right activists led the way in attacking police officers, mosques and hotels thought to house asylum seekers this week Anti-Muslim chants were heard and in some areas of the country rioters were filmed stopping cars and interrogating drivers about whether they were 'white and English' Far-right protests spread across England and into Northern Ireland after the deaths of three little girls, fuelled by false information on social media (Pictured: Attendees confront police in Belfast) Posts in a Telegram channel called Southport Wake Up listed a series of immigration lawyers and advice centres and urged its 12,000 members to attack them at 8pm on Wednesday Shadow Home Secretary James Cleverly said this week's violence is 'clearly far-right extremism' that is 'driven by racism' and said he would have called a Cobra meeting sooner. Riots have broken out across the country fuelled by misinformation on social media since three little girls were stabbed to death at a Taylor Swift themed dance class in Southport on Monday. Hundreds of police officers have been injured in clashes with thugs, as far-right activists led the way in attacking police officers, mosques and hotels thought to house asylum seekers this week. Anti-Muslim chants were heard and in some areas of the country rioters were filmed stopping cars and interrogating drivers about whether they were 'white and English'. Communities are now coming together to begin the massive clean-up operation in areas including Rotherham, Middlesbrough and Tamworth. The Home Office announced yesterday that mosques would be offered greater protection under a new 'rapid response process' designed to quickly tackle the threat of further attacks on places of worship. A large crowd gathered outside a mosque in Middlesbrough on Sunday night and others have also been targeted. On Saturday night Spellow Lane Library in Liverpool was torched while in Sunderland local travel agents Hays Travel, known for its commitment to raising money for charity, had its storefront smashed. In Rotherham, anti-immigration rioters smashed the windows of the Holiday Inn Express before starting fires in an apparent attempt to set the building alight while dozens of people were inside it. At least 10 officers were injured there, including one who was knocked unconscious, South Yorkshire Police confirmed later, saying one person had already been arrested and others involved should 'expect us to be at their doors very soon'. Masked men hurled lengths of wood, chairs and bottles, and sprayed fire extinguishers at officers outside after some 700 people gathered. Racist chants were heard at multiple riots across the country, with images appearing to show some members of the mobs performing Nazi salutes. A similar incident played out at a Holiday Inn hotel in Tamworth into Sunday evening, where reports suggested asylum seekers were also being housed. People threw projectiles, smashed windows, started fires and targeted officers, Staffordshire Police said. A group of rioters in Middlesbrough smashed the windows of houses and cars and threw objects at officers on Sunday afternoon, with one seen shouting a racial slur and another telling police: 'It's our f****** country.' Video footage showed groups of youths and young men running from house to house and smashing windows and cars parked outside, throwing bricks, traffic cones and other objects. Youths also appeared to loot a branch of Iceland, with one teenager running out triumphantly while holding a bottle of Friji. Outside hotels in the north of England, thugs tried to force their way inside and threw chairs, bins and bricks Shadow Home Secretary James Cleverly condemned arson attacks on hotels on Sky News this morning Hundreds of arrests have been made and many officers injured, with some having to be taken to hospital Riots spread from Southport across the country last week in horror scenes that have terrified communities And footage from a local park appeared to show a group of white men and boys with faces covered surrounding and attacking a group, with violence erupting before they fled the scene. Nearby, a Muslim leader at a mosque told community members who had turned out to protect their place of worship to 'show the world what Muslims are really like'. Addressing far-right violence in the town, he said: 'They are doing all the wrong things. We don't want to be part of it.' Other local Muslims were seen carrying tea and coffee to police officers on the front line of the town amid fierce violence from the far-right. There were 43 arrests, and significant damage was caused to the Crown Court and the University, Cleveland Police said. Greater Manchester Police issued a Section 60AA order amid disturbances in Bolton, requiring people to 'remove face coverings used to disguise or conceal their appearance'. And in Weymouth, police said three people were arrested and dispersal orders put in place for several teenagers. A 42-year-old man from Yeovil was arrested on suspicion of a public order offence, a 62-year-old man from Yeovil was arrested for being drunk and disorderly and a 27-year-old man from Weymouth was arrested for assault. Assistant Chief Constable Mark Callaghan said two officers were injured - one when a bottle his them in the face and a second who was punched in the head. He said: 'There were rumours circulating that asylum seekers currently housed on the Bibby Stockholm would be moved to Portland, Weymouth or the wider Dorset Council area but the Home Office have confirmed this is not the case. 'In addition, there are no asylum seekers housed in hotels in the Weymouth area.' Hundreds of people came together in Middlesbrough on Monday to begin a huge clean-up operation Local people in Middlesbrough clear broken glass and other hazards from the scene Home Secretary Yvette Cooper appeared on the media round this morning as she condemned far-right violence Riot police officers push back violent far-right activists outside the Holiday Inn Express Hotel after attempts were made to set fire to it - with dozens thought to be inside at the time Rioters attacked police officers in Rotherham on Sunday as far-right thugs led unrest Thugs in balaclavas hurled chairs, wood and bricks at hotels on Sunday, causing thousands of pounds of damage At one of the hotels attacked on Sunday the damage was clear to see once far-right thugs had left the scene Serious damage has been done to buildings including hotels, libraries, local shops and homes since disorder started last week A police dog handler during the far-right demonstration outside the Holiday Inn Express in Rotherham The widespread unrest poses the biggest challenge yet to Sir Keir's premiership, with MPs including Ian Byrne and Dame Priti Patel saying Parliament should be recalled as it was in 2011 so the Commons could debate the riots. The race riots have spread from Southport to cities including London, Leeds, Rotherham, Manchester, Blackbool, Belfast and Aldershot. It comes after Home Secretary Yvette Cooper said there would be a 'reckoning' following unrest across England, as she pledged that anyone involved in the riots will 'pay the price'. She told Sky News: 'It's a total disgrace and there has to be a reckoning. Those individuals who are involved in the disorder need to know that they will pay a price.' 'I've made clear to the police they have my full support in going after the full range of offenders, from those who turned up at the last minute and joined in the looting, to some of the most serious offenders who were pursuing really dangerous arson, really dangerous damage and criminal violence, because we simply cannot stand for this. 'So we should be clear, there will be people who were thinking they were going on their summer holidays this week, and instead they will face a knock on the door from the police. 'They will face arrest and... a police cell, while they wait for trial in order to make sure that they do pay the price for what they have done,' she added. Ms Cooper claimed that social media has put 'rocket boosters' under far-right organisations. But she said the courts are on 'stand-by' to ensure 'swift justice': 'We have made sure that the courts are on stand-by. We've made sure that there are additional prosecutors in place this weekend, and hundreds of arrests have already taken place. So we do expect swift justice to take place.' Scenes in Middlesbrough on Monday morning after residents wake up to the after-effects of rioting Residents saw their car windows smashed and businesses suffered attacks including arson Asked if the Army would be called upon, Ms Cooper said: 'So, the police have the expertise and also the powers in terms of dealing with public order and crime, because this is crime. 'There are also significant additional numbers of public order-trained police, who were not deployed this weekend, so there are considerable additional policing resources that forces can call upon.' Pressed on whether the Government will take action against Tommy Robinson, who has been accused of stoking tensions from afar, Ms Cooper said: 'If it's a crime offline, it's a crime online.' 'You can't just have the the armchair thuggery or the people being able to incite and organise violence and also not face consequences for this,' she added. Shadow Secretary James Cleverly said: 'The things that we have seen are completely unjustified. These are the actions of people who are clearly responding to disinformation online but are obviously motivated by racism. 'We've seen people with Swastika tattoos and making the Nazi salute... attacking people who have no link at all to the terrible incidents that we saw in Southport last week and it is absolutely right that the government is taking firm action. 'When you've people giving Nazi salutes with Swastika tattoos that is clearly far-right extremism. 'It's clearly these attacks on mosques on hotels these are clearly driven by racism and should be unequivocally condemned.' But he also criticised Starmer's new government for not reacting quickly enough: 'They could and should have been quicker, it's worrying that it's only today that cobra is meeting. A masked thug faces off with police officers at the Holiday Inn in Rotherham while fire rages in the background Members of the public with bin bags, dustpans and brushes took to the streets today Volunteers pick up rubbish and debris from outside the Holiday Inn Express in Rotherham Racist graffiti was daubed on the side of the hotel in Tamworth and windows and doors were smashed before thugs attempted to set the building on fire with people still inside One man was filmed threatening to slit the throats of those inside the hotel 'We want to support the government taking firm action against this violence but they have to move much more quickly and they have to be more agile, more decisive. Had I still be Home Secretary I would have called a Cobra much earlier than this.' He continued: 'I'm really uncomfortable with the idea that somehow this violence reflects a wider national move. This is a group of extreme people. 'People committing arson, attacking mosques, targeting asylum hotels, they are not reflective of the country. This is a generous and open hearted country. The people in this country are not represented by the thugs that are attacking people, committing arson and targeting places of worship.' The former first minister of Scotland Humza Yousaf said the army should be called in to stop 'thugs' causing disorder on the streets. Ministers have so far insisted police have the resources required to respond and have rejected calls to bring in the army. Sir Keir said he wanted those who 'feel targeted because of the colour of their skin' to know 'this violent mob do not represent our country'. In his message to rioters, the Prime Minister said: 'I guarantee you will regret taking part in this disorder, whether directly or those whipping up this action online and then running away themselves.' Dame Sara Khan, who was Rishi Sunak's independent adviser for social cohesion and resilience until May, blamed the Conservative government for leaving the country open to far-right violence. 'The writing was clearly on the wall for some time,' she told the Guardian. Writing in The Times, Home Secretary Yvette Cooper said 'there will be reckoning' for people who took part in the unrest and those who 'whipped them up on social media and in online chat forums'. 'Whatever they and some of their political supporters may tell us, these are not patriots standing up for their communities,' she said. 'They are thugs, criminals and extremists who betray the values our country is built on.' She said those responsible would be 'paying the price for years to come'. Ms Cooper slammed actions taken by rioters this week after more than 420 people were arrested, as she warned 'many more will follow' as authorities scour CCTV footage to identify all those involved. Clashes, sparked by the murder of three little girls in Southport last Monday, deteriorated further yesterday when a second migrant hotel was set ablaze in Tamworth, while hundreds cheered and clinked beers outside. In Middlesbrough far-right yobs were filmed stopping traffic to interrogate the passengers to check they were 'white and English'. Keir Starmer also waded in to warn far-Right rioters 'you'll regret taking part' as he tried to stamp his authority over the first major test of his Premiership. He blasted 'far-Right thuggery', for which he promised swift justice as he is expected to call a COBRA meeting today. Meanwhile, the Tories were forced to reprimand Shadow Wales Secretary Lord Davies of Gower after The Mail on Sunday columnist Dan Hodges said there was 'no political justification' for the riots and Lord Davies retorted: 'Labour blocked the Rwanda Bill 130+ times, of course it's politically justified!' This comes as: ROTHERHAM: Police defend themselves as far-right thugs launch planks of wood on Sunday ROTHERHAM: Violent thugs yesterday attacked a hotel reported to be housing asylum seekers ROTHERHAM: A rioter throws blocks of concrete towards a hotel on Sunday This came after Tommy Robinson posted a video of a confrontation in Stoke and falsely claimed two 'protesters' had been stabbed 'by Muslims'. The post was viewed two million times on X. Two hours later, Staffordshire Police confirmed the information was false. Those injured were hit by something thrown by their own side. Actor Laurence Fox has also shared a string of false claims. On Friday night, he posted a list of dozens of acts of violence he alleged had been committed by immigrants under the caption: 'Anyone else had enough?' Among them was the claim that a 'woman [was] beaten to death by two Somalis while walking her dog' – understood to have been a reference to last month's murder of Anita Rose, 57, in Brantham, Suffolk. Three people have been arrested in connection with the murder, but Suffolk Police last night confirmed Fox's tweet was not correct. Hundreds of people gathered as a group of masked thugs threw a burning bush inside the side entrance of the Hotel Inn Express, Leisure Island, in Tamworth yesterday evening. 'Get out England' was graffitied on the side of the building, as police worked to extinguish the fire inside the hotel's stairwell. Some people could be heard chanting 'England, England, England,' while others threw objects at police and set off flares and fireworks. One man could be seen running towards police with what appeared to be a large speaker. Officers clad in riot gear were seen standing in a line guarding the entrance to the hotel. One police officer has suffered a suspected broken arm. Police have said the violent disorder has been 'successfully dispersed' as they appeal to anyone with information to help identify those responsible. A group of protesters were kept apart from counter protesters in Bolton this afternoon A fire extinguisher is sprayed at riot police in Rotherham Property is vandalised as far-right activists in Middlesbrough Thugs try to cram into the migrant hotel through a damaged fire exit in Rotherham ROTHERHAM: Police have been trying to fend off agitators outside the hotel yesterday Yvette Cooper slammed actions taken by rioters this week, as more than 420 people have been arrested, warning 'many more will follow' as authorities scour CCTV footage for criminals Starmer blasted 'far-Right thuggery', for which he promised swift justice amid another day of violent scenes nationwide. He is today expected to hold an emergency COBRA Cabinet meeting, attended by police chiefs, in a bid to ensure the crisis does not spiral further out of control. He also opened the door yesterday to tougher sentences to act as a 'deterrent', saying he will do 'whatever it takes' to crack down on the violence. He said the sentences would mirror action taken to deal with thuggery during the 2011 riots, when he was Director of Public Prosecutions. An asylum seeker who was staying at the Holiday Inn in Tamworth when it was set alight, told the Times of his terror as he was beaten up by the mob when they broke in. 'They came onto this floor and hit me until the police drove them down the corridor.' While another 55-year-old Palestinian said his window was pelted with rocks thrown at his window. 'I was taking some tea when they ran down shouting f***, f***, f***. A shirtless man was shouting and making so much noise. They broke the windows. There were eight on my floor.' While John Woodcock, a former Labour MP, called for MI6, MI5 and GCHQ to be given additional powers that would allow them to ask social media firms to take down accounts that try to 'fan the flames of British extreme actors'. Malaysia has become the first country to warn its citizens about the dangers of visiting Britain at the moment. The statement released by Malaysia's Ministry of Foreign Affairs said: 'Malaysians residing in or travelling to the United Kingdom are urged to stay away from protest areas, remain vigilant and follow the latest updates and guidance provided by local authorities.' More than 300 started marching through Middlesbrough after gathering at the city's Cenotaph. The thugs chanted 'We want our country back' as they made their way through the city centre, before at least two people were taken away in handcuffs. Police officers stand near the broken windows of the hotel during an anti-immigration riot ROTHERHAM: Police try to control the deplorable violence after a mob attacked a hotel A thug throws a brick at a parked car during an anti-immigration riot in Middlesbrough Police have said that there was a 'staggering' surge of violence which led to 35 people being arrested in Middlesbrough on Sunday. Rioters smashed the windows of houses and cars and hurled objects at officers, with one seen shouting a racial slur and another telling police: 'It's our f****** country.' There was significant damage to the crown court, the university and a number of properties in the Parliament Road area. Cleveland Police said it has now arrested 55 people because of the violence that has swept across Teesside as 20 suspects were also arrested after rioting in Hartlepool on Wednesday. Assistant Chief Constable David Felton said: 'The level of violence we have seen today is staggering. 'We know the shocking scenes across Middlesbrough today will have caused alarm amongst communities. 'I want to reassure the people of Teesside that we will continue to identify those involved in these acts of violence and arrest them and put them before the courts.' At one point police used dogs to keep the group back and stop them breaking through and running ahead of the officers patrolling the march. Several pieces of slate were also thrown, along with vapes and full plastic bottles. Some people kicked bollards into the road so that police vehicles driving ahead of the group could not get through, and one man sat on the bonnet of a police car to stop it moving. In Bolton, Greater Manchester, violent clashes between rioters and police broke out, with footage showing the activists pushing against officers who had formed a human barricade. There was also an counter protest in Bolton, where it was reported that large groups of Asian men could be heard shouting 'Allahu Akbar' as they clashed with the far-right. Last night experts condemned the 'dangerous' behaviour and also called for stricter action against those spreading misinformation. Festus Akinbusoye, a former police and crime commissioner, said: 'Of course there are discussions to be had about the level of immigration, the type of immigration and issues like integration. 'But misinformation and xenophobic narratives are wrong, irresponsible and dangerous. These actions are having real world consequences and the people spreading dangerous lies need to be brought to book.' MIDDLESBROUGH: A car burns on Parliament Road after it was set alight by far-right thugs MIDDLESBROUGH: Police raced off with far-right agitators on Parliament Road yesterday A man is detained as Far-right activists hold a demonstration in Middlesbrough An thug wearing a Union Jack mask outside of the Holiday Inn Express An aerial view of the rioters gathering outside of the Holiday Inn Express Counter-protesters shout at police officers as they push against a cordon in Bolton Objects thrown at the hotel as trouble flares during an anti-immigration attack outside the Holiday Inn Express LIVERPOOL: Police officers attend to a shell-shocked colleague after a face-off with thugs on Saturday Mr Akinbusoye, who was Britain's first black PCC, added: 'Our entire criminal justice system is going to have to be revisited in terms of how the authorities are going to be able to legitimately counter and pre-empt these narratives. 'I understand that police forces need to be careful about what they put into the public domain but they need to... publish safe information whenever possible.' Tory leadership hopeful Mel Stride said the scrapping of pilots of rapid-response police units, introduced by the Tories last March, may make it harder to tackle the current disorder. It comes after an angry far-right mob stormed into a hotel in Rotherham yesterday, hurling chairs and spraying fire extinguishers at riot police, while setting bins, a generator and furniture alight. Around 700 violent thugs clad in balaclavas and draped in St George's flags clashed with officers trying to protect the Holiday Inn Express in Rotherham, South Yorkshire since around 2pm this afternoon. At least 10 officers have been injured in the chaos outside the hotel on the northern outskirts of the post-industrial town. One was left unconscious following a head injury, another suffered a suspected fractured elbow and other suspected broken bones. It marks yet another day of violent riots of Britain's streets, with crowds in Middlesbrough setting fire to a car and pushing burning wheelie bins at police, while thugs in Rotherham smash windows and doors as riot police use shields to push them back. South Yorkshire Police said one person has been arrested on suspicion of public order offences. Similar scenes could be seen in Weymouth, as around 400 protesters from opposing sides gathered on the seafront to chant at each other. One side could be heard chanting 'Nazis go home', while the other shouted 'Tommy Robinson'."", ""Boris Johnson believes Britain is not a racist country and backed police to arrest any Black Lives Matter supporter who attacked officers or defaced statues, his spokesman said today Downing Street has said the toppling of the monument to 17th century slave trader Edward Colston in Bristol yesterday was an 'act of criminal damage' as Avon and Somerset Police came under fire for not holding anyone over the incident despite admitting it had identified 17 suspects. His spokesman said: 'The PM doesn't doubt that there continues to be discrimination and racism, but does not agree that this is a racist country. We have made very significant progress on this issue, but there remains more to do and we will not be complacent in our efforts to stamp out racism and discrimination where it happens.' When asked about the Colston statue's destruction he said: 'People can campaign for the removal of a statue, but what happened yesterday was a criminal act and when the criminal law is broken that is unacceptable and the police will want to hold to account those responsible'. Mr Johnson received an update from Met chief Dame Cressida Dick on Sunday night after more disturbances in Westminster, which saw 35 officers injured by rocks and bottles. There were 36 arrests yesterday. 'They have our full support in tackling any violence, vandalism and disorderly behaviour,' the Prime Minister's official spokesman said, adding: 'It is completely unacceptable they were subjected to attacks over the weekend' It came as his Home Secretary Priti Patel vowed to bring violent Black Lives Matter protesters to 'justice' - but police officers battling the activists in the streets say their bosses have got their tactics 'completely wrong'. The Home Secretary said that the UK demonstrations following the murder of George Floyd by police in Minneapolis had been 'subverted by thuggery' and told those responsible: 'Justice will follow'. She told the Commons this afternoon: 'We strongly support the right to protest peacefully but that does not extend to the violent behaviour that we have witnessed across the country throughout the weekend. And when it comes to any assault on our brave police that is completely unacceptable. Any perpetrator should be in absolutely no doubt that they will be arrested and prosecuted.' She said: ‘We are privileged to live in an open, democratic country with many values entrenched not just in our constitution but also in a rules-based system. There is no justification for violence at all. And when it comes to exercising people’s voices and obviously their particular issues and concerns there are many avenues through which those voices and concerns can be raised and made at a local council level. ‘Obviously that is the right way to approach these issues.’ Rank-and-file officers left bloodied by attacks with sticks and rocks have today accused their bosses of allowing 'lawlessness' to take hold because of public perception instead of allowing them to deal with the attackers 'more robustly'. Police push back three young men who try to join the protest in Whitehall yesterday as Boris Johnson said today that Britain is not a racist country Protesters throw statue of Edward Colston into Bristol harbour during a Black Lives Matter protest rally yesterday As the protests descended into chaos, one protester (left and right) was seen climbing on the historic monument The Cenotaph and setting fire to the Union Jack flag Arrests on Whitehall yesterday evening, including this man dragged away by his arms and legs, are said to have sparked violence A protester is placed in a spit hood as he is restrained by Police Officers close to Westminster tube station yesterday Another suspect is pinned down on the fifth night of violence in Central London. Police unions say the tactics have been wrong A protester is pulled away as peaceful demonstrations in the capital turn violent in the wake of the death of George Floyd in the U.S. I tagged the statue of Churchill because he's a confirmed racist': Defiant Black Lives Matter protester says he desecrated the wartime PM's plinth The Black Lives Matter protester who 'tagged' the statue of Winston Churchill said he did it because Britain's greatest Prime Minister was a 'confirmed racist' who cared more about colonialism than black people. The masked young man, who is being searched for by the Metropolitan Police today for the vandalism in Parliament Square, claimed that Mr Churchill only fought the Nazis to protect the empire - not for 'people of colour'. Using black spray paint yesterday he daubed the phrase 'was racist' below the wartime leader's name, leaving the monument reading: 'Churchill was a racist'. A 'f*** your agenda was also added. After leaving Parliament Square last night he spoke to a BBC reporter and said: 'I tagged up the statue of Churchill because he's a confirmed racist. He fought the Nazis to protect the Commonwealth from invasion - he didn't do it for black people or for people of colour. 'It was purely for colonialism. People will be angry - but I'm angry that for many years we have been oppressed'. He added; You can't enslave people, have the largest colonial empire in history and be like 'Yeah let's be peaceful - let's talk'. It don't work like that. We're p***ed off. F**k that'. He also said that people from BAME backgrounds who fought in the Second World War are not properly recognised for their sacrifices. Advertisement In Bristol there have been no arrests at all in relation to the destruction of Colston's statue despite 17 suspects being identified and Avon and Somerset Police have said they have 'no regrets' about not stopping it being pulled down and thrown in the city's harbour. Labour's shadow justice secretary David Lammy has compared those who toppled the monument to followers of Martin Luther King and the suffragettes - but 'should have come down a long time ago in a democratic way'. He told ITV's Good Morning Britain: 'I'm quite sure that those young people who brought that statue down knew that they would be facing the law but that was a price they were willing to pay and there are many examples throughout history, from Martin Luther King to Harvey Milk, who protested on behalf of gay rights. Many, many men and women following these people and being prepared to break the law because they believed the issue of justice they wanted to shine a light on was a bigger project'. Since last Wednesday 49 officers in London have been injured but there have only been around 60 arrests - 36 people alone yesterday - and Ken Marsh, chief of the Met Police Federation, has asked Commissioner Dame Cressida Dick to apologise to her officers and said: 'Let me be clear, we as a police service can deal with these outbreaks of disorder, no problems. But it seems we are more concerned about image and perception rather than protecting our brave police officers and maintaining order. 'It's sadly now clear – and frankly has been clear for a number of days - that some people are using these protests as an excuse to attack police officers. We have had enough warnings. The tactics being used by the Metropolitan Police are very wrong. And need to be looked at as a matter of urgency.' In Bristol yesterday a group armed with ropes and tools dragged down the statue of slave trader Edward Colston in a 'premeditated' act of criminal damage and were then allowed to roll it to the city's dock and hurl it into the water. Superintendent Andy Bennett, who was in charge in the city yesterday, said he had 'no regrets' about not intervening as activists dragged the statue down - but conceded that officers were 'duty-bound' to investigate. He said: 'As a police officer, I don't get to choose which laws I uphold and which I don't. We are duty-bound to investigate this. We know and have identified 17 main offenders in terms of tearing it down and an investigation is underway.' Avon and Somerset Police chief constable Andy Marsh has this aftenoon backed the decision and said that had his officers intervened to arrest those responsible there would have been a 'very violent confrontation'. 'To arrest suspects would likely to lead to injuries to suspects, injuries to officers, and people who were not involved in damaging property being thrown into a very violent confrontation with the police that could have had serious ramifications for the city of Bristol and beyond,' Mr Marsh said. 'Can you imagine scenes of police in Bristol fighting with protesters who were damaging the statue of a man who is reputed to have gathered much of his fortune through the slave trade? 'I think there would have been very serious implications and whilst I certainly do not condone crime or damage of any sort, I fully support the actions of my officers. 'They responded with common sense, sound judgment and in the best interest of public safety.' The chairman of the Police Federation, which represents all officers in England and Wales, has criticised Avon and Somerset Police for its decision not to intervene in a protest in Bristol where a statue of a slave trader was torn down. John Apter told BBC Breakfast: 'To have no police presence there I think sent quite a negative message. I am a police officer so I don't support this lawlessness we saw where this statue was ripped down and rolled down the street and pushed into the river because that is not how we do things'. In London 22 officers were injured over the weekend on top of 13 last week after being pelted with objects on Whitehall. One activist clambered onto The Cenotaph, the war monument dedicated to the millions of lives lost during the First World War, and set fire to the Union Jack flag, while another gang defaced the monument to Winston Churchill in Westminster and daubed 'was a racist' on its plinth. Police officers were shown being chased down streets and across bridges by protesters throwing bottles and rocks. One Met Police riot unit tackling the violence tweeted a picture of a boulder thrown at them last night and said: 'No it's not an asteroid. It's one of the many things we had thrown at us last night between Parliament Square and Elephant and Castle. Multiple officers injured from our line alone. Unacceptable'. As police unions told MailOnline London Mayor Sadiq Khan must close down the city and ban any further Black Lives Matter protests, it also emerged: Policing minister Kit Malthouse said there would need to be a 'post-mortem' into how the anti-racism protests across the weekend were enforced - but said it was not practical to arrest all those who took part for breaking coronavirus-related restrictions; Met Police Chief Cressida Dick says she is 'depressed' by the violence and said: 'The violent criminality we saw is disgraceful and will have been frightening' Bristol's Mayor Marvin Rees says he is in 'no rush' to fish out the Edward Colston statue and says when it is pulled from the dock it will probably go to a museum rather than be put back; Sir Keir Starmer has said the toppling of a slave trader statue during Black Lives Matter protests in Bristol was 'completely wrong' - but adds the statue should have been removed some time ago; When asked whether police should have looked to have stopped the Colston statute from being toppled in Bristol, Kit Malthouse told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: 'I know if they (police) possibly can prevent crime taking place by intervening in a public order situation they will, but obviously it is a difficult situation for frontline commanders and no doubt there will be a post-mortem, if you like, of the public order situation in Bristol, and indeed elsewhere in the country, to make sure lessons can be learned.' People celebrate in the Winston Churchill statue in Parliament Square yesterday - the day it was defaced. It is not not known if these two men were involved Protesters tied ropes around the statue of Edward Colston in Bristol city centre, before tearing it to the ground on Sunday Another suspect is led away by police on Vauxhall Bridge - one of around 60 arrests in London since protests began last Wednse Dozens of police officers have now been injured in the attacks on them in the past five days. Many have questioned why they are not all in riot gear BBC blasted for headline saying Black Lives Matter protests in London were 'largely peaceful' The BBC were last night blasted for labelling Black Lives Matter protests in London as 'largely peaceful' after 27 police officers were injured - including one officer who was pictured bleeding from the head. Violent scenes showed police officers injured on the streets and others being pelted by objects as they ran for safety as a peaceful anti-racism demonstration turned violent yesterday. Metropolitan Police chiefs say 27 police officers were injured, 14 alone on Saturday, and 13 across last week, while a further eight were confirmed to have been injured last night - bringing the total to 35 in London since protests began. One scene showing police being chased by protesters as they fled a barrage of objects thrown at them has been described as 'despicable' by the Met Police Federation - which represents rank-and-file officers. But criticism was turned on the BBC last night after the publicly-funded news organisation headlined one of its online pieces about the protests: '27 police officers injured during largely peaceful protests anti-racism protests in London'. It was later changed to: 'George Floyd: London anti-racism protests leave 27 officers hurt'. Among the critics of the original headline were former UKIP leader and now Brexit Party founder Nigel Farage, who said on Twitter: 'Typical of the BBC, this is why the public are turning away from them.' Former MEP Patrick O'Flynn said: 'How can an event that has left 27 police officers injured merit the description 'largely peaceful'.' Advertisement But Mr Malthouse indicated that it would not have been practical to arrest all those who took part for breaking coronavirus-related restrictions. He added: 'We did say right at the start that this was against the regulations. 'But obviously the reality was that people were going to come anyway. Other than arresting whatever it was - 15,000 people in London and many more elsewhere - managing the protest was I think the best call given the strength of feeling that was running.' Ken Marsh, chairman of the Metropolitan Police Federation, called for tube stations in central London to be shut and Hyde Park and Whitehall - the areas targeted by protesters last week - to be closed off to the public. The draconian measures, he said, will also help stop tens of thousands of people swarming into the city ignoring social distancing regulations during the Covid-19 pandemic. Mr Marsh's comments come after violent clashes over the weekend saw a female mounted officer suffer a broken collarbone, cracked ribs and a collapsed lung after she came off her horse when the animal was spooked by flares and other missiles hurled by protesters. Officers were left bruised and bloodied after being pelted with bottles and road signs and hit with sticks and metal poles by yobs who also vandalised the Cenotaph and statue to Sir Winston Churchill outside Parliament. A total of 41 arrests were made over the weekend. With fears over further trouble this weekend - as right-wing activist Tommy Robinson pledged to travel to London on Saturday to join football fans in protecting the capital's monuments - Mr Marsh told MailOnline: 'These protests have to stop now. 'We need to be more robust in terms of policing and we need to stop this happening. We know about it, we've got the intelligence. The Mayor Sadiq Khan now needs to come out and say 'I'm not having this in my city'. 'We are in the middle of a pandemic here. And we allow this to take place, even though these protests are increasingly being hijacked by those intent on confrontation with the police. 'We shouldn't have allowed it, we should have shut the tubes, shut Hyde Park and shut Whitehall. A police officer sits on the ground and receives medical attention after demonstrations became violent during a Black Lives Matter protest in London yesterday Another suspect is taken into custody - it appears there have been no charges in relation to the disorder yet A council worker removes graffiti from the statue of Sir Winston Churchill at Parliament Square Graffiti was also removed from the plinth of Abraham Lincoln, overlooking Parliament outside the Supreme Court A poster hangs from the statue of the 18th Century philosopher David Hume on the Royal Mile, Edinburgh, as protesters target other statues The remains of the Edward Colston statue in Bristol which was pulled down by Black Lives Matter protesters yesterday The Harbour Master checks the depth of the area of water where the statue of Edward Colston was dumped - but the Mayor of Bristol says he's in no rush to fish it out 'People should be allowed to protest, I've got no problem with that, it's the DNA within us as Brits that we protest. But in the middle of this pandemic? No. Bristol mayor says Colston statue WILL be fished out of docks - but says it should be put in a museum Bristol Mayor Marvin Rees said the statue was still underwater but confirmed it would be removed at some point and should be put in a museum. Around 10,000 people took part in the protest on Sunday, which was praised by the force for being 'peaceful and respectful'. Marvin Rees, the elected Labour Mayor of Bristol, praised the police's handling of the event as 'intelligent and nuanced'. Mr Rees said he could not condone the damage and was also concerned about the implications of a mass gathering in terms of the coronavirus pandemic. 'I'm the mixed race child of a Welsh-English white woman and a black Jamaican father,' he told BBC Breakfast. 'One of my ancestors would have been taken on a ship from Africa to the Caribbean. 'That statue is an affront to me and there's a plaque on it as well that describes him as a 'wise and virtuous son', so that's a double insult. 'It's not something that I as a Bristolian would have looked on with pride and it had been a point of debate in the city.' Mr Rees said Bristol only started to really discuss its relationship with slavery in a 'meaningful way' about 20 years ago and that conversation would now 'go up a few gears'. 'We have a statue up to someone who made his money buying and selling people,' he told BBC Breakfast. 'That statue is now underwater, which is a piece of poetic and historical irony because, undoubtedly, people would have been thrown off the sides of the ships during the journey themselves and there will be many African bodies on the bottom of the water.' Mr Rees said the statue would be pulled out of the harbour 'at some point' and placed in a museum. Placards from the Black Lives Matter march, which were laid around the plinth where the statue had stood, have also been collected and will be put on display. Advertisement 'Let's get this dealt with, let's make sure we're all safe in relation to Covid 19 because all lives matter, and then if you want to protest do what you want to do. 'But at the moment this is just selfish. It's not necessary. My colleagues have no choice whatsoever, they have to be there and I thought they did an incredible job over the weekend. 'The provocation was quite high to which they didn't react to. They took the abuse that was thrown at them. I don't know why they're taking this sort of abuse on the back of something that took place 5000 miles away but this is where we are. I thought they did a sterling job without fear or favour. 'The problem is now that I think people have cottoned onto the fact they can now get away with coming out onto the streets, whereas they couldn't when they were locked up at home for ten weeks. 'But the legislation is that not more than six people can gather. Is it two sets of rules? This is just ridiculous and it's putting all my colleagues at risk and I don't want my colleagues to be put at risk.' The worst of the trouble erupted outside Downing Street on Saturday evening after a largely peaceful protest over the death of African-American George Floyd, who died in U.S police custody two weeks ago. Missiles, including several flares, were hurled over security gates guarding the entrance to the Prime Minister's official residence by a crowd who had earlier chanted 'Boris Johnson's a racist'. The violence prompted officers in riot gear to intervene followed by the mounted division. In the chaos that ensued, a mounted came off her horse after colliding into traffic lights as protesters threw fireworks, bangers, bottles and at one point even a Boris Bike. Dramatic footage showed a riderless horse bolting back down Whitehall, colliding with an innocent demonstrator as it do so. The injured officer was pictured lying motionless and unconscious on the floor before she was dragged away by her colleagues. She is now stable in hospital. Mr Marsh praised the officer and said: 'She's a hero because, like my other colleagues, she put herself on the line for a protest that was unlawful, shouldn't have taken place and, by its very nature, could have caused thousands more deaths by being held in the middle of a pandemic. 'The officer is currently stable in hospital but serious injuries have been sustained, a broken collarbone, broken ribs and a collapsed lung. Not life-threatening but it will take quite a while to recover, three to four months I'd imagine. 'They are not nice injuries. Anyone who's had a broken collarbone will know that it's a horrible injury because it's one of those that's very difficult to heal. Likewise broken ribs and a collapsed lung are also horrible because there isn't anything you can prescribe for them. 'She will be alright but it's going to take a bit of time.' Warehouse worker tells how he joined four Army cadet volunteers to scrub off 'Churchill was a racist' graffiti A group of youong men of remove graffiti from a statue of Winston Churchill at Parliament Square in London this morning A group of volunteers including four Army cadets cleaned up a memorial to Winston Churchill in London this morning after it was defaced by activists during yesterday's violent Black Lives Matter protests. The men scrubbed graffiti off the statue one day after the phrase 'was racist' was added in spray paint by protesters below the wartime leader's name, leaving the monument reading: 'Churchill was a racist'. A fifth man, warehouse worker called Max, 25, who had just finished a night shift and went to Saturday's protests, also cleaned up, telling MailOnline he went there because it 'just felt like it was the right thing to do.' The volunteers, who brought their own cleaning products, only stopped and left when a professional cleaner - remarkably called Winston - also turned up this morning and said he had been asked to do the job professionally. It came as the clean-up also began in Bristol as council crews removed BLM placards and used chemicals and spray to clean graffit off the plinth from which the statue of slave trader Edward Colston was torn down yesterday. Speaking to MailOnline today, Max said: 'For me it was a decision I made last night. I worked during a long night shift and I received the news that the statue was being defaced. I just felt like it was the right thing to do. 'It was completely independent, I thought to myself I'd be the only one there. I didn't mean to antagonise or upset anyone to do it. When I got there I was pleased to see four young Army cadets already cleaning the statue. 'I did actually attend the Black Lives Matter protest on Saturday in support of the movement. I feel strongly to show solidarity. I understand the actions that carried on late into last night were that of a minority. 'But I will not have war memorials defaced. The violence and to see the anger and hatred towards the police was very, very hard to watch for me. It came to standing up for what's right.' Max added: 'We brought our own cleaning products and they weren't really up to the job. We only left because remarkably a gentleman called Winston asked us to stop because he'd been asked to do the job professionally.' Advertisement Just 24-hours after the mayhem in Westminster another Black Lives Matter protest took place in London yesterday. Thousands gathered outside the American Embassy, just south of the River Thames in Nine Elms, before heading back into Westminster, where further clashes with police took place. One officer was seen with blood pouring down his head after being hit by a traffic cone while mobile phone footage showed other officers being forced to run from a baying bottle-throwing mob. A dispersal order was enforced in Westminster until 6am this morning as riot police battled into the night to move a group of about 50 violent protesters on. Earlier in the day, Black Lives Matter protesters in Bristol had toppled a bronze statue of 17th century slave trader Edward Colston and rolled it into the harbour. The Prime Minister condemned the trouble in both cities. In a statement he said the BLM protests were 'subverted by thuggery' and that the violence was a 'betrayal' of their cause. And last night English Defence League founder Tommy Robinson blasted the 'Soft-handed' police approach for failing to protect the Cenotaph and the Sir Winston Churchill statue. He told his followers on social media that he would be heading into London on Saturday, adding: 'I cannot believe what's come of our capital city. 'Attack that statue like you did in Bristol today and think there's not going to be a British public there to confront you about it, you're wrong. 'You watch next Saturday how many people turn up.' A group called the Democratic Football Lads Alliance, made up of football fans from around Britain, has pledged to form a protective ring around London's war memorials and statues to prevent them from being damaged in protests. The clean-up began in Bristol today as council teams removed BLM placards and used chemicals to clean off graffiti defacing the plinth that held the Edward Colston statue in Bristol, and another of Winston Churchill in London. On the Colston statue, Bristol Mayor Marvin Rees said it will be fished out 'at some point' and it is 'highly likely' to end up in one of the city's museums - with a debate set to be held over what should replace it on the plinth. Speaking about the general public disorder, Home Secretary Priti Patel told Sky News: 'I think that is utterly disgraceful and that speaks to the acts of public disorder that actually have now become a distraction from the cause in which people are actually protesting about and trying to empathise and sympathise with. 'That is completely an unacceptable act and that speaks to the vandalism - again as we saw (on Saturday) in London - but sheer vandalism and disorder completely is unacceptable. And it's right the police follow up on that and make sure that justice is taken with those individuals responsible for such disorderly and lawless behaviour.' The shocking images come as global demonstrations intensify after George Floyd, a 46-year-old black man, died after police officer Derek Chauvin put his knee on his neck in Minneapolis on May 25 for nine minutes. Demonstrators flouted social distancing rules yesterday to flood the streets around the US Embassy in London before marching on Westminster, protesting against racial injustice and police brutality. While the majority of the protests remained peaceful, violence erupted yet again, with images showing police and demonstrators suffering injuries during the melee which led to 12 arrests and eight officers being injured. The Metropolitan Police confirmed the majority of the arrests had been made for public order offences and one was for criminal damage following the incident at the Cenotaph. Also yesterday, images showed Black Lives Matter protesters tearing down a statue of 17th century slave trader and philanthropist Edward Colston in Bristol and dumping it in the harbour. Footage showed demonstrators, packed closely together - despite social distancing guidelines, heaving the metal monument down with ropes before cheering and dancing around it, with many placing their knees on the fallen statue as it lay on the ground - in a nod to the death of Mr Floyd. Marvin Rees, the Mayor of Bristol, told BBC Radio Bristol today: 'It's still underwater. At some point it will (be fished out) but we've a number of priorities in the city at the moment, not least trying to face up to an £80million gap in our budget that we've been left with by national Government not funding us adequately for Covid.' He added: 'I think that there's a really incredible opportunity to talk about ourselves and to make a decision about what we think should go on a plinth in the city to tell us about who we are, not just who we are but who we want to be and to really use that as a place to celebrate something about ourselves, the best of ourselves. 'What I would look forward to is having that city discussion. In the meantime it's highly likely that the Colston statue will end up in one of our museums.' But Government minister for crime and policing Kit Malthouse told BBC Breakfast: 'A crime was committed, criminal damage was committed, there should be evidence gathered and a prosecution should follow.' 'There is an elected mayor of Bristol, there is a council in Bristol and it is via those democratic means that we will resolve these issues in this country - not by people showing up with ropes and tools and committing criminal damage. We have to have a sense of order and democracy - that is how we sort things out and that is what should have happened.' But Labour's shadow justice secretary David Lammy told ITV's Good Morning Britain: 'I do absolutely support protest in the incident of the Colston statue. This is a man who transported over 80,000 African men women and children. It's shameful, shameful - we're actually discussing whether he should have a statue. People have been calling for that statue to come down in Bristol for many years. There may be a role for statues such as this in museums where there is proper context where they can think about their contribution to society as well as what they got wrong.'

But she added: 'There are no excuses for the unlawful behaviour and disorder we have witnessed throughout the weekend including the disgraceful vandalism we saw in Bristol and the utterly appalling abuse of our police officers.' Commenting on the desecration of Churchill's statue, she added: 'Winston Churchill is one of the greatest Britons who ever lived. We have him to thank for our very freedom to protest. The vandals who did this are repulsive criminals who I want to see brought to justice immediately.' Police officers had suffered 'serious injuries' inflicted by 'a small minority of violent people using the guise of peaceful protest to pursue reckless lawlessness,' she said. She added: 'I know that the British public will be as appalled as I am at those scenes.' Outside Downing Street some demonstrators were seen turning violent as police officers tried to control the mass chaos and form a barricade with their riot shields. A group of members of the public remove graffiti from the statue of former British Prime Minister Winston Churchill today A person cleans graffiti from the statue of Winston Churchill at Parliament Square in London this morning Yesteday, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the anti-racism demonstrations had been 'subverted by thuggery' following a day of protests across the UK. He tweeted: 'People have a right to protest peacefully & while observing social distancing but they have no right to attack the police. 'These demonstrations have been subverted by thuggery - and they are a betrayal of the cause they purport to serve. Those responsible will be held to account.' Hours after the incident that saw the statue of Edward Colston pulled down in Bristol, the M6 in the Midlands was closed as Black Lives Matter protesters walked down the carriageway. A video posted on social media showed crowds of people covering the motorway at the Exhall interchange near Coventry as traffic remained stationary on the other side. Flares are launched into the air as police and demonstrators clash during Black Lives Matter protest in the nation's capital today Members of the police force attempt to disperse the crowds as a demonstrator climbs onto the national war monument in London One eyewitness claimed there were around 100 people who were heard chanting 'Black Lives Matter' as they took part in the demonstrations. Many drivers on the motorway were pictured emerging from their cars to watch the protests, which began at around 5pm, and the southbound carriageway was closed for around two hours. Today spokesperson for the protests in London, Superintendent Jo Edwards, said: 'Regrettably officers were faced with further scenes of violence and disorder following a day of predominantly peaceful protest throughout the capital. 'This is a hugely impassioned movement and we understand the public's desire to have their voices heard – however it is not right that this passion has turned into violent attacks on officers. 'I would like to thank our officers, and those from the City of London Police and British Transport Police for their professionalism in the face of entirely unacceptable behaviour. 'Overnight our policing operation will continue and I would urge demonstrators thinking of returning to stay at home. The threat of Coronavirus remains very real, and we need you to protect yourselves, your friends and your family.' As the chaos continued, one protester, who took part in defacing the statue of the former Prime Minister Winston Churchill, was heard on camera saying: 'Tagged up Churchill as a racist on the statue of Churchill because he is a confirmed racist. 'He didn't fight the Nazis for the commonwealth or for anything else or for any personal freedoms. He fought the Nazis purely to protect the commonwealth against the invasion by foreign forces. He didn't do it for black people or people of colour. He did it purely for colonialism. 'People will be angry but at the end of the day I'm angry that for many years we've been oppressed. You can't enslave people, have the largest colonial empire ever in history and they try and come like ''yeah let's be peaceful'' it don't work like that.'

In a statement yesterday the police chief said: 'I am deeply saddened and depressed that a minority of protesters became violent towards officers in central London yesterday evening. 'This led to 14 officers being injured, in addition to 13 hurt in earlier protests this week. 'We have made a number of arrests and justice will follow. I know many who were seeking to make their voices heard will be as appalled as I am by those scenes. 'I would urge protesters to please find another way to make your views heard which does not involve coming out on the streets of London, risking yourself, your families and officers as we continue to face [the deadly coronavirus].' Following the destruction of the statue in Bristol today former Chancellor of the Exchequer Sajid Javid condemned protesters' decision to force it down, declaring on Twitter: 'This is not OK'. Speaking after the demonstration, superintendent Andy Bennett vowed there would be an investigation into the 'act of criminal damage,' near Bristol Harbourside, where slave ships once docked centuries ago. Meanwhile Home Secretary Priti Patel told Sky News: 'I think that is utterly disgraceful.

The scenes come as demonstrations continue to increase around the world after George Floyd, a 46-year-old African American man, died after police officer Derek Chauvin put his knee on his neck in Minneapolis on May 25 for nine minutes. Following the death of George Floyd, three other officers who were also present at the scene, Thomas Lane, J Alexander Kueng and Tou Thao – were charged with aiding and abetting second-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. Earlier today Health Secretary Matt Hancock said it is 'undoubtedly a risk' that there will be an increase in Covid-19 cases following the protests, as he urged people not to gather in groups of more than six people. Mr Hancock said he supported the activists' arguments, but said: 'Please don't gather in groups of more than six people because there is also a pandemic that we must address and control.' Demonstrators in Bristol were heard laughing and cheering as the statue of the slave trader was toppled by protesters into the harbour Just hours later the M6 was forced to close closed in the Midlands as Black Lives Matter protesters walked down the carriageway A protester wearing a face covering joins other demonstrators and walks along the M6 during a Black Lives Matter rally earlier today"", ""Boris Johnson believes Britain is not a racist country and backed police to arrest any Black Lives Matter supporter who attacked officers or defaced statues, his spokesman said today Downing Street has said the toppling of the monument to 17th century slave trader Edward Colston in Bristol yesterday was an 'act of criminal damage' as Avon and Somerset Police came under fire for not holding anyone over the incident despite admitting it had identified 17 suspects. His spokesman said: 'The PM doesn't doubt that there continues to be discrimination and racism, but does not agree that this is a racist country. We have made very significant progress on this issue, but there remains more to do and we will not be complacent in our efforts to stamp out racism and discrimination where it happens.' When asked about the Colston statue's destruction he said: 'People can campaign for the removal of a statue, but what happened yesterday was a criminal act and when the criminal law is broken that is unacceptable and the police will want to hold to account those responsible'. Mr Johnson received an update from Met chief Dame Cressida Dick on Sunday night after more disturbances in Westminster, which saw 35 officers injured by rocks and bottles. There were 36 arrests yesterday. 'They have our full support in tackling any violence, vandalism and disorderly behaviour,' the Prime Minister's official spokesman said, adding: 'It is completely unacceptable they were subjected to attacks over the weekend' It came as his Home Secretary Priti Patel vowed to bring violent Black Lives Matter protesters to 'justice' - but police officers battling the activists in the streets say their bosses have got their tactics 'completely wrong'. The Home Secretary said that the UK demonstrations following the murder of George Floyd by police in Minneapolis had been 'subverted by thuggery' and told those responsible: 'Justice will follow'. She told the Commons this afternoon: 'We strongly support the right to protest peacefully but that does not extend to the violent behaviour that we have witnessed across the country throughout the weekend. And when it comes to any assault on our brave police that is completely unacceptable. Any perpetrator should be in absolutely no doubt that they will be arrested and prosecuted.' She said: ‘We are privileged to live in an open, democratic country with many values entrenched not just in our constitution but also in a rules-based system. There is no justification for violence at all. And when it comes to exercising people’s voices and obviously their particular issues and concerns there are many avenues through which those voices and concerns can be raised and made at a local council level. ‘Obviously that is the right way to approach these issues.’ Rank-and-file officers left bloodied by attacks with sticks and rocks have today accused their bosses of allowing 'lawlessness' to take hold because of public perception instead of allowing them to deal with the attackers 'more robustly'. Police push back three young men who try to join the protest in Whitehall yesterday as Boris Johnson said today that Britain is not a racist country Protesters throw statue of Edward Colston into Bristol harbour during a Black Lives Matter protest rally yesterday As the protests descended into chaos, one protester (left and right) was seen climbing on the historic monument The Cenotaph and setting fire to the Union Jack flag Arrests on Whitehall yesterday evening, including this man dragged away by his arms and legs, are said to have sparked violence A protester is placed in a spit hood as he is restrained by Police Officers close to Westminster tube station yesterday Another suspect is pinned down on the fifth night of violence in Central London. Police unions say the tactics have been wrong A protester is pulled away as peaceful demonstrations in the capital turn violent in the wake of the death of George Floyd in the U.S. I tagged the statue of Churchill because he's a confirmed racist': Defiant Black Lives Matter protester says he desecrated the wartime PM's plinth The Black Lives Matter protester who 'tagged' the statue of Winston Churchill said he did it because Britain's greatest Prime Minister was a 'confirmed racist' who cared more about colonialism than black people. The masked young man, who is being searched for by the Metropolitan Police today for the vandalism in Parliament Square, claimed that Mr Churchill only fought the Nazis to protect the empire - not for 'people of colour'. Using black spray paint yesterday he daubed the phrase 'was racist' below the wartime leader's name, leaving the monument reading: 'Churchill was a racist'. A 'f*** your agenda was also added. After leaving Parliament Square last night he spoke to a BBC reporter and said: 'I tagged up the statue of Churchill because he's a confirmed racist. He fought the Nazis to protect the Commonwealth from invasion - he didn't do it for black people or for people of colour. 'It was purely for colonialism. People will be angry - but I'm angry that for many years we have been oppressed'. He added; You can't enslave people, have the largest colonial empire in history and be like 'Yeah let's be peaceful - let's talk'. It don't work like that. We're p***ed off. F**k that'. He also said that people from BAME backgrounds who fought in the Second World War are not properly recognised for their sacrifices. Advertisement In Bristol there have been no arrests at all in relation to the destruction of Colston's statue despite 17 suspects being identified and Avon and Somerset Police have said they have 'no regrets' about not stopping it being pulled down and thrown in the city's harbour. Labour's shadow justice secretary David Lammy has compared those who toppled the monument to followers of Martin Luther King and the suffragettes - but 'should have come down a long time ago in a democratic way'. He told ITV's Good Morning Britain: 'I'm quite sure that those young people who brought that statue down knew that they would be facing the law but that was a price they were willing to pay and there are many examples throughout history, from Martin Luther King to Harvey Milk, who protested on behalf of gay rights. Many, many men and women following these people and being prepared to break the law because they believed the issue of justice they wanted to shine a light on was a bigger project'. Since last Wednesday 49 officers in London have been injured but there have only been around 60 arrests - 36 people alone yesterday - and Ken Marsh, chief of the Met Police Federation, has asked Commissioner Dame Cressida Dick to apologise to her officers and said: 'Let me be clear, we as a police service can deal with these outbreaks of disorder, no problems. But it seems we are more concerned about image and perception rather than protecting our brave police officers and maintaining order. 'It's sadly now clear – and frankly has been clear for a number of days - that some people are using these protests as an excuse to attack police officers. We have had enough warnings. The tactics being used by the Metropolitan Police are very wrong. And need to be looked at as a matter of urgency.' In Bristol yesterday a group armed with ropes and tools dragged down the statue of slave trader Edward Colston in a 'premeditated' act of criminal damage and were then allowed to roll it to the city's dock and hurl it into the water. Superintendent Andy Bennett, who was in charge in the city yesterday, said he had 'no regrets' about not intervening as activists dragged the statue down - but conceded that officers were 'duty-bound' to investigate. He said: 'As a police officer, I don't get to choose which laws I uphold and which I don't. We are duty-bound to investigate this. We know and have identified 17 main offenders in terms of tearing it down and an investigation is underway.' Avon and Somerset Police chief constable Andy Marsh has this aftenoon backed the decision and said that had his officers intervened to arrest those responsible there would have been a 'very violent confrontation'. 'To arrest suspects would likely to lead to injuries to suspects, injuries to officers, and people who were not involved in damaging property being thrown into a very violent confrontation with the police that could have had serious ramifications for the city of Bristol and beyond,' Mr Marsh said. 'Can you imagine scenes of police in Bristol fighting with protesters who were damaging the statue of a man who is reputed to have gathered much of his fortune through the slave trade? 'I think there would have been very serious implications and whilst I certainly do not condone crime or damage of any sort, I fully support the actions of my officers. 'They responded with common sense, sound judgment and in the best interest of public safety.' The chairman of the Police Federation, which represents all officers in England and Wales, has criticised Avon and Somerset Police for its decision not to intervene in a protest in Bristol where a statue of a slave trader was torn down. John Apter told BBC Breakfast: 'To have no police presence there I think sent quite a negative message. I am a police officer so I don't support this lawlessness we saw where this statue was ripped down and rolled down the street and pushed into the river because that is not how we do things'. In London 22 officers were injured over the weekend on top of 13 last week after being pelted with objects on Whitehall. One activist clambered onto The Cenotaph, the war monument dedicated to the millions of lives lost during the First World War, and set fire to the Union Jack flag, while another gang defaced the monument to Winston Churchill in Westminster and daubed 'was a racist' on its plinth. Police officers were shown being chased down streets and across bridges by protesters throwing bottles and rocks. One Met Police riot unit tackling the violence tweeted a picture of a boulder thrown at them last night and said: 'No it's not an asteroid. It's one of the many things we had thrown at us last night between Parliament Square and Elephant and Castle. Multiple officers injured from our line alone. Unacceptable'. As police unions told MailOnline London Mayor Sadiq Khan must close down the city and ban any further Black Lives Matter protests, it also emerged: Policing minister Kit Malthouse said there would need to be a 'post-mortem' into how the anti-racism protests across the weekend were enforced - but said it was not practical to arrest all those who took part for breaking coronavirus-related restrictions; Met Police Chief Cressida Dick says she is 'depressed' by the violence and said: 'The violent criminality we saw is disgraceful and will have been frightening' Bristol's Mayor Marvin Rees says he is in 'no rush' to fish out the Edward Colston statue and says when it is pulled from the dock it will probably go to a museum rather than be put back; Sir Keir Starmer has said the toppling of a slave trader statue during Black Lives Matter protests in Bristol was 'completely wrong' - but adds the statue should have been removed some time ago; When asked whether police should have looked to have stopped the Colston statute from being toppled in Bristol, Kit Malthouse told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: 'I know if they (police) possibly can prevent crime taking place by intervening in a public order situation they will, but obviously it is a difficult situation for frontline commanders and no doubt there will be a post-mortem, if you like, of the public order situation in Bristol, and indeed elsewhere in the country, to make sure lessons can be learned.' People celebrate in the Winston Churchill statue in Parliament Square yesterday - the day it was defaced. It is not not known if these two men were involved Protesters tied ropes around the statue of Edward Colston in Bristol city centre, before tearing it to the ground on Sunday Another suspect is led away by police on Vauxhall Bridge - one of around 60 arrests in London since protests began last Wednse Dozens of police officers have now been injured in the attacks on them in the past five days. Many have questioned why they are not all in riot gear BBC blasted for headline saying Black Lives Matter protests in London were 'largely peaceful' The BBC were last night blasted for labelling Black Lives Matter protests in London as 'largely peaceful' after 27 police officers were injured - including one officer who was pictured bleeding from the head. Violent scenes showed police officers injured on the streets and others being pelted by objects as they ran for safety as a peaceful anti-racism demonstration turned violent yesterday. Metropolitan Police chiefs say 27 police officers were injured, 14 alone on Saturday, and 13 across last week, while a further eight were confirmed to have been injured last night - bringing the total to 35 in London since protests began. One scene showing police being chased by protesters as they fled a barrage of objects thrown at them has been described as 'despicable' by the Met Police Federation - which represents rank-and-file officers. But criticism was turned on the BBC last night after the publicly-funded news organisation headlined one of its online pieces about the protests: '27 police officers injured during largely peaceful protests anti-racism protests in London'. It was later changed to: 'George Floyd: London anti-racism protests leave 27 officers hurt'. Among the critics of the original headline were former UKIP leader and now Brexit Party founder Nigel Farage, who said on Twitter: 'Typical of the BBC, this is why the public are turning away from them.' Former MEP Patrick O'Flynn said: 'How can an event that has left 27 police officers injured merit the description 'largely peaceful'.' Advertisement But Mr Malthouse indicated that it would not have been practical to arrest all those who took part for breaking coronavirus-related restrictions. He added: 'We did say right at the start that this was against the regulations. 'But obviously the reality was that people were going to come anyway. Other than arresting whatever it was - 15,000 people in London and many more elsewhere - managing the protest was I think the best call given the strength of feeling that was running.' Ken Marsh, chairman of the Metropolitan Police Federation, called for tube stations in central London to be shut and Hyde Park and Whitehall - the areas targeted by protesters last week - to be closed off to the public. The draconian measures, he said, will also help stop tens of thousands of people swarming into the city ignoring social distancing regulations during the Covid-19 pandemic. Mr Marsh's comments come after violent clashes over the weekend saw a female mounted officer suffer a broken collarbone, cracked ribs and a collapsed lung after she came off her horse when the animal was spooked by flares and other missiles hurled by protesters. Officers were left bruised and bloodied after being pelted with bottles and road signs and hit with sticks and metal poles by yobs who also vandalised the Cenotaph and statue to Sir Winston Churchill outside Parliament. A total of 41 arrests were made over the weekend. With fears over further trouble this weekend - as right-wing activist Tommy Robinson pledged to travel to London on Saturday to join football fans in protecting the capital's monuments - Mr Marsh told MailOnline: 'These protests have to stop now. 'We need to be more robust in terms of policing and we need to stop this happening. We know about it, we've got the intelligence. The Mayor Sadiq Khan now needs to come out and say 'I'm not having this in my city'. 'We are in the middle of a pandemic here. And we allow this to take place, even though these protests are increasingly being hijacked by those intent on confrontation with the police. 'We shouldn't have allowed it, we should have shut the tubes, shut Hyde Park and shut Whitehall.

But in the middle of this pandemic? No. Bristol mayor says Colston statue WILL be fished out of docks - but says it should be put in a museum Bristol Mayor Marvin Rees said the statue was still underwater but confirmed it would be removed at some point and should be put in a museum. Around 10,000 people took part in the protest on Sunday, which was praised by the force for being 'peaceful and respectful'. Marvin Rees, the elected Labour Mayor of Bristol, praised the police's handling of the event as 'intelligent and nuanced'. Mr Rees said he could not condone the damage and was also concerned about the implications of a mass gathering in terms of the coronavirus pandemic. 'I'm the mixed race child of a Welsh-English white woman and a black Jamaican father,' he told BBC Breakfast. 'One of my ancestors would have been taken on a ship from Africa to the Caribbean. 'That statue is an affront to me and there's a plaque on it as well that describes him as a 'wise and virtuous son', so that's a double insult. 'It's not something that I as a Bristolian would have looked on with pride and it had been a point of debate in the city.' Mr Rees said Bristol only started to really discuss its relationship with slavery in a 'meaningful way' about 20 years ago and that conversation would now 'go up a few gears'. 'We have a statue up to someone who made his money buying and selling people,' he told BBC Breakfast. 'That statue is now underwater, which is a piece of poetic and historical irony because, undoubtedly, people would have been thrown off the sides of the ships during the journey themselves and there will be many African bodies on the bottom of the water.' Mr Rees said the statue would be pulled out of the harbour 'at some point' and placed in a museum. Placards from the Black Lives Matter march, which were laid around the plinth where the statue had stood, have also been collected and will be put on display. Advertisement 'Let's get this dealt with, let's make sure we're all safe in relation to Covid 19 because all lives matter, and then if you want to protest do what you want to do. 'But at the moment this is just selfish. It's not necessary. My colleagues have no choice whatsoever, they have to be there and I thought they did an incredible job over the weekend. 'The provocation was quite high to which they didn't react to. They took the abuse that was thrown at them. I don't know why they're taking this sort of abuse on the back of something that took place 5000 miles away but this is where we are. I thought they did a sterling job without fear or favour. 'The problem is now that I think people have cottoned onto the fact they can now get away with coming out onto the streets, whereas they couldn't when they were locked up at home for ten weeks. 'But the legislation is that not more than six people can gather. Is it two sets of rules? This is just ridiculous and it's putting all my colleagues at risk and I don't want my colleagues to be put at risk.' The worst of the trouble erupted outside Downing Street on Saturday evening after a largely peaceful protest over the death of African-American George Floyd, who died in U.S police custody two weeks ago. Missiles, including several flares, were hurled over security gates guarding the entrance to the Prime Minister's official residence by a crowd who had earlier chanted 'Boris Johnson's a racist'. The violence prompted officers in riot gear to intervene followed by the mounted division. In the chaos that ensued, a mounted came off her horse after colliding into traffic lights as protesters threw fireworks, bangers, bottles and at one point even a Boris Bike. Dramatic footage showed a riderless horse bolting back down Whitehall, colliding with an innocent demonstrator as it do so. The injured officer was pictured lying motionless and unconscious on the floor before she was dragged away by her colleagues. She is now stable in hospital. Mr Marsh praised the officer and said: 'She's a hero because, like my other colleagues, she put herself on the line for a protest that was unlawful, shouldn't have taken place and, by its very nature, could have caused thousands more deaths by being held in the middle of a pandemic. 'The officer is currently stable in hospital but serious injuries have been sustained, a broken collarbone, broken ribs and a collapsed lung. Not life-threatening but it will take quite a while to recover, three to four months I'd imagine. 'They are not nice injuries. Anyone who's had a broken collarbone will know that it's a horrible injury because it's one of those that's very difficult to heal. Likewise broken ribs and a collapsed lung are also horrible because there isn't anything you can prescribe for them. 'She will be alright but it's going to take a bit of time.' Warehouse worker tells how he joined four Army cadet volunteers to scrub off 'Churchill was a racist' graffiti A group of youong men of remove graffiti from a statue of Winston Churchill at Parliament Square in London this morning A group of volunteers including four Army cadets cleaned up a memorial to Winston Churchill in London this morning after it was defaced by activists during yesterday's violent Black Lives Matter protests. The men scrubbed graffiti off the statue one day after the phrase 'was racist' was added in spray paint by protesters below the wartime leader's name, leaving the monument reading: 'Churchill was a racist'. A fifth man, warehouse worker called Max, 25, who had just finished a night shift and went to Saturday's protests, also cleaned up, telling MailOnline he went there because it 'just felt like it was the right thing to do.' The volunteers, who brought their own cleaning products, only stopped and left when a professional cleaner - remarkably called Winston - also turned up this morning and said he had been asked to do the job professionally. It came as the clean-up also began in Bristol as council crews removed BLM placards and used chemicals and spray to clean graffit off the plinth from which the statue of slave trader Edward Colston was torn down yesterday. Speaking to MailOnline today, Max said: 'For me it was a decision I made last night. I worked during a long night shift and I received the news that the statue was being defaced. I just felt like it was the right thing to do. 'It was completely independent, I thought to myself I'd be the only one there. I didn't mean to antagonise or upset anyone to do it. When I got there I was pleased to see four young Army cadets already cleaning the statue. 'I did actually attend the Black Lives Matter protest on Saturday in support of the movement. I feel strongly to show solidarity. I understand the actions that carried on late into last night were that of a minority. 'But I will not have war memorials defaced. The violence and to see the anger and hatred towards the police was very, very hard to watch for me. It came to standing up for what's right.' Max added: 'We brought our own cleaning products and they weren't really up to the job. We only left because remarkably a gentleman called Winston asked us to stop because he'd been asked to do the job professionally.' Advertisement Just 24-hours after the mayhem in Westminster another Black Lives Matter protest took place in London yesterday. Thousands gathered outside the American Embassy, just south of the River Thames in Nine Elms, before heading back into Westminster, where further clashes with police took place. One officer was seen with blood pouring down his head after being hit by a traffic cone while mobile phone footage showed other officers being forced to run from a baying bottle-throwing mob. A dispersal order was enforced in Westminster until 6am this morning as riot police battled into the night to move a group of about 50 violent protesters on. Earlier in the day, Black Lives Matter protesters in Bristol had toppled a bronze statue of 17th century slave trader Edward Colston and rolled it into the harbour. The Prime Minister condemned the trouble in both cities. In a statement he said the BLM protests were 'subverted by thuggery' and that the violence was a 'betrayal' of their cause. And last night English Defence League founder Tommy Robinson blasted the 'Soft-handed' police approach for failing to protect the Cenotaph and the Sir Winston Churchill statue. He told his followers on social media that he would be heading into London on Saturday, adding: 'I cannot believe what's come of our capital city. 'Attack that statue like you did in Bristol today and think there's not going to be a British public there to confront you about it, you're wrong. 'You watch next Saturday how many people turn up.' A group called the Democratic Football Lads Alliance, made up of football fans from around Britain, has pledged to form a protective ring around London's war memorials and statues to prevent them from being damaged in protests. The clean-up began in Bristol today as council teams removed BLM placards and used chemicals to clean off graffiti defacing the plinth that held the Edward Colston statue in Bristol, and another of Winston Churchill in London. On the Colston statue, Bristol Mayor Marvin Rees said it will be fished out 'at some point' and it is 'highly likely' to end up in one of the city's museums - with a debate set to be held over what should replace it on the plinth. Speaking about the general public disorder, Home Secretary Priti Patel told Sky News: 'I think that is utterly disgraceful and that speaks to the acts of public disorder that actually have now become a distraction from the cause in which people are actually protesting about and trying to empathise and sympathise with. 'That is completely an unacceptable act and that speaks to the vandalism - again as we saw (on Saturday) in London - but sheer vandalism and disorder completely is unacceptable. And it's right the police follow up on that and make sure that justice is taken with those individuals responsible for such disorderly and lawless behaviour.' The shocking images come as global demonstrations intensify after George Floyd, a 46-year-old black man, died after police officer Derek Chauvin put his knee on his neck in Minneapolis on May 25 for nine minutes. Demonstrators flouted social distancing rules yesterday to flood the streets around the US Embassy in London before marching on Westminster, protesting against racial injustice and police brutality. While the majority of the protests remained peaceful, violence erupted yet again, with images showing police and demonstrators suffering injuries during the melee which led to 12 arrests and eight officers being injured. The Metropolitan Police confirmed the majority of the arrests had been made for public order offences and one was for criminal damage following the incident at the Cenotaph. Also yesterday, images showed Black Lives Matter protesters tearing down a statue of 17th century slave trader and philanthropist Edward Colston in Bristol and dumping it in the harbour. Footage showed demonstrators, packed closely together - despite social distancing guidelines, heaving the metal monument down with ropes before cheering and dancing around it, with many placing their knees on the fallen statue as it lay on the ground - in a nod to the death of Mr Floyd. Marvin Rees, the Mayor of Bristol, told BBC Radio Bristol today: 'It's still underwater. At some point it will (be fished out) but we've a number of priorities in the city at the moment, not least trying to face up to an £80million gap in our budget that we've been left with by national Government not funding us adequately for Covid.' He added: 'I think that there's a really incredible opportunity to talk about ourselves and to make a decision about what we think should go on a plinth in the city to tell us about who we are, not just who we are but who we want to be and to really use that as a place to celebrate something about ourselves, the best of ourselves. 'What I would look forward to is having that city discussion. In the meantime it's highly likely that the Colston statue will end up in one of our museums.' But Government minister for crime and policing Kit Malthouse told BBC Breakfast: 'A crime was committed, criminal damage was committed, there should be evidence gathered and a prosecution should follow.' 'There is an elected mayor of Bristol, there is a council in Bristol and it is via those democratic means that we will resolve these issues in this country - not by people showing up with ropes and tools and committing criminal damage. We have to have a sense of order and democracy - that is how we sort things out and that is what should have happened.' But Labour's shadow justice secretary David Lammy told ITV's Good Morning Britain: 'I do absolutely support protest in the incident of the Colston statue. This is a man who transported over 80,000 African men women and children. It's shameful, shameful - we're actually discussing whether he should have a statue. People have been calling for that statue to come down in Bristol for many years. There may be a role for statues such as this in museums where there is proper context where they can think about their contribution to society as well as what they got wrong.'

But she added: 'There are no excuses for the unlawful behaviour and disorder we have witnessed throughout the weekend including the disgraceful vandalism we saw in Bristol and the utterly appalling abuse of our police officers.' Commenting on the desecration of Churchill's statue, she added: 'Winston Churchill is one of the greatest Britons who ever lived. We have him to thank for our very freedom to protest. The vandals who did this are repulsive criminals who I want to see brought to justice immediately.' Police officers had suffered 'serious injuries' inflicted by 'a small minority of violent people using the guise of peaceful protest to pursue reckless lawlessness,' she said. She added: 'I know that the British public will be as appalled as I am at those scenes.' Outside Downing Street some demonstrators were seen turning violent as police officers tried to control the mass chaos and form a barricade with their riot shields. A group of members of the public remove graffiti from the statue of former British Prime Minister Winston Churchill today A person cleans graffiti from the statue of Winston Churchill at Parliament Square in London this morning Yesteday, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the anti-racism demonstrations had been 'subverted by thuggery' following a day of protests across the UK. He tweeted: 'People have a right to protest peacefully & while observing social distancing but they have no right to attack the police. 'These demonstrations have been subverted by thuggery - and they are a betrayal of the cause they purport to serve. Those responsible will be held to account.' Hours after the incident that saw the statue of Edward Colston pulled down in Bristol, the M6 in the Midlands was closed as Black Lives Matter protesters walked down the carriageway. A video posted on social media showed crowds of people covering the motorway at the Exhall interchange near Coventry as traffic remained stationary on the other side. Flares are launched into the air as police and demonstrators clash during Black Lives Matter protest in the nation's capital today Members of the police force attempt to disperse the crowds as a demonstrator climbs onto the national war monument in London One eyewitness claimed there were around 100 people who were heard chanting 'Black Lives Matter' as they took part in the demonstrations. Many drivers on the motorway were pictured emerging from their cars to watch the protests, which began at around 5pm, and the southbound carriageway was closed for around two hours. Today spokesperson for the protests in London, Superintendent Jo Edwards, said: 'Regrettably officers were faced with further scenes of violence and disorder following a day of predominantly peaceful protest throughout the capital. 'This is a hugely impassioned movement and we understand the public's desire to have their voices heard – however it is not right that this passion has turned into violent attacks on officers. 'I would like to thank our officers, and those from the City of London Police and British Transport Police for their professionalism in the face of entirely unacceptable behaviour. 'Overnight our policing operation will continue and I would urge demonstrators thinking of returning to stay at home. The threat of Coronavirus remains very real, and we need you to protect yourselves, your friends and your family.' As the chaos continued, one protester, who took part in defacing the statue of the former Prime Minister Winston Churchill, was heard on camera saying: 'Tagged up Churchill as a racist on the statue of Churchill because he is a confirmed racist. 'He didn't fight the Nazis for the commonwealth or for anything else or for any personal freedoms. He fought the Nazis purely to protect the commonwealth against the invasion by foreign forces. He didn't do it for black people or people of colour. He did it purely for colonialism. 'People will be angry but at the end of the day I'm angry that for many years we've been oppressed. You can't enslave people, have the largest colonial empire ever in history and they try and come like ''yeah let's be peaceful'' it don't work like that.'

In a statement yesterday the police chief said: 'I am deeply saddened and depressed that a minority of protesters became violent towards officers in central London yesterday evening. 'This led to 14 officers being injured, in addition to 13 hurt in earlier protests this week. 'We have made a number of arrests and justice will follow. I know many who were seeking to make their voices heard will be as appalled as I am by those scenes. 'I would urge protesters to please find another way to make your views heard which does not involve coming out on the streets of London, risking yourself, your families and officers as we continue to face [the deadly coronavirus].' Following the destruction of the statue in Bristol today former Chancellor of the Exchequer Sajid Javid condemned protesters' decision to force it down, declaring on Twitter: 'This is not OK'. Speaking after the demonstration, superintendent Andy Bennett vowed there would be an investigation into the 'act of criminal damage,' near Bristol Harbourside, where slave ships once docked centuries ago.

The scenes come as demonstrations continue to increase around the world after George Floyd, a 46-year-old African American man, died after police officer Derek Chauvin put his knee on his neck in Minneapolis on May 25 for nine minutes. Following the death of George Floyd, three other officers who were also present at the scene, Thomas Lane, J Alexander Kueng and Tou Thao – were charged with aiding and abetting second-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. Earlier today Health Secretary Matt Hancock said it is 'undoubtedly a risk' that there will be an increase in Covid-19 cases following the protests, as he urged people not to gather in groups of more than six people. Mr Hancock said he supported the activists' arguments, but said: 'Please don't gather in groups of more than six people because there is also a pandemic that we must address and control.'

The march began in Kenton Park on Friday, a common site for previous protests, before winding towards the Portland Police Association building. Officers reportedly used stun grenades, shot impact munitions and smoke devices to clear the demonstrators. The Oregonian reports that traces of blood were visible on the ground where officers had pinned and detained residents. \'After rocks were thrown at officers, an unlawful assembly was declared at the Portland Police Association offices in North Portland, and numerous arrests were made,\' the department said in the statement. Authorities claimed they waited 90 minutes for deescalation methods before making any arrests. Fireworks and Molotov cocktails were launched on Saturday as law enforcement and anti-racism demonstrators clashed for the 100th night in a row this year The Portland Police Bureau revealed in a press release that 27 people were arrested between Friday night and Saturday morning after protesters refused to vacate area \'Officers began to make targeted arrests and in some cases moved the crowd back and kept them out of the street. Several times officers pulled back and allowed members of the assembly an opportunity to leave,\' the statement read. According to the statement, the majority of those arrested were from Portland, but one man was from West Virginia and another from Washington state. After the riot was declared, a BLM \'snack van\' that hands out food to protesters pulled up to an intersection blocked by police and faced officers in a tense standoff. When a line of riot police charged the BLM demonstrators they scattered, and officers were filmed sprinting after the fleeing protesters down normally quiet streets lined with family homes, pinning them to the ground and cuffing them while others shouted insults and taunts. Neighbors blocked their roads with traffic cones and barrels to prevent protesters parking and joining the demonstration that devolved into a riot. A local standing outside his home told DailyMail.com that at one point a line of hundreds of marchers trooping down East Burnside Street by Ventura Park stretched almost twenty city blocks. Another resident complained on Twitter that he and his pregnant wife were forced to put on respirators in their home as the clouds of tear gas wafted into the suburban streets nearby. The Portlander tweeted at Mayor Ted Wheeler: \'I\'m at home with my pregnant wife with respirators on in our own goddamn house you son of a b****!\' \'My neighborhood is f***ing filled with smoke and my pregnant wife and I have put on respirators inside of our own damn house. I am f***ing furious right now at PPB.\' Saturday night\'s unrest came days after Michael Reinoehl, 48, was shot dead by members of a federal task force in Washington, after they attempted to apprehend him on murder charges in the killing of Aaron \'Jay\' Danielson, 39. Danielson was allegedly shot in the chest by Reinoehl after clashes between Trump supporters and Black Lives Matter protesters broke out during a rally in Portland on August 29. Pittsburgh The Mayor of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, was confronted over his city\'s policies and law enforcement at his home Saturday night by upset residents. Around 100 people met in the East Liberty neighborhood for \'Civil Saturdays,\' the name given to their continued protests, they traveled through downtown. The Post-Gazzette reports that Saturday\'s demonstration was meant to disrupt restaurant diners and residents with a call for Black Lives Matter. \'Out of the bars and into the streets,\' the group chanted.

People outside his home held signs reading \'Defund the Police\' and flashed flashlights into windows. At one point, protest leader Nique Craft stood in front of an apartment building to address residents watching the protest from their balconies. \'Four people were arrested just for doing exactly this,\' she said. Tensions flared on the trek to Peduto\'s home after one restaurant employee reportedly told members of the protest to \'go back to their own country.\' Mayor Peduto\'s home was surrounded by a line of Pittsburgh police officers who stood guard at the front door (pictured) Once outside Peduto\'s home, demonstrators were met with a half-dozen Pittsburgh police officers standing in front of the mayor\'s door. After standing there for a short time, Post-Gazzette reports that officers began putting on their riot helmets. \'I don\'t see a riot here why are you in riot gear?\' protesters chanted in response. The group eventually left Peduto\'s home and the demonstration peacefully dispersed just after 10pm. Rochester Residents in Rochester, New York, gathered for the fourth night in a row to protest the death of Daniel Prude, a 29-year-old black man who was shot seven times in the back by law enforcement. Police used batons, pepper balls and tear gas to push back about 2,000 protesters who marched toward the Public Safety Building on Saturday night, chanting \'Black Lives Matter\' and \'Daniel Prude\' - a reference to the Black man who died after an encounter with police in March. The Rochester Police Department said in a statement that protesters had ignored their orders to disperse, and that some hurled bottles, rocks and fireworks at officers. Fox News reports that 11 people and three officers were injured on Friday night as tensions flared the night before.

As the afternoon wore on, a large group of protesters marched toward the Churchill Downs track chanting \'No Justice, No Derby\' - a nod to an earlier call by activists for the historic race in Louisville, Kentucky, to be canceled. The race was being held without spectators to prevent the spread of the coronavirus. Earlier on Saturday, some of the counter-protesters outside Churchill Downs, brandishing pistols and long guns, squared off with a group of Black Lives Matter protesters and got into shoving matches. People on both sides screamed, faces inches apart. After about 45 minutes, police cleared the people from the park, but the protests outside Churchill Downs continued. The counter-protesters included about 250 pro-police demonstrators called \'The Angry Vikings,\' who were armed and dressed in tactical gear. Demonstrations against racism and police brutality have swept the United States since May 25 when George Floyd, a Black man, died after a Minneapolis police officer knelt on his neck for nearly nine minutes. Protester in Louisville, Kentucky, challenge members of a pro-Trump militia on Saturday - Derby Day for the city Heavily-armed and, in some cases, entirely masked gunmen are pictured speaking to the media in Louisville on Saturday Members of a pro-Trump militia attend the \'Patriot Gathering\' on Derby Day in Louisville, Kentucky, on Saturday A member of a militia wears a mask bearing the slogan \'We the people\' at a rally in Louisville, Kentucky on Saturday Cox Park in Louisville, Kentucky was the site of the Patriot Gathering, held to coincide with the Kentucky Derby Trump supporters are photographed in Cox Park in Louisville, Kentucky, on Saturday - Derby Day in the city Members of militias from around the country responded to a call for a \'Patriot Gathering\' in Louisville, Kentucky Members of the Three Percenters and other militia armed with assault rifles march towards Jefferson Square Park in Louisville Protesters face off with the Angry Viking, right, in Jefferson Square Park, dubbed by protesters \'Injustice Square Park\' Meanwhile, a group of about 200 members of NFAC — a black militia group which has protested against police killings of black people — had gathered at a park just outside Churchill Downs and were inspecting their weapons, with the Derby preliminaries well underway inside. Most of the NFAC militia members came from Georgia, according to a local reporter, Travis Ragsdale NFAC, which stands for \'Not F***ing Around Coalition,\' was in the city in July protesting injustice in the Breonna Taylor case. Organizers said they would return if Kentucky Attorney General Daniel Cameron didn\'t complete the investigation into Breonna Taylor\'s death. Louisville has emerged as one flashpoint in a summer of unrest due to the death of Taylor, a black 26-year-old woman who was killed when the city\'s police burst into her apartment with a \'no-knock\' arrest warrant in March. \'When they start the race, ain\'t nobody going to be enjoying themselves,\' NFAC leader John \'Grandmaster Jay\' Johnson said. \'You see, they\'re looking at us right now. They really don\'t give a damn about no race. \'Louisville, y\'all brought this on yourself.\' Johnson then led the group back to G.G. Moore Park, where the NFAC\'s march began, shortly before the running of the Derby. As the NFAC did a \'weapons check\' before the start of the march at G.G. Moore Park, WDRB reported that one of the leaders only wanted people with long weapons. \'If you\'re only carrying a pistol, you will not be allowed in this formation,\' he reportedly said. Kentucky has no restrictions on the open carrying of firearms by anyone over the age of 18 Hundreds of heavily-armed protesters descended on Louisville to demand justice for Breonna Taylor on Derby Day In Louisville, Kentucky, Derby Day saw members of the NFAC militia protest in the city against Breonna Taylor\'s killing', ""Two Federal Protective Service officers were shot - one fatally - during Friday night protests in Oakland, California, as violent protests across the US intensified over the killing of George Floyd. At least 7,500 demonstrators took to the streets in Oakland last night, clashing with police and sparking arson attacks and vandalism across the city. During the squirmish, two officers with the Federal Protective Service - a part of Homeland Securitycreated to protect government facilities - were shot. Police are investigating. 'Two Federal Protective Services officers stationed at the Oakland Downtown Federal Building suffered gunshot wounds. Unfortunately, one succumbed to his injury,' the police department told CNN. Meanwhile, a 19-year-old protester was shot dead in Detroit last night, while soldiers in North Carolina and in New York were ordered to be ready to move in within four hours and troops in Colorado and Kansas within 24 hours. Police said the man was killed after shots were fired at a crowd of people near Detroit's Greektown entertainment district last night with dozens of protesters out on the streets, but officers were not involved in the shooting. The suspect pulled up to the crowd in a Dodge Durango and fired shots at around 11.30pm, and the man was pronounced dead in hospital. No details about who fired the shots were immediately available, police said. Crowds took to the streets in the city after former officer Derek Chauvin was charged with murder over the death of Floyd, a black man who was handcuffed and pleaded for air as an officer pressed his knee on his neck. Minneapolis: Looting and fires broke out again in Minneapolis as protesters defied the state curfew and the National Guard failed to keep the city under control Portland: Policemen walk enveloped by teargas in Portland, Oregon, yesterday as violence escalated in the downtown area Over in Minneapolis, protesters have been running rampant for the past three nights in a show of outrage that has seen a suspected looter shot dead in the street, a Minneapolis police precinct stormed and set alight, and the city up in flames as businesses and stores were looted and torched. Amid fears that the chaos was entering a fourth night, Minnesota Governor Tim Walz signed an emergency order mandating that residents stay home from the hours of 8pm to 6am and giving cops the power to arrest anyone who refused to comply. Mr Walz said it was an 'incredibly dangerous, fluid and dynamic' situation, adding that he can 'fully understand the rage' but urged for calm on the streets. The state order came after the twin cities imposed curfews starting at 8p.m. Friday in efforts to bring the rioting and destruction under control. In Detroit last night, officers - many in riot gear - confronted the protesters in the Michigan city and formed lines across streets. Dozens of arrests were made and police said many were not Detroit residents. By midnight, the crowd had thinned considerably as police shot canisters of gas toward the protesters. The demonstration began earlier in the day and was peaceful as protesters marched by Detroit Police Headquarters. 'We know that the individuals from outside the city of Detroit who converged at the protest location don't represent this city,' Police Chief James Craig said. The number of arrests and injuries is not yet available. The move to put the Army on a short-term notice comes after President Donald Trump asked Defense Secretary Mark Esper for military options in tackling the escalating civil unrest spreading across America, according to sources. Overnight, Trump also commented on a tweet by Former Democrats for Trump about how Minneapolis was ruled by Democrats, saying: 'Time for a change! #2020', which was retweeted more than 25,000 times. It comes as violent protests demanding justice for Floyd spread across the US last night, with the CNN headquarters under siege in Atlanta, New York police officers fending off rioters from a police precinct in Brooklyn and the White House forced to go into lockdown as demonstrators tried to scale the walls. Looting and fires broke out again in Minneapolis as protesters defied the state curfew and the National Guard failed to keep the city under control. The protests have now reached all corners of America with break-off demonstrations springing up across states including New York, Kentucky, Texas, Georgia as the arrest of the white cop who knelt on Floyd's neck has done little to quell the anger over the black man's death. Chaos exploded in Atlanta as demonstrators stormed and destroyed the CNN headquarters and fired a smoke bomb at cops trying to form a barrier to keep them out. In New York City, shocking footage showed an NYPD officer hurling a female protester to the ground in Brooklyn, while officers defended a police precinct amid fears it would be torched. The White House was forced to go into temporary lockdown as protesters tried to scale the walls, battled with Secret Service agents and burned American flags outside the executive residence.

The get-ready orders were sent verbally Friday, after Trump asked Esper to come up with rapid deployment options if the Minneapolis protests continued to spiral out of control, according to a senior Pentagon official who was on the call. The last time the White House invoked these powers was in 1992 during the riots in Los Angeles that followed the Rodney King trial. The National Guard was activated in Georgia late Friday night with as many as 500 troops deployed to Atlanta and a state of emergency issued after rioters destroyed the CNN HQ and looted a luxury shopping mall. The CNN headquarters bore much of the brunt of the outrage as demonstrators vandalized the media firm's logo, scrawled profanities on the building and smashed up its windows.

A smoke bomb was thrown at police at one point and at least one officer was injured after they were struck by a missile of some sort. This came just hours after black CNN reporter Omar Jimenez was arrested live on air Friday morning by Minnesota State Patrol while covering the Minneapolis protests. Jimenez was put in handcuffs and led away from his team of producers this morning at 5.11am CT after the team was moved down the street by police in riot gear. According to one of his colleagues, the crew was told he was being arrested for refusing to move when he'd been told to but he was heard live on air telling officers he was with CNN.

'We have a long night ahead of us in Brooklyn. Our sole focus is deescalating this situation and getting people home safe. There will be a full review of what happened tonight. We don't ever want to see another night like this,' de Blasio tweeted. Outside the Barclays Center stadium in Brooklyn, a peaceful protest turned violent when NYPD officers sprayed mace into the crowds while demonstrators set fire to banners and pushed to break through metal barricades. The crowds moved toward the 88th precinct with officers forced to defend the station for fear of similar scenes to those seen at the precinct in Minneapolis Thursday - where cops were forced to flee when protesters stormed the building, set it alight and cut off the gas lines.

It was reported that the woman had to seek medical attention following the incident. An MTA bus driver refused to drive protesters away from the scene after police officers commandeered the vehicle and started placing arrested New Yorkers on it. This came after violent clashes broke out in Union Square in Manhattan between cops and protesters during the day. Shocking footage shows one officer beating a protester to the point that he breaks his baton on the man as other cops try to apprehend people in the crowded Manhattan area. Another clip shows officers pushing people to the ground as protesters try to help others from the grasps of the authorities. Some police can be heard telling others to back up.

Secret Service officers stopped anyone entering the White House grounds, where President Trump is currently in residence, after a demonstrator tried to scale the fence in Lafayette Park to get inside. The man was manhandled by Secret Service out of the park and taken into custody at the Treasury Annex. Crowds followed law enforcement and the man to the jail and staged another protest outside - this one calling for a medic for the man after he was seen with blood pouring down his face, sparking renewed fears over police brutality and for the safety of a man held in police custody. Secret Service agents were also seen physically pushing demonstrators back after some pushed down metal railings while a police cruiser was seen burning in the road after it was torched by rioters. As Trump sits securely locked inside the grounds, outrage continues to boil over his Tweets warning protesters that 'when the looting starts the shooting starts.'

In Minneapolis, Mayor Jacob Frey announced a nighttime curfew barring anyone other than essential workers and public safety personnel from being in public places across the city from 8p.m. through to 6 a.m. local time and lasting for the weekend. This was quickly followed by the neighboring cities of Roseville and St. Paul which declared their own emergency orders and curfews. But this failed to keep Minneapolis under control with protesters defying the curfew and convenience stores looted. With law enforcement nowhere to be seen, around 350 troops were finally sent in after midnight - hours after chaos ensued once again despite both the city and state insisting that the response would be ramped up Friday. Las Vegas: Over in Sin City, hundreds of protesters took over parts of the Las Vegas Strip Friday night Las Vegas: Demonstrators and police officers were seen in a standoff at multiple intersections of the strip where casinos continue to stay shuttered amid the coronavirus pandemic The Minneapolis Department of Public Safety said 350 troopers had been deployed to the city's 5th precinct to disperse protesters and enforce the curfew late Friday. This came after Walz on Friday admitted an 'abject failure' by law enforcement in trying to control crowds Thursday night. On Thursday, as tensions in the city boiled all day, the National Guard started putting in motion plans to intervene to help local law enforcement agencies that were struggling to cope with the mounting threat. Meanwhile, in Sin City, hundreds of protesters took over parts of the Las Vegas Strip Friday night with police confirming several arrests had been made. Demonstrators and police officers were seen in a standoff at multiple intersections of the strip where casinos continue to stay shuttered amid the coronavirus pandemic. Protests escalated in Louisville, Kentucky, as protesters demanding justice for black woman Breonna Taylor resurfaced with renewed anger over Floyd's death. Taylor was shot dead by cops in the state back in March. The EMT was hit by bullets at least eight times when three cops stormed her apartment to serve a search warrant over a narcotics investigation. No drugs were found in the home. The Hall of Justice was targeted with an attempted fire while graffiti and flag-burning was widespread across the city.

Louisville Metro Police Department said a significantly larger number of people had come out to protest Friday compared to Thursday many armed with sticks, bats, and guns. This came after seven people were shot after gunfire rung out in downtown Louisville Thursday night. In Houston, where Floyd grew up before he moved to Minneapolis for a new start in life, huge protests also erupted. The demonstration, which was organized by Black Lives Matter, saw thousands of protesters process up Main Street to City Hall shouting 'can't breathe' and 'enough is enough'.

According to the group's Facebook page, at least 1,800 people turned out, although there appeared to be far more. One protester described the death of Floyd, who lived in Houston most of his life, as a 'modern day lynching'. Rebecca Bozeman told DailyMail.com: 'Enough is enough. The people have to come out and do their part or nothing will change. 'It's been 400 years and it's still happening. We saw a modern-day lynching. It should not be happening.' Her friend Sylvia Clinton added: 'Call it what it is. He was lynched. It was a modern-day lynching.' Clinton told DailyMail.com the news today that white cop Derek Chauvin - who knelt on Floyd's neck for eight minutes until he passed out and later died - being charged with murder is not enough, as calls mount for the arrest of the other three officers involved: J Alexander Kueng, Thomas Lane and Tou Thao. Clinton said: 'It's not enough. It's not enough for me that one of the officers has been arrested. I feel they should get the remaining three accomplices. 'Call it what it is – an accomplice is someone in conjunction with a crime and I feel like that's what the three remaining officers are and it will not be justice until we see them arrested, prosecuted and found guilty.'

Bozeman said: 'We have a lot of black men in our lives: my father, my brother, her son. They're all a part of our lives. 'So when we saw George lying there like that, that could have been any one of them, any one on a daily basis. 'The fact it has taken days just to arrest one officer, that's not right. Even then, to not be sure he will be convicted of something like that… 'We should be sure. And for this to be going on for hundreds of years, at this point, enough is enough.'

Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin was arrested and charged with murder and manslaughter Friday over the death of Floyd, four days after he was seen kneeling on his neck in a video of his arrest that has sparked violent protests across the country. The 44-year-old white cop was arrested by state investigators Friday afternoon, Public Safety Commissioner John Harrington announced, as the criminal complaint revealed he kept kneeling on the black man's neck for almost 3 minutes after he fell unconscious and said 'you're talking fine' when he begged for air. Chauvin was one of four officers fired over Floyd's death earlier this week yet the other three officers continue to walk free. Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin has been taken into custody over the death of Floyd, four days after he was seen kneeling on his neck in a video of his arrest that has sparked violent protests across the country"", ""Two Federal Protective Service officers were shot - one fatally - during Friday night protests in Oakland, California, as violent protests across the US intensified over the killing of George Floyd. At least 7,500 demonstrators took to the streets in Oakland last night, clashing with police and sparking arson attacks and vandalism across the city. During the squirmish, two officers with the Federal Protective Service - a part of Homeland Securitycreated to protect government facilities - were shot. Police are investigating. 'Two Federal Protective Services officers stationed at the Oakland Downtown Federal Building suffered gunshot wounds. Unfortunately, one succumbed to his injury,' the police department told CNN. Meanwhile, a 19-year-old protester was shot dead in Detroit last night, while soldiers in North Carolina and in New York were ordered to be ready to move in within four hours and troops in Colorado and Kansas within 24 hours. Police said the man was killed after shots were fired at a crowd of people near Detroit's Greektown entertainment district last night with dozens of protesters out on the streets, but officers were not involved in the shooting. The suspect pulled up to the crowd in a Dodge Durango and fired shots at around 11.30pm, and the man was pronounced dead in hospital. No details about who fired the shots were immediately available, police said. Crowds took to the streets in the city after former officer Derek Chauvin was charged with murder over the death of Floyd, a black man who was handcuffed and pleaded for air as an officer pressed his knee on his neck. Minneapolis: Looting and fires broke out again in Minneapolis as protesters defied the state curfew and the National Guard failed to keep the city under control Portland: Policemen walk enveloped by teargas in Portland, Oregon, yesterday as violence escalated in the downtown area Over in Minneapolis, protesters have been running rampant for the past three nights in a show of outrage that has seen a suspected looter shot dead in the street, a Minneapolis police precinct stormed and set alight, and the city up in flames as businesses and stores were looted and torched. Amid fears that the chaos was entering a fourth night, Minnesota Governor Tim Walz signed an emergency order mandating that residents stay home from the hours of 8pm to 6am and giving cops the power to arrest anyone who refused to comply. Mr Walz said it was an 'incredibly dangerous, fluid and dynamic' situation, adding that he can 'fully understand the rage' but urged for calm on the streets. The state order came after the twin cities imposed curfews starting at 8p.m. Friday in efforts to bring the rioting and destruction under control. In Detroit last night, officers - many in riot gear - confronted the protesters in the Michigan city and formed lines across streets. Dozens of arrests were made and police said many were not Detroit residents. By midnight, the crowd had thinned considerably as police shot canisters of gas toward the protesters. The demonstration began earlier in the day and was peaceful as protesters marched by Detroit Police Headquarters. 'We know that the individuals from outside the city of Detroit who converged at the protest location don't represent this city,' Police Chief James Craig said. The number of arrests and injuries is not yet available. The move to put the Army on a short-term notice comes after President Donald Trump asked Defense Secretary Mark Esper for military options in tackling the escalating civil unrest spreading across America, according to sources. Overnight, Trump also commented on a tweet by Former Democrats for Trump about how Minneapolis was ruled by Democrats, saying: 'Time for a change! #2020', which was retweeted more than 25,000 times. It comes as violent protests demanding justice for Floyd spread across the US last night, with the CNN headquarters under siege in Atlanta, New York police officers fending off rioters from a police precinct in Brooklyn and the White House forced to go into lockdown as demonstrators tried to scale the walls. Looting and fires broke out again in Minneapolis as protesters defied the state curfew and the National Guard failed to keep the city under control. The protests have now reached all corners of America with break-off demonstrations springing up across states including New York, Kentucky, Texas, Georgia as the arrest of the white cop who knelt on Floyd's neck has done little to quell the anger over the black man's death. Chaos exploded in Atlanta as demonstrators stormed and destroyed the CNN headquarters and fired a smoke bomb at cops trying to form a barrier to keep them out. In New York City, shocking footage showed an NYPD officer hurling a female protester to the ground in Brooklyn, while officers defended a police precinct amid fears it would be torched. The White House was forced to go into temporary lockdown as protesters tried to scale the walls, battled with Secret Service agents and burned American flags outside the executive residence.

The get-ready orders were sent verbally Friday, after Trump asked Esper to come up with rapid deployment options if the Minneapolis protests continued to spiral out of control, according to a senior Pentagon official who was on the call. The last time the White House invoked these powers was in 1992 during the riots in Los Angeles that followed the Rodney King trial. The National Guard was activated in Georgia late Friday night with as many as 500 troops deployed to Atlanta and a state of emergency issued after rioters destroyed the CNN HQ and looted a luxury shopping mall. The CNN headquarters bore much of the brunt of the outrage as demonstrators vandalized the media firm's logo, scrawled profanities on the building and smashed up its windows.

A smoke bomb was thrown at police at one point and at least one officer was injured after they were struck by a missile of some sort. This came just hours after black CNN reporter Omar Jimenez was arrested live on air Friday morning by Minnesota State Patrol while covering the Minneapolis protests. Jimenez was put in handcuffs and led away from his team of producers this morning at 5.11am CT after the team was moved down the street by police in riot gear. According to one of his colleagues, the crew was told he was being arrested for refusing to move when he'd been told to but he was heard live on air telling officers he was with CNN.

A luxury shopping mall was also targeted by looters late into the night when some moved on from downtown Atlanta and headed north to Lenox Square Mall in Buckhead. Governor Brian Kemp activated the National Guard to the state capital late Friday as the rioting escalated.

'We have a long night ahead of us in Brooklyn. Our sole focus is deescalating this situation and getting people home safe. There will be a full review of what happened tonight. We don't ever want to see another night like this,' de Blasio tweeted. Outside the Barclays Center stadium in Brooklyn, a peaceful protest turned violent when NYPD officers sprayed mace into the crowds while demonstrators set fire to banners and pushed to break through metal barricades. The crowds moved toward the 88th precinct with officers forced to defend the station for fear of similar scenes to those seen at the precinct in Minneapolis Thursday - where cops were forced to flee when protesters stormed the building, set it alight and cut off the gas lines.

It was reported that the woman had to seek medical attention following the incident. An MTA bus driver refused to drive protesters away from the scene after police officers commandeered the vehicle and started placing arrested New Yorkers on it. This came after violent clashes broke out in Union Square in Manhattan between cops and protesters during the day. Shocking footage shows one officer beating a protester to the point that he breaks his baton on the man as other cops try to apprehend people in the crowded Manhattan area. Another clip shows officers pushing people to the ground as protesters try to help others from the grasps of the authorities. Some police can be heard telling others to back up.

Secret Service officers stopped anyone entering the White House grounds, where President Trump is currently in residence, after a demonstrator tried to scale the fence in Lafayette Park to get inside. The man was manhandled by Secret Service out of the park and taken into custody at the Treasury Annex. Crowds followed law enforcement and the man to the jail and staged another protest outside - this one calling for a medic for the man after he was seen with blood pouring down his face, sparking renewed fears over police brutality and for the safety of a man held in police custody. Secret Service agents were also seen physically pushing demonstrators back after some pushed down metal railings while a police cruiser was seen burning in the road after it was torched by rioters. As Trump sits securely locked inside the grounds, outrage continues to boil over his Tweets warning protesters that 'when the looting starts the shooting starts.'

In Minneapolis, Mayor Jacob Frey announced a nighttime curfew barring anyone other than essential workers and public safety personnel from being in public places across the city from 8p.m. through to 6 a.m. local time and lasting for the weekend. This was quickly followed by the neighboring cities of Roseville and St. Paul which declared their own emergency orders and curfews. But this failed to keep Minneapolis under control with protesters defying the curfew and convenience stores looted. With law enforcement nowhere to be seen, around 350 troops were finally sent in after midnight - hours after chaos ensued once again despite both the city and state insisting that the response would be ramped up Friday. Las Vegas: Over in Sin City, hundreds of protesters took over parts of the Las Vegas Strip Friday night Las Vegas: Demonstrators and police officers were seen in a standoff at multiple intersections of the strip where casinos continue to stay shuttered amid the coronavirus pandemic The Minneapolis Department of Public Safety said 350 troopers had been deployed to the city's 5th precinct to disperse protesters and enforce the curfew late Friday. This came after Walz on Friday admitted an 'abject failure' by law enforcement in trying to control crowds Thursday night. On Thursday, as tensions in the city boiled all day, the National Guard started putting in motion plans to intervene to help local law enforcement agencies that were struggling to cope with the mounting threat. Meanwhile, in Sin City, hundreds of protesters took over parts of the Las Vegas Strip Friday night with police confirming several arrests had been made. Demonstrators and police officers were seen in a standoff at multiple intersections of the strip where casinos continue to stay shuttered amid the coronavirus pandemic. Protests escalated in Louisville, Kentucky, as protesters demanding justice for black woman Breonna Taylor resurfaced with renewed anger over Floyd's death. Taylor was shot dead by cops in the state back in March. The EMT was hit by bullets at least eight times when three cops stormed her apartment to serve a search warrant over a narcotics investigation. No drugs were found in the home. The Hall of Justice was targeted with an attempted fire while graffiti and flag-burning was widespread across the city.

Tens of thousands of Muslims demonstrated Friday across the Middle East in support of the Palestinians and against the intensifying Israeli bombardment of Gaza, underscoring the risk of a wider regional conflict as Israel prepares for a possible ground invasion. From the typically sedate streets of downtown Amman in Jordan, to Yemen's war-scarred capital of Sanaa, crowds of Muslim worshippers poured into the streets after weekly Friday prayers, angered by devastating Israeli airstrikes on Gaza that began after the militant group Hamas launched an unprecedented surprise attack on Israel last Saturday. Thousands of demonstrators gathered Friday in Tahrir Square in the centre of Baghdad, and similar protests have been held in Lebanon and other Arab countries following afternoon prayers. During some of the protests - like in Iran, Bangladesh and Malaysia - angry demonstrators burned Israeli and American flags. In Beirut, thousands of Hezbollah supporters waved Hezbollah and Palestinian flags while holding pictures of burning Israeli ones. And in Berlin, home to one of the largest Palestinian diasporas outside the Middle East, pro-Palestinian protesters clashed with riot police, with one bloodied demonstrator being led away from a square in the German capital. Thousands more gathered in the Jordanian capital of Amman on Friday for a demonstration in support of Palestinians, with many holding banners reading: 'The victory march will continue, solidarity with Palestine' and 'Stand with Palestine, Liberated Palestine'.

'[We must] head to the squares and streets of the Arab and Islamic world on Friday,' Meshaal, who currently heads Hamas's diaspora office, said yesterday. The former terror leader, who is based in Qatar, said the governments and peoples of Jordan, Syria, Lebanon and Egypt have a bigger duty to support the Palestinians in comments recorded earlier this week. Jordan and Lebanon are home to the largest number of Palestinian refugees. In Baghdad, tens of thousands gathered in Tahrir Square in the centre of Iraq's capital today for protests called by the influential Shiite cleric and political leader Muqtada al-Sadr. Giant Palestinian flags were seen laid on the ground alongside the flag of Iraq in a sign of solidarity as the Israeli flag was set alight. Demonstrators at the rally chanted: 'No to the occupation! No to America!' 'May this demonstration... terrify the great evil, America, which supports Zionist terrorism against our loved ones in Palestine,' al-Sadr said in an online statement. 'This rally is aimed at condemning what is happening in occupied Palestine, the bloodletting and the violation of rights,' said Abu Kayan, an organiser of the protest. In Tokyo, Muslims were embroiled in a standoff with police as they protested on the streets outside of the Israeli embassy in the city. Less than 24 hours earlier, pro-Israel supporters were peacefully singing in Hebrew outside of the same building. Across Iran, a supporter of Hamas and Israel's regional archenemy, demonstrators protested. In Tehran, the country's capital, they burned Israeli and Ameircan flags, chanting: 'Death to Israel,' 'Death to America,' 'Israel will be doomed,' and 'Palestine will be the conqueror.' 'The Palestinian people are fed up, now your idea is to destroy Gaza, the houses of the people,' Iran's hard-line President Ebrahim Raisi said in a speech in the country's southern Fars province. 'The people of the world and Palestine will cause trouble for you.' Tehran's state television described the Iranian rallies as 'screams of a common pain... The pain of the Zionist regime's (Israel) trampling on humanity'. Meanwhile, Jordanian riot police on Friday forcibly dispersed hundreds of pro-Palestinian protesters trying to reach a border zone with the Israeli-occupied West Bank as thousands held anti-Israel demonstrations across the country, witnesses said. More than 10,000 people gathered in central Amman, near the Grand Husseini Mosque, after a call for protests from the Jordanian Muslim Brotherhood, and several leftist and youth groups. Jordan is worried that a regional widening of violence arising from the war between Israel and Palestinian Islamist group Hamas in Gaza could have repercussions for itself given that a large percentage of its population are Palestinians. The nation lost the West Bank including East Jerusalem to Israel in the 1967 Middle East war and the Palestinian territory was seeing a rise in violence between Palestinians and the Israeli military and settlers even before the Gaza conflict erupted. Witnesses said police fired tear gas to halt about 500 demonstrators who had reached a security checkpoint outside the capital Amman on a highway leading to a main border crossing. Hamas leader Khaled Meshaal's call for Muslims to 'take the streets' in the wake of the terror group's brutal assault on Israel has resulted in worldwide protests IRAQ: On Friday, photos and videos posted on X showed thousands of Iraqis flooding Baghdad's Tahir Square in support of Hamas IRAQ: People gather next to burning Israeli flags as supporters of Iraqi Shi'ite cleric Moqtada al-Sadr gather during a protest in solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza in Baghdad on Friday IRAQ: Supporters of Iraqi Shi'ite cleric Moqtada al-Sadr gather during a protest in solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza in Baghdad on Friday IRAQ: Thousands of protesters gather during a protest in solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza, in Baghdad on Friday IRAQ: An aerial view of the demonstration in support of pro-Palestine at the al-Tahrir Square in Baghdad, Iraq on Friday IRAQ: Supporters of Iraqi Shi'ite cleric Moqtada al-Sadr gather for mass Friday prayer during a protest in solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza, in Baghdad on Friday IRAQ: Iraqis burn Israeli flags during a mass rally in support of the Palestinians in the Gaza Strip in Baghdad on Friday IRAQ: An aerial view of the demonstration in support of pro-Palestine at the al-Tahrir Square in Baghdad on Friday IRAQ: People stand next to fire as supporters of Iraqi Shi'ite cleric Moqtada al-Sadr gather during a protest in solidarity with Palestinians in Baghdad on Friday The interior ministry had issued a ban against holding anti-Israel marches in the sensitive border area, where it said the Jordan river valley was closed to protesters but that licensed protests elsewhere would be allowed. The outpouring of Arab anger against Israel over its siege and bombardment of Gaza retaliating for a devastating cross-border Hamas attack also fuelled a large rally on Friday in downtown Amman and in many of the kingdom's main cities. It comes after Meshaal said yesterday: 'Tribes of Jordan, sons of Jordan, brothers and sisters of Jordan... This is a moment of truth and the borders are close to you, you all know your responsibility. 'To all scholars who teach jihad... to all who teach and learn, this is a moment for the application (of theories).' Today, several thousand protesters near downtown Amman chanted slogans in support of Hamas and demanded the government close the Israeli embassy and scrap the 1994 peace treaty with Israel. In the cities of Irbid and Zarqa, thousands took to the streets carrying Hamas flags, vowing revenge against Israel and calling on the terrorists to escalate strikes. The peace treaty remains widely unpopular among Jordanians who see normalisation with Israel as a sellout of the rights of their Palestinian brethren seeking to establish a state in Israeli-occupied territories. The Israeli embassy, where protesters gather daily, has long been a flashpoint of anti-Israel protests at times of turmoil in the Palestinian territories.

Hundreds of people then joined a protest march, some of them waving Palestinian flags and others stamping on Israeli and US emblems that were laid on the ground. And in the Saudi capital Riyadh, where protests are prohibited, an AFP journalist witnessed police cuffing a worshipper who interrupted Friday prayers by shouting at the imam: 'Speak about Palestine! Gaza is under bombs!' Meanwhile in Lebanon, thousands of supporters of Iran-backed Hezbollah rallied in the southern suburbs of Beirut in support of the Palestinians. The protesters waved Lebanese, Palestinian and Hezbollah flags, chanting slogans in support of Gaza and calling for 'death to Israel.' At the event, Hezbollah deputy chief Naim Qassem said Hezbollah would be 'fully prepared' to join its ally Hamas in the war against Israel when the time is right. The Iranian-backed terrorist group in neighbouring Lebanon has launched sporadic attacks since the Hamas assault, but largely stayed on the sidelines of the war. Qassem said major powers, Arab countries and the UN had 'directly and indirectly' told Hezbollah 'not to interfere' in ongoing fighting between Israel and Hamas. Despite the warnings, the leader of the powerful Iran-backed Lebanese group - which has already clashed with Israeli forces in recent days - said it was 'ready' and would 'contribute' to confrontations against its southern neighbour. Qassem's comments came as Israel's defence minister Yoav Gallant this afternoon called Hamas, Hezbollah and Iran an 'axis of evil'. 'Iran, Hezbollah and Hamas is one axis, an axis of evil. Everything is decided generally from Iran,' he said.

'When the time is right to take action, we will do so.' In Yemen's Sanaa, held by the Iranian-backed Houthi rebels still at war with a Saudi-led coalition, live television footage showed demonstrators crowding streets and waving Yemeni and Palestinian flags. The rebels' slogan long has been: 'God is the greatest; death to America; death to Israel; curse of the Jews; victory to Islam.' After prayers in Islamabad, Pakistan's capital, some worshippers stepped on American and Israeli flags, in a sign of disrespect. Protests there broke up peacefully, though other larger ones were expected later in the day. 'Stop bombing Palestine!' shouted one of the demonstrators, Ahmed Raza. 'Stop killing innocent Palestinians!' Political and religious parties staged dozens of small demonstrations across the cities of Karachi, Lahore, Peshawar, and the capital Islamabad, where US and Israeli flags were burned. 'There is so much tyranny meted out to Palestinians, nobody can tolerate it. It is a waste of life if we don't stand by the righteous,' said Tahira Khan, a 50-year-old designer who joined one of several protests in Karachi attended by around 2,000 people. Protester Shahid Husain, 47, said the leaders of Muslim nations were failing to stand up for Palestinians.

A few hundred people also gathered in the Afghan cities of Kabul and Jalalabad for pro-Palestinian rallies organised by Taliban authorities. 'Palestine you are not alone, we are with you,' one speaker told the crowd. 'We are poor, but we will do whatever we can. We can't do much today but use our feet and stand in your support.' At the weekend, Hamas gunmen killed more than 1,300 people in Israel in the deadliest attack since the country's creation in 1948. They seized around 150 hostages - including dozens of Israelis, dual and foreign nationals - whom Hamas is threatening to kill. Israel has retaliated by raining air and artillery strikes in Gaza for six days, claiming more than 1,500 lives and displacing over 400,000 people in the crowded enclave. Meanwhile at the Al-Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem, Israeli police had been permitting only older men, women and children to the sprawling hilltop compound for prayers, trying to prevent the potential for violence as tens of thousands attend on a typical Friday. Police allowed just a Palestinian teenage girl and her mother into the compound out of 20 worshippers who tried to get in, some of them even over the age of 50.

'We can't live, we can't breathe, they are killing everything that is good within us,' said Ahmad Barbour, a 57-year-old cleaner in a clean white thobe, seething after police blocked him from entering for prayers. 'Everything that is forbidden to us is allowed to them,' he added, referring to Israelis. The mosque sits in a hilltop compound sacred to both Jews and Muslims, and conflicting claims over it have spilled into violence before. Al-Aqsa is the third-holiest site in Islam and stands in a spot known to Jews as the Temple Mount, which is the holiest site in Judaism. Police later fired tear gas in the Old City and east Jerusalem. The Palestinian Red Crescent said its medics treated six wounded people, with at least one beaten up by officers, the organization said. Meshaal's call for a Friday 13th uprising was reiterated by Hamas itself, according to the Israeli-run, Washington DC-based Middle East Media Research Institute (MEMRI).

The phrase Israel's most wanted man used in an audio tape broadcast as Hamas fired thousands of rockets out of the Gaza Strip over the weekend signalled the attack was their payback for Israeli raids at Jerusalem's Al Aqsa mosque. 'We declare next Friday, ''The Friday of the Al-Aqsa Flood,'' as a day of general mobilization in our Arab and Islamic world and among the free people of the world,' Meshaal's statement said. 'It is a day to rally support, offer aid, and participate actively. It is a day to expose the crimes of the occupation, isolate it, and foil all its aggressive schemes. It is a day to demonstrate our love for Palestine, Jerusalem, and Al-Aqsa. 'It is a day for sacrifice, heroism, and dedication, and to earn the honour of defending the first Qibla of Muslims, the third holiest mosque, and the ascension of the trusted Messenger.' JORDAN: Thousands of protesters take to the streets of Amman to express solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza on Friday JORDAN: Jordanians gather to express solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza, in Amman on Friday JORDAN: Jordanians gather to express solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza, in Amman on Friday JORDAN: Jordanians march from Grand Husseini Mosque to Al-Nahl Square after the Friday prayer, in solidarity with Palestinians in Amman on Friday Israel's Defence Forces have said they want to completely strip Hamas of its power to govern in Palestine after what has been described as the country's 'worst day in history' with the number of Israeli's killed in the conflict set to rise further. In response to the barbaric attacks, which has seen 1,300 Israelis massacred including pregnant women and children, Israel has launched a relentless barrage of airstrikes that have obliterated entire neighbourhoods in Gaza and killed 1,530 Palestinians. The Israeli airstrikes have so far flattened much of the town of Beit Hanoun in the Palestinian enclave's north-east corner, which Hamas terrorists had been using as a staging ground for their attacks. And in a sign that Israel has no notion of stopping its airstrikes, the IDF today issued an evacuation order directly on Friday morning, telling the 1.1 million people living north of an area called Wadi Gaza to move south. This would mean the entire population of Gaza City and its surroundings fleeing their homes. The UN says it is impossible to move that many people without devastating humanitarian consequences, and has urged Israel to rescind the order.

But Palestinians are preparing for a ground offensive of unprecedented scale on the tiny, crowded enclave, exceeding previous bouts of destructive warfare. Palestine's health minister also warned that Gaza is facing a humanitarian and health catastrophe and urged all countries and human rights groups to help with the immediate entry of medical and emergency aid to the enclave. Meanwhile, Arab League chief Ahmed Abul Gheit branded the Israeli order a 'forced transfer' that he said constitutes a 'crime', while the secretary general of the pan-Arab body, in a letter sent to UN chief Antonio Guterres, accused Israel of carrying out 'an atrocious act of revenge... punishing helpless civilians in Gaza'.

'Thirteen prisoners... including foreigners' were killed in five locations targeted by Israeli fighter jets, Hamas's armed wing said Friday. Israel's military sent one evacuation order directly on Friday morning, telling the 1.1 million people living north of an area called Wadi Gaza to move south. This would mean the entire population of Gaza City and its surroundings fleeing their homes. According to translations of the IDF flyers online, the army told residents that 'terrorist organisations have started the war against the State of Israel.' As a result, it said 'Gaza City has become a battlefield' and told residents they had to evacuate 'Punik immediately and go to the south of the Gaza Valley.' It also issued a stark warning to Palestinians not to try and cross into Israel.

'Generally and well-known shelters in Gaza City must be evacuated. It is forbidden to approach the security wall, and everyone who is approaching exposes himself to death.' A small map was also printed on the bottom of the flyer, with arrows pointing from the north of Gaza to the south, showing the 1.1 million Palestinians which way to flee. The Israeli military had said it would operate with 'significant force' in Gaza in the coming days amid fears of a huge ground offensive. Spokesman Jonathan Conricus said Israeli forces 'will make extensive efforts to avoid harming civilians'. He added: 'Out of an understanding that there are civilians here who are not our enemy and we do not want to target them, we are asking them to evacuate.' But the UN has said it is impossible to move that many people without devastating humanitarian consequences, and has urged Israel to rescind the order. Suffering in Gaza has been rising dramatically with Palestinians desperate for food, fuel and medicine and the territory's only power plant shut down for lack of fuel. The morgue at Gaza's biggest hospital overflowed as bodies came in faster than relatives could claim them.

The Hamas Authority for Refugee Affairs called on residents of the north of the territory to 'remain steadfast in your homes and to stand firm in the face of this disgusting psychological war waged by the occupation'. The flurry of directives was taken as signalling an already expected Israeli ground offensive, though the Israeli military has not yet confirmed such a decision. On Thursday it said that while it was preparing, no official decision has been made. Any ground offensive would be the strongest response yet to Hamas' shock assault, and would likely bring even higher casualties on both sides in brutal guerrilla warfare as Israeli soldiers go house-to-house and hunt down Hamas terrorists. 'This evacuation is for your own safety,' the Israeli military said, in a warning it said was sent to all Gaza City civilians.' Suffering in Gaza has risen dramatically with Palestinians desperate for food, fuel and medicine, while the territory's only power plant shut down for lack of fuel.

The war has claimed at least 2,800 lives on both sides since Hamas launched an incursion on October 7. Inas Hamdan, an officer at the UN Palestinian refugee agency in Gaza City, said: 'This is chaos, no-one understands what to do.' She said all the UN staff in Gaza City and northern Gaza had been told to evacuate south to Rafah. Nebal Farsakh, a spokesperson for the Palestinian Red Crescent in Gaza City, claimed there was no way more than one million people could be safely moved within the timeframe specified, saying: 'Forget about food, forget about electricity, forget about fuel. The only concern now is just if ... you're going to live.' She added: 'What will happen to our patients? We have wounded, we have elderly, we have children who are in hospitals.' The flurry of directives was taken as signalling an expected Israeli ground offensive, though the Israeli military has not yet confirmed such a decision. On Thursday it said that while it was preparing, no decision has been made.

At least 1,500 Palestinians have been killed in the indiscriminate bombing campaigns, and Israel has also traded barbs with Lebanon's Hezbollah group. Human Rights Watch said it verified videos taken in Lebanon on Oct. 10 and Gaza on Oct. 11 showing 'multiple airbursts of artillery-fired white phosphorus over the Gaza City port and two rural locations along the Israel-Lebanon border'. White phosphorus munitions can legally be used on battlefields to make smoke screens, generate illumination, mark targets or burn bunkers and buildings. Because it has legal uses, white phosphorus is not banned as a chemical weapon under international conventions - but it can cause serious burns and start fires. White phosphorous is considered an incendiary weapon under Protocol III of the Convention on the Prohibition of Use of Certain Conventional Weapons, which prohibits using incendiary weapons against military targets located among civilians, although Israel has not signed it and is not bound by it. 'White phosphorous is unlawfully indiscriminate when airburst in populated urban areas, where it can burn down houses and cause egregious harm to civilians,' Human Rights Watch said on Thursday. Asked for comment on the allegations, Israel's military said it was 'currently not aware of the use of weapons containing white phosphorous in Gaza.' It did not provide comment on the rights watchdog's allegations of their use in Lebanon. Palestinian TV channels have broadcast video in recent days showing thin plumes of white smoke lining the sky over Gaza that they say was caused by such munitions. Israel's military in 2013 said it was phasing out white phosphorus smokescreen munitions used during its 2008-2009 offensive in Gaza, which drew war crimes allegations from various rights groups. The military at the time did not say whether it would also review use of weaponised white phosphorus, which is designed to incinerate enemy positions."", ""Nine police officers were injured and missiles were thrown amid efforts to disperse pro-Palestine protesters outside the Israeli Embassy in London on Saturday. Thousands of people marched through the capital on Saturday to the gates of the embassy in Kensington, while protests took place in other cities across the UK and Ireland in solidarity with the people of Palestine. The Metropolitan Police said nine people were arrested on suspicion of violent disorder in London, and a further four were arrested on suspicion of breaching the Health Protection Regulations. The force said small pockets of disorder had followed a largely peaceful demonstration. Protesters were seen scaling buildings, climbing on the gates of Kensington palace, setting off fireworks and clambering to the top of traffic lights outside the embassy. A video showed that some clashed with police, with one officer shown on the ground injured while another man was arrested. A separate video showed people throwing drinks at officers stationed at the palace gates. Meanwhile, in Paris protesters defied a strict order against large gatherings to express their anger over the treatment of the Palestinian people. Riot police reacted with force, spraying desperate Parisians with water cannons to try to dispel the crowds. In Birmingham hundreds of demonstrators descended on the city centre today in support of Palestine amid escalating violence between the Arab state and Israel. Organisers in London say 'immediate action' is needed by the UK Government to help end the 'brutal' violence against the Palestinian people. Former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn told the crowds international action provides 'succour, comfort and support' to those suffering in the conflict. Crowds chanted 'oh, Jeremy Corbyn' and threw roses as he took to the stage. Nine police officers were injured and missiles were thrown amid efforts to disperse pro-Palestine protesters outside the Israeli Embassy in London on Saturday.

Thousands of people marched through the capital on Saturday to the gates of the embassy in Kensington, while protests took place in other cities across the UK and Ireland in solidarity with the people of Palestine Nine people were arrested on suspicion of violent disorder in London, the Metropolitan Police said. Pictured: Metropolitan Police arrest a pro-Palestinian demonstrator outside the Israeli Embassy in central London on Saturday, May 15, 2021 Other speakers outside the Israeli embassy were Labour MP Zarah Sultana and rapper Lowkey. The names and ages of the children killed in the conflict were read out, followed by a minute's silence. People were told to move further down the road as a matter of crowd safety, and there were cheers as organisers told them the turnout was 'the biggest pro-Palestine demonstration since 2014'. Organisers said demonstrator numbers were estimated at 150,000. Coloured smoke was set off along Kensington High Street and some demonstrators climbed on to buildings and bus stops. Among the buildings to be scaled were the offices of the MailOnline, where protesters climbed on scaffolding and set off fireworks. It comes as thousands of Palestinians have been forced to flee from their homes after a week of sustained conflict. Since Monday night, Palestinian militant group Hamas has fired hundreds of rockets into Israel, whose military responded by barraging the Gaza Strip with tank fire and air strikes. At least 126 people have been killed in Gaza, including 31 children and 20 women. In Israel eight people have been killed, including a six-year-old boy and a soldier.

'It's our global voices that will give succour, comfort and support in those settlements alongside Gaza and all over the West Bank, East Jerusalem who are suffering at this time. 'End the occupation now. End all the settlements now and withdraw then. End the siege of Gaza now.' Husam Zumlot, Palestinian ambassador to the UK, told crowds: 'This time is different. This time we will not be denied any more. We are united. We have had enough of oppression. Today we are saying enough, enough with the complicity. Thank you for standing with us.' The crowd stretched back to Bayswater Road from Kensington High Street. Former shadow home secretary Diane Abbott told crowds they were part of a 'worldwide movement for justice'. 'We must remember we are part of an international movement,' she said. 'This is a worldwide movement for justice. Palestinian people are having their land seized... and they are now being killed in their homes. All of this is illegal.'

It is estimated up to one thousand people filed down crowded streets from Victoria Square to the Bull Ring. Saturday is the Palestinian Nakba day, which marks the anniversary of the expulsion of hundreds of thousands of Arabs from their homes more than 70 years ago. The Birmingham protests came after an Israeli rocket destroyed a media building in Gaza and an Israeli airstrike hit a Gaza refugee camp, killing ten people, including eight children. Hamas responded with a barrage of rockets on Israeli cities, killing one person in Tel Aviv. Violence between the neighbours erupted following the eviction of Arabs from the Sheikh Jarrah neighbourhood in East Jerusalem. Earlier in the afternoon, demonstrators in London marched from Marble Arch Station to the Israeli embassy, holding banners and chanting. The Metropolitan Police said: 'Officers are engaging with a group of people who have gathered for a demonstration in central London this afternoon. 'A policing plan is in place to ensure everybody is kept safe and to reduce the spread of Covid-19.' It comes amid reports an Israeli air strike destroyed a high-rise building that housed the AP, Al-Jazeera and other media in the Gaza Strip. The AP said the air strike came roughly an hour after the Israeli military ordered people to evacuate the building. Demonstrators walk through Hyde Park as they make their way to the Israeli embassy in London, during a march in solidarity with the people of Palestine amid the ongoing conflict with Israel Protesters at a rally to express solidarity with Palestine at Marble Arch on May 15 in London after several Israeli cities experienced clashes between Jewish and Arab mobs in recent days Among those expected to address the crowds are former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, Diane Abbott and Zarah Sultana. It comes as thousands of Palestinians have been forced to flee from their homes after a week of sustained conflict The news agency said there was no immediate explanation as to why the building was targeted. The demonstration in London was organised by Palestine Solidarity Campaign, Friends of Al-Aqsa, Palestinian Forum in Britain, Stop The War Coalition, Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament and the Muslim Association of Britain. A spokesperson for the organisers said: 'It is vital that the UK Government takes immediate action. It must stop allowing Israel's brutal violence against and oppression of the Palestinian people to go unpunished. 'The bombardment of Gaza which is killing civilians including children is a war crime. The UK Government is complicit in these acts as long as it continues to offer Israel military, diplomatic and financial support.' It comes after a week of rising tensions, when Israel on Thursday pressed ahead with a fierce military offensive in the Gaza Strip, killing as many as 11 senior Hamas military figures and toppling a pair of high-rise towers housing Hamas facilities in a series of airstrikes. The Islamic militant group showed no signs of backing down and fired hundreds of rockets at Israeli cities, including heavily populated Tel Aviv and Jerusalem. Palestinian militants have stockpiled enough missiles to continue bombing Israel for the next two months, security experts have warned, as escalating fighting led the UN to warn of 'all-out war'. PARIS: Marches in support of Palestinians in the Gaza Strip were also held today in a dozen French cities, but the focus was on Paris, where riot police got ready as organizers said they would defy a ban on the protest.

The conflict sparked hundreds of demonstrators across the US Wednesday. In Downtown Chicago, a rally organized by the Chicago Coalition for Justice in Palestine, drew a crowd of nearly 1,000 protestors who said Palestinians were being mistreated. One woman held sign that said: 'Free Palestine!' In New York, protesters clashed in Times Square, with both sides screaming at each other and separated by barricades. Pro-Israel supporters could be seen draped in flags. In Cleveland, an Israel supporter asked people not to forget the people suffering in that country, even though he said Palestinians are made out to be the victims. And in Los Angeles, pro-Israel demonstrators gathered in front of the city's federal building; the prior day in the city there had been skirmishes between the factions, but photos from the scene showed only Israel supporters waving American and Israel flags. A protester wears a mask with the Palestinian flag painted on it as demonstrators marched through Hyde Park Flares were set off as the march continued through Hyde Park en route to the Israeli embassy Protesters held white roses and draped themselves in the Palestinian flag as they marched on Saturday Hundreds of people joined the protest as demonstrators marched in solidarity with the Palestinian people Demonstrators started gathering outside Marble Arch Station at midday for the march on Saturday Marches in support of Palestinians in the Gaza Strip were also held today in a dozen French cities, but the focus was on Paris, where riot police got ready as organizers said they would defy a ban on the protest. Paris police chief Didier Lallement ordered shops closed around the starting point of the planned march in a working-class neighbourhood in northern Paris after an administrative court confirmed the ban. Authorities noted a banned July 2014 pro-Palestinian protest against an Israeli offensive in Gaza that degenerated into violence and running battles with police to justify the order against Saturday's march. Pictured: Israeli boy, five, killed by Hamas rocket shrapnel A five-year-old boy killed in Israel by rocket fire from Gaza has been pictured, after he became one of the country's seven victims of the latest cross-border conflict. Ido Avigal was fatally stuck by shrapnel after the building he was in with his mother was hit by a missile on Wednesday night. In the building, found in the town of Sderot on the border with Gaza, seven people were hurt when it suffered a direct hit from a rocket. Ido Avigal, who was killed in his home in Sderot by a rocket fired from Gaza on May 12, 2021. Avigal was pronounced dead several hours later, becoming the seventh Israeli victim of the cross border conflict that started earlier this week The boy's mother grabbed him and took him into a fortified room when the in-coming rocket sirens sounded, according to local Hebrew media reports cited by the Times of Israel. However, in a rare tragedy, shrapnel from the rocket punctured the shelter's window, critically wounding the boy and also injuring his mother. Avigal was pronounced dead several hours later, becoming the seventh Israeli victim of the cross border conflict that started earlier this week. Advertisement Organizers said they intend to 'denounce the latest Israeli aggressions' and mark the fleeing of Palestinians after Israel declared independence in 1948. In Israel heightened tensions led to street brawls in areas populated by Jews and Arabs, with an Arab man dragged from his car and beaten by Jewish ultranationalists in one attack, while in another a Jewish citizen was attacked by sticks and stones by Arab Israeli protesters. At least 122 people have been killed in Gaza since violence escalated on Monday, according to the enclave's health ministry. Eight people have been killed in Israel, medical officials said. One of the Israelis - a five-year-old boy named Ido Avigal - was killed by shrapnel on Wednesday night in the Gaza border town of Sderot when rockets struck the building he was living in with his mother. Britain's Boris Johnson led international leaders in calling for the two sides to step back from the brink, but a UN Security Council meeting failed to agree on a joint statement due to opposition from the United States, Israel's key ally, diplomats said. Pleas for calm appeared in vain as Israeli and Palestinian leaders traded blood-curdling threats and further rocket strikes, with a rocket setting off alarms in the north of Israel in the early hours of Thursday morning - some 62 miles North of Gaza - sending thousands of Israelis to shelters. And after a senior Hamas commander was killed Wednesday, the Islamist militant group responded with a barrage of rockets into southern Israel which rescue workers said killed a six-year-old boy. Israel's defence minister Benny Gantz vowed more attacks on Gaza to bring 'total, long-term quiet' before they would consider truce talks after six days of violence. Prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu said his military would only use 'increasing force' in the conflict. 'We eliminated senior Hamas commanders and this is just the beginning,' he said. 'We will inflict blows on them that they couldn't even dream of.' The leader of Hamas Ismail Haniyeh hit back, vowing that 'if Israel wants to escalate, we are ready for it'. Six high-ranking commanders and a further five key Hamas figures were 'neutralised' on Wednesday, including Brigadier General Bassem Issa and Jamal Zabda, head of the group's rocket unit, according to the Israeli Defence Force (IDF). On Tuesday, Mr Johnson tweeted a plea for both sides to 'step back from the brink' and 'show restraint'. He added: 'The UK is deeply concerned by the growing violence and civilian casualties and we want to see an urgent de-escalation of tensions.' His calls were backed up by similar messages from the EU, the US, Russia and Turkey. The UN's Middle East peace envoy Tor Wennesland warned the latest violence was 'escalating towards a full-scale war'. And UN secretary-general Antonio Guterres said he was 'gravely concerned' by the ongoing troubles. Hamas and Islamic Jihad fired more than 1,000 missiles in the first 48 hours of the conflict which began on Monday, an average of one every three minutes, and has enough to keep the bombardment going for two months. Israeli military spokesman Lt Col Jonathan Conricus said: 'According to our estimates we're talking about between 20,000 and 30,000 rockets in Gaza today, rockets and mortars. 'We've seen a constant expansion in terms of range and also in terms of the size of the warheads. They have an advanced arsenal of rockets, I think it's on a par with the fire capabilities of a few small European countries.' Six high-ranking commanders and a further five key Hamas figures were 'neutralised' on Wednesday, including Brigadier General Bassem Issa and Jamal Zabda, head of the group's rocket unit, according to the Israeli Defence Force (IDF) While Israel's Iron Dome aerial defence system has intercepted nine out of ten Palestinian rockets, the remainder have killed at least six civilians and injured more than 90. Families in Tel Aviv have taken cover in underground shelters. Israel's retaliation has included hundreds of air strikes on Gaza, led by F-35 stealth bombers and Apache attack helicopters, which are understood to have killed 32 and wounded more than 300. Israel says most of the dead were terrorists and insists the children killed were victims of stray Palestinian rockets. The UN security council met Tuesday to discuss the crisis. The heaviest offensive between Israel and Hamas since a 2014 war in the Hamas-ruled enclave has increased international concern that the situation could spiral out of control. 'Israel has gone crazy,' said a man on a Gaza street, where people ran out of their homes as explosions rocked buildings. Israel's army last week said it had received a rocket warning in the north of the country, the first time the alert has been given there since hostilities soared between Israel and Palestinians earlier this week. The approximately 1,500 rockets fired from Gaza by Hamas militants since Monday had so far set off warnings in southern and central Israel, but not in the north, the army said. However in the small hours of the morning of May 6, alarms not only sounded in the economic capital Tel Aviv in the middle of the country - where residents rushed to shelters - but also in Jezreel Valley in the north. There was no immediate word of a rocket strike or casualties in Nahalal, some 100 km (62 miles) from Gaza."", ""Boris Johnson has condemned acts of 'shameful racism' after a convoy of cars bearing Palestinian flags drove through a Jewish community in north London while the passengers screamed 'f*** their mothers, f*** their daughters'. Metropolitan Police confirmed that four arrests were made after one of the cars was stopped at around 6.30pm on Sunday. Footage on social media had showed the vehicles passing down Finchley Road with passengers heard to shout offensive language and threats against Jews. Onlookers were left horrified after the convoy yelled: 'F*** the Jews... F*** all of them. F*** their mothers, f*** their daughters and show your support for Palestine. Rape their daughters and we have to send a message like that. Please do it for the poor children in Gaza.' A police spokesman said officers received reports of people shouting anti-Semitic abuse from a car travelling within a convoy of vehicles through the St John's Wood area on the afternoon of Sunday, 16 May. 'Four men were arrested on suspicion of racially aggravated public order offences. They were taken into custody at a west London police station where they remain,' the spokesman said. While 'appalling' incidents of antisemitism have been reported, many peaceful pro-Palestinian protests have taken place across Britain - amid rising tensions in Israel. Officers engaged with protesters at a planned demonstration on Whitehall during the afternoon. 'The event passed peacefully and concluded without any arrests,' police said. It comes amid reports that a senior London rabbi was attacked by two youths near his Essex synagogue. Rabbi Rafi Goodwin's injuries are being assessed in King George's Hospital after he suffered cuts to his head and around one eye, following the attack in the Limes Estate area - which is not believed to be linked to world events, Jewish News reports. An email sent to members of the community this evening said: 'From the description of how the incident started, it does not, at this point appear to be an antisemitic attack.' An Essex Police spokesman told MailOnline officers attended Limes Avenue shortly after 1.15pm today following reports of a religiously-aggravated assault on a man in his 30s in Chigwell. A convoy of cars bearing the Palestinian flag drove through a Jewish community in north London today while the passengers screamed 'f*** their mothers, f*** their daughters Onlookers were left horrified after the convoy yelled: ''F*** all of them.

Please do it for the poor children in Gaza' Prime Minister Mr Johnson Tweeted: 'There is no place for anti-Semitism in our society. Ahead of Shavuot, I stand with Britain's Jews who should not have to endure the type of shameful racism we have seen today' While 'appalling' incidents of antisemitism have been reported, many peaceful pro-Palestinian protests have taken place across Britain - amid rising tensions in Israel. Pictured: Former Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn addresses the crowd in Bonn Square at the 'Speak up for Palestine' demonstration held in Oxford 'It is believed that two teenagers stepped out in front of the victim's vehicle whilst he was driving, they shouted at him and spoke in a derogatory way about his religion before going on to damage his car,' the spokesman added. Rabbi Rafi Goodwin's injuries are being assessed in King George's Hospital after he suffered cuts to his head and around one eye, following the attack in the Limes Estate area, Jewish News reports 'When he got out of his car to confront them, he was attacked with an unknown object causing him to require hospital treatment. During the attack the victim's phone was also stolen. The two boys – believed to be aged between 15 and 18 – are believed to have left the scene on foot. 'They have both been described as being of Asian ethnicity, one was 5ft 9ins tall and wore his hair in an Afro-style and the other was described as being 5ft 7ins tall. 'Both wore black jackets and the latter wore grey tracksuit bottoms. We know that this incident may be concerning for those in the local area, and we are working quickly to identify those responsible and to liaise with community leaders for any further support for those impacted.' It is not suggested that the assault was motivated by the current conflict in Israel The Finchley Road footage, along with other incidents that have emerged following large pro-Palestine rallies over the weekend, has received cross-party criticism. Prime Minister Mr Johnson Tweeted: 'There is no place for anti-Semitism in our society. Ahead of Shavuot, I stand with Britain's Jews who should not have to endure the type of shameful racism we have seen today.' TORY MP CRITICISED FOR 'PRIMITIVES' TWEET Tory MP Michael Fabricant has been criticised for describing pro-Palestine demonstrators clashing with police as 'primitives'. Anti-racism campaign Hope Not Hate called for the Conservative Party to suspend the backbencher on Sunday, accusing him of 'hateful racism that stirs up division'. Largely peaceful demonstrations took place across the UK over the weekend in solidarity with the people of Palestine, as Israel and Hamas exchange rocket fire in a deadly conflict. The MP for Lichfield shared a video of clashes with police outside the Israeli Embassy in London on Saturday. He tweeted: 'These primitives are trying to bring to London what they do in the Middle East.' Mr Fabricant deleted the message after it drew criticism on social media. Hope Not Hate said: 'The tense situation requires steady leadership from people who want to bring communities together, not hateful racism that stirs up division. The Conservatives must suspend Michael Fabricant for this disgraceful comment.' Director of the British Future think-tank Sunder Katwala tweeted: 'Anybody who realises that it is racist to hold British Jews responsible for Israeli policy should also be able recognise the racism here in Michael Fabricant's tweet.' Mr Fabricant sought to justify the comments, saying that 'attacks on the British police as shown in the video are disgraceful'. He told the PA news agency: 'It is primitive behaviour by people who preach anti-Semitism or racism of any kind, whether they be Jewish, Christian or Muslim. 'And the sort of anti-Semitism displayed by Hamas in the Middle East must not be repeated here in the UK.' Mr Fabricant's remarks came as video from a separate demonstration in the capital appeared to show anti-Semitic abuse being shouted from a car on Sunday in footage that drew criticism from across the political spectrum, including from Boris Johnson. 'There is no place for antisemitism in our society,' the Prime Minister tweeted. The Metropolitan Police said nine officers were injured as they attempted to disperse crowds outside the embassy on Saturday and 13 arrests were made. The Conservative Party is yet to respond to a request for comment. Advertisement Superintendent Jo Edwards, in charge of the policing operation, said: 'This behaviour was utterly shocking and will not be tolerated. I understand that this would have caused considerable concern within the community and we have arranged extra patrols in the St John's Wood and Golders Green areas this evening.' Mayor of London Sadiq Khan tweeted: 'Hate crimes are inexcusable and have no place in our city. I've been in touch with the Met Police Commissioner about the appalling reports of antisemitic attacks this weekend. 'Londoners can expect to see high visibility police patrols, and the Met Police have been working closely with the Community Security Trust. My team and I will continue to monitor the situation closely. The incident comes after thousands of people marched through London on Saturday to the gates of the Israeli embassy, while protests took place in other cities across the UK and Ireland in solidarity with the people of Palestine. Thousands of Palestinians have been forced to flee their homes after a week of sustained conflict. Since Monday night, Palestinian militant group Hamas has fired hundreds of rockets into Israel, whose military responded by barraging the Gaza Strip with tank fire and air strikes. Mike Freer, MP for Finchley and Golders Green, said: 'The scenes I've witnessed in my constituency today have left me sick to my stomach. 'The blatant and open anti-Semitism on display today, deliberately targeting areas with large Jewish populations is nothing short of incitement and I have urgently raised the matter with the Home Secretary, Commissioner and Mayor.' Home Secretary Priti Patel also described the scenes as 'disgusting anti-Semitism'. 'There is no place for this hatred in the UK,' she tweeted. 'I expect @metpoliceuk to be taking this seriously.' Labour MP Tulip Siddiq condemned the 'horrifying' scenes of anti-Semitism in Finchley, adding that there is 'no place' for 'vile hate speech'. Siddiq, the MP for Hampstead and Kilburn, tweeted: 'I have seen the footage of horrifying antisemitic behaviour on the Finchley Road in my constituency. 'It has been referred to the police and I hope action can and will be taken. This vile hate speech has no place in Hampstead and Kilburn or anywhere else.' Gideon Falter, Chief Executive of Campaign Against Antisemitism, told MailOnline: 'This convoy and demonstration were utterly predictable and preventable. They have been advertised for a week. 'Jews have had to witness the shocking reality that in 2021, people can drive through the capital of our country calling for our daughters to be raped, with nobody in sight to protect us or take action. 'There must be an immediate police crackdown on those responsible for these acts of Jew-hatred, and an inquiry into why the Metropolitan Police Service permitted these protests to go ahead without proper measures in place to stop this criminality, in full knowledge that today's scenes were likely to the point of certainty. 'Britain's Jews will not wait until this persistent antisemitic incitement leads to violence. We pray that it will not take bloodshed on our streets before the authorities realise they have let this go too far. These antisemitic thugs must face the full force of the law.' Pro-Palestinian demonstrators scuffle with police during a demonstration in London on Sunday A group of pro-Palestinian demonstrators crowd around a group of police officers who were forced to stand against their van The Metropolitan Police confirmed they have launched an urgent probe into the incident. 'We are aware of a video appearing to show anti-Semitic language being shouted from a convoy of cars in the St John's Wood area this afternoon,' the Met Police said. 'Officers are carrying out urgent enquiries to identify those responsible. This sort of behaviour will not be tolerated.' JEWISH COMMUNITY 'AFRAID ANTI-SEMITIC THREATS COULD TURN INTO ACTIONS' Members of the Jewish community are 'very afraid' that 'threats could turn into actions', a rabbi has said, in the wake of an anti-Semitic incident in London. A video, shared on social media, showed a convoy of cars covered with Palestinian flags passing down Finchley Road in north London, with passengers showing offensive language and threats against Jews. Four men have been arrested, the Metropolitan Police said on Sunday evening. Rabbi Herschel Gluck told the PA news agency: 'People are very concerned and very afraid about where this will lead. 'There is always the fear that threats could turn into actions.' He added: 'It is very important to emphasise in London that the Muslim and Jewish communities stand shoulder to shoulder and in a great spirit of solidarity. There aren't tensions locally, all these tensions are coming from people who have never seen a Jew and they are coming from outside London. 'I think it is important to stress that the Muslim and Jewish communities in London do not have any issues. 'The friendship and cooperation between our communities are as strong as ever.' The Metropolitan Police said the vehicle involved had been identified and the force was making enquiries to locate the occupants. In Chigwell on Sunday morning, an assistant rabbi was attacked a short distance from his synagogue, suffering blows to the head and face. Mr Gluck said: 'Whenever a person is attacked like this, it touches me deeply. The person themselves, their families, their congregation, and their friends are all affected by this. Even though it is an individual, it has much broader and wider ramifications.' He continued: 'At the moment, of course, we don't know what the motives are. But we are living in a time when, because of the situation in the Middle East, everyone is nervous, everyone is scared, everyone is concerned. 'People feel very insecure at the moment because of the heightened tensions in the world.' Advertisement Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer described the incident as 'utterly disgusting.' 'Anti-Semitism, misogyny and hate have no place on our streets or in our society,' he said. 'There must be consequences.' Referring to the video of the convoy, Housing and Communities Secretary Robert Jenrick said: 'This, on the streets of London, is deeply disturbing. Vile, criminal hatred like this must not be tolerated.' In a statement Mr Jenrick continued: 'Whatever your view of the conflict in Israel and Gaza, there is no justification for inciting anti-Jewish or anti-Muslim hatred. The incidents of anti-Semitism we have seen in recent days have been shameful. 'Some of the language used on marches this weekend and in posts on social media is intimidating, criminal and racist. 'We must not tolerate this vile, shameful hate in our country. These actions must stop.' Cabinet minister Michael Gove described another video appearing to show protesters shouting anti-Semitic abuse as 'deeply concerning'. Meanwhile spokesperson for Community Security Trust, a charity providing safety for the Jewish community in the UK, Dave Rich said: 'This video of vile antisemitism being shouted from a car as it passed through an area of London with a large Jewish community has caused enormous upset and alarm. 'It is outrageous and we are working closely with the police to assist in identifying the culprits. 'Tonight is the beginning of the Jewish festival of Shavuot and it is disgraceful that Jewish people should be subjected to this kind of intimidation as they prepare to celebrate.' Nigel Farage also condemned the convoy of cars, which were seen filling the roads across north London, as their horns blared and called on Home Secretary Priti Patel to act. 'This footage from Golders Green is shocking, provocative and dangerous,' Mr Farage tweeted. 'The Home Secretary and the police must act right now.' It comes after nine police officers were injured and missiles were thrown amid efforts to disperse pro-Palestine protesters outside the Israeli Embassy in London on Saturday. Further protesters have gathered in the capital today, with pro-Palestinian protesters scuffling with police. Communities Secretary Robert Jenrick condemned the violence he has seen in the last few days. 'Whatever your view of the conflict in Israel and Gaza, there is no justification for inciting anti-Jewish or anti-Muslim hatred.

The force said small pockets of disorder had followed a largely peaceful demonstration. Protesters were seen scaling buildings, climbing on the gates of Kensington palace, setting off fireworks and clambering to the top of traffic lights outside the embassy. A video showed that some clashed with police, with one officer shown on the ground injured while another man was arrested. A separate video showed people throwing drinks at officers stationed at the palace gates. Meanwhile, in Paris protesters defied a strict order against large gatherings to express their anger over the treatment of the Palestinian people. Riot police reacted with force, spraying desperate Parisians with water cannons to try to dispel the crowds. In Birmingham hundreds of demonstrators descended on the city centre today in support of Palestine amid escalating violence between the Arab state and Israel. Organisers in London say 'immediate action' is needed by the UK Government to help end the 'brutal' violence against the Palestinian people.

The names and ages of the children killed in the conflict were read out, followed by a minute's silence. People were told to move further down the road as a matter of crowd safety, and there were cheers as organisers told them the turnout was 'the biggest pro-Palestine demonstration since 2014'. Organisers said demonstrator numbers were estimated at 150,000. Coloured smoke was set off along Kensington High Street and some demonstrators climbed on to buildings and bus stops. Among the buildings to be scaled were the offices of the MailOnline, where protesters climbed on scaffolding and set off fireworks. It comes as thousands of Palestinians have been forced to flee from their homes after a week of sustained conflict.

'It's our global voices that will give succour, comfort and support in those settlements alongside Gaza and all over the West Bank, East Jerusalem who are suffering at this time. 'End the occupation now. End all the settlements now and withdraw then. End the siege of Gaza now.' Husam Zumlot, Palestinian ambassador to the UK, told crowds: 'This time is different. This time we will not be denied any more. We are united. We have had enough of oppression. Today we are saying enough, enough with the complicity. Thank you for standing with us.' The crowd stretched back to Bayswater Road from Kensington High Street. Former shadow home secretary Diane Abbott told crowds they were part of a 'worldwide movement for justice'. 'We must remember we are part of an international movement,' she said. 'This is a worldwide movement for justice. Palestinian people are having their land seized... and they are now being killed in their homes. All of this is illegal.'

Crowds chanted 'oh, Jeremy Corbyn' and threw roses as he took to the stage Crowds brought placards out with them. Signs read 'Freedom for Palestine' and 'Stop bombing Gaza' Organisers claimed around 150,000 descended on central London for the solidarity march on Saturday Protesters stood above the entrance to Marble Arch underground station near Hyde Park Demonstrators waved placards as they marched towards Kensington on Saturday afternoon Images from Birmingham show protesters waving Palestinian flags and holding Free Palestine banners as they called for an end to airstrikes. It is estimated up to one thousand people filed down crowded streets from Victoria Square to the Bull Ring. Saturday is the Palestinian Nakba day, which marks the anniversary of the expulsion of hundreds of thousands of Arabs from their homes more than 70 years ago. The Birmingham protests came after an Israeli rocket destroyed a media building in Gaza and an Israeli airstrike hit a Gaza refugee camp, killing ten people, including eight children. Hamas responded with a barrage of rockets on Israeli cities, killing one person in Tel Aviv. The fighting began May 10 when Hamas fired long-range rockets toward Jerusalem after days of clashes between Palestinian protesters and Israeli police at the Al-Aqsa Mosque compound, a flashpoint site sacred to Jews and Muslims. On Saturday, demonstrators in London marched from Marble Arch Station to the Israeli embassy, holding banners and chanting. The Metropolitan Police said: 'Officers are engaging with a group of people who have gathered for a demonstration in central London this afternoon. 'A policing plan is in place to ensure everybody is kept safe and to reduce the spread of Covid-19.' It comes amid reports an Israeli air strike destroyed a high-rise building that housed the AP, Al-Jazeera and other media in the Gaza Strip. The AP said the air strike came roughly an hour after the Israeli military ordered people to evacuate the building. Demonstrators walk through Hyde Park as they make their way to the Israeli embassy in London, during a march in solidarity with the people of Palestine amid the ongoing conflict with Israel Protesters at a rally to express solidarity with Palestine at Marble Arch on May 15 in London after several Israeli cities experienced clashes between Jewish and Arab mobs in recent days Among those expected to address the crowds are former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, Diane Abbott and Zarah Sultana. It comes as thousands of Palestinians have been forced to flee from their homes after a week of sustained conflict The news agency said there was no immediate explanation as to why the building was targeted. The demonstration in London was organised by Palestine Solidarity Campaign, Friends of Al-Aqsa, Palestinian Forum in Britain, Stop The War Coalition, Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament and the Muslim Association of Britain. A spokesperson for the organisers said: 'It is vital that the UK Government takes immediate action. It must stop allowing Israel's brutal violence against and oppression of the Palestinian people to go unpunished. 'The bombardment of Gaza which is killing civilians including children is a war crime. The UK Government is complicit in these acts as long as it continues to offer Israel military, diplomatic and financial support.' It comes after a week of rising tensions, when Israel on Thursday pressed ahead with a fierce military offensive in the Gaza Strip, killing as many as 11 senior Hamas military figures and toppling a pair of high-rise towers housing Hamas facilities in a series of airstrikes. The Islamic militant group showed no signs of backing down and fired hundreds of rockets at Israeli cities, including heavily populated Tel Aviv and Jerusalem. Palestinian militants have stockpiled enough missiles to continue bombing Israel for the next two months, security experts have warned, as escalating fighting led the UN to warn of 'all-out war'. PARIS: Marches in support of Palestinians in the Gaza Strip were also held today in a dozen French cities, but the focus was on Paris, where riot police got ready as organizers said they would defy a ban on the protest.

The conflict sparked hundreds of demonstrators across the US Wednesday. In Downtown Chicago, a rally organized by the Chicago Coalition for Justice in Palestine, drew a crowd of nearly 1,000 protestors who said Palestinians were being mistreated. One woman held sign that said: 'Free Palestine!' In New York, protesters clashed in Times Square, with both sides screaming at each other and separated by barricades. Pro-Israel supporters could be seen draped in flags. In Cleveland, an Israel supporter asked people not to forget the people suffering in that country, even though he said Palestinians are made out to be the victims. And in Los Angeles, pro-Israel demonstrators gathered in front of the city's federal building; the prior day in the city there had been skirmishes between the factions, but photos from the scene showed only Israel supporters waving American and Israel flags. A protester wears a mask with the Palestinian flag painted on it as demonstrators marched through Hyde Park Flares were set off as the march continued through Hyde Park en route to the Israeli embassy Protesters held white roses and draped themselves in the Palestinian flag as they marched on Saturday Hundreds of people joined the protest as demonstrators marched in solidarity with the Palestinian people Demonstrators started gathering outside Marble Arch Station at midday for the march on Saturday Marches in support of Palestinians in the Gaza Strip were also held today in a dozen French cities, but the focus was on Paris, where riot police got ready as organizers said they would defy a ban on the protest. Paris police chief Didier Lallement ordered shops closed around the starting point of the planned march in a working-class neighbourhood in northern Paris after an administrative court confirmed the ban. Authorities noted a banned July 2014 pro-Palestinian protest against an Israeli offensive in Gaza that degenerated into violence and running battles with police to justify the order against Saturday's march. Pictured: Israeli boy, five, killed by Hamas rocket shrapnel A five-year-old boy killed in Israel by rocket fire from Gaza has been pictured, after he became one of the country's seven victims of the latest cross-border conflict. Ido Avigal was fatally stuck by shrapnel after the building he was in with his mother was hit by a missile on Wednesday night. In the building, found in the town of Sderot on the border with Gaza, seven people were hurt when it suffered a direct hit from a rocket. Ido Avigal, who was killed in his home in Sderot by a rocket fired from Gaza on May 12, 2021. Avigal was pronounced dead several hours later, becoming the seventh Israeli victim of the cross border conflict that started earlier this week The boy's mother grabbed him and took him into a fortified room when the in-coming rocket sirens sounded, according to local Hebrew media reports cited by the Times of Israel. However, in a rare tragedy, shrapnel from the rocket punctured the shelter's window, critically wounding the boy and also injuring his mother. Avigal was pronounced dead several hours later, becoming the seventh Israeli victim of the cross border conflict that started earlier this week. Advertisement Organizers said they intend to 'denounce the latest Israeli aggressions' and mark the fleeing of Palestinians after Israel declared independence in 1948. In Israel heightened tensions led to street brawls in areas populated by Jews and Arabs, with an Arab man dragged from his car and beaten by Jewish ultranationalists in one attack, while in another a Jewish citizen was attacked by sticks and stones by Arab Israeli protesters. At least 122 people have been killed in Gaza since violence escalated on Monday, according to the enclave's health ministry. Eight people have been killed in Israel, medical officials said. One of the Israelis - a five-year-old boy named Ido Avigal - was killed by shrapnel on Wednesday night in the Gaza border town of Sderot when rockets struck the building he was living in with his mother. Britain's Boris Johnson led international leaders in calling for the two sides to step back from the brink, but a UN Security Council meeting failed to agree on a joint statement due to opposition from the United States, Israel's key ally, diplomats said. Pleas for calm appeared in vain as Israeli and Palestinian leaders traded blood-curdling threats and further rocket strikes, with a rocket setting off alarms in the north of Israel in the early hours of Thursday morning - some 62 miles North of Gaza - sending thousands of Israelis to shelters. And after a senior Hamas commander was killed Wednesday, the Islamist militant group responded with a barrage of rockets into southern Israel which rescue workers said killed a six-year-old boy. Israel's defence minister Benny Gantz vowed more attacks on Gaza to bring 'total, long-term quiet' before they would consider truce talks after six days of violence. Prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu said his military would only use 'increasing force' in the conflict. 'We eliminated senior Hamas commanders and this is just the beginning,' he said. 'We will inflict blows on them that they couldn't even dream of.' The leader of Hamas Ismail Haniyeh hit back, vowing that 'if Israel wants to escalate, we are ready for it'. Six high-ranking commanders and a further five key Hamas figures were 'neutralised' on Wednesday, including Brigadier General Bassem Issa and Jamal Zabda, head of the group's rocket unit, according to the Israeli Defence Force (IDF). On Tuesday, Mr Johnson tweeted a plea for both sides to 'step back from the brink' and 'show restraint'. He added: 'The UK is deeply concerned by the growing violence and civilian casualties and we want to see an urgent de-escalation of tensions.' His calls were backed up by similar messages from the EU, the US, Russia and Turkey. The UN's Middle East peace envoy Tor Wennesland warned the latest violence was 'escalating towards a full-scale war'. And UN secretary-general Antonio Guterres said he was 'gravely concerned' by the ongoing troubles. Hamas and Islamic Jihad fired more than 1,000 missiles in the first 48 hours of the conflict which began on Monday, an average of one every three minutes, and has enough to keep the bombardment going for two months. Israeli military spokesman Lt Col Jonathan Conricus said: 'According to our estimates we're talking about between 20,000 and 30,000 rockets in Gaza today, rockets and mortars. 'We've seen a constant expansion in terms of range and also in terms of the size of the warheads. They have an advanced arsenal of rockets, I think it's on a par with the fire capabilities of a few small European countries.' Six high-ranking commanders and a further five key Hamas figures were 'neutralised' on Wednesday, including Brigadier General Bassem Issa and Jamal Zabda, head of the group's rocket unit, according to the Israeli Defence Force (IDF) While Israel's Iron Dome aerial defence system has intercepted nine out of ten Palestinian rockets, the remainder have killed at least six civilians and injured more than 90. Families in Tel Aviv have taken cover in underground shelters. Israel's retaliation has included hundreds of air strikes on Gaza, led by F-35 stealth bombers and Apache attack helicopters, which are understood to have killed 32 and wounded more than 300. Israel says most of the dead were terrorists and insists the children killed were victims of stray Palestinian rockets. The UN security council met Tuesday to discuss the crisis. The heaviest offensive between Israel and Hamas since a 2014 war in the Hamas-ruled enclave has increased international concern that the situation could spiral out of control. 'Israel has gone crazy,' said a man on a Gaza street, where people ran out of their homes as explosions rocked buildings. Israel's army last week said it had received a rocket warning in the north of the country, the first time the alert has been given there since hostilities soared between Israel and Palestinians earlier this week. The approximately 1,500 rockets fired from Gaza by Hamas militants since Monday had so far set off warnings in southern and central Israel, but not in the north, the army said. However in the small hours of the morning of May 6, alarms not only sounded in the economic capital Tel Aviv in the middle of the country - where residents rushed to shelters - but also in Jezreel Valley in the north. There was no immediate word of a rocket strike or casualties in Nahalal, some 100 km (62 miles) from Gaza.""]"

Nearly 40,000 people descended on the capital Brussels to protest against new anti-Covid measures banning the unvaccinated from entering restaurants and bars. Some protesters were seen throwing projectiles at riot police and in response, officers fired water cannon and tear gas at the group. Police have made some arrests, but it is not immediately clear how many. Video footage from Brussels shows a large group of protesters shouting at police as some light flares and throw them at the officers. One man can even be seen mooning at them. The protests descended into chaos, with some of the protesters seen setting fires on the streets while others threw rocks through the windows of local businesses including a post office. Two police cars have also been damaged. The protest came just hours after it emerged Germany is set to follow Austria's example in making vaccinations compulsory with ministers admitting that the move is 'unavoidable' amid a fourth wave of the pandemic which is crippling the country's hospitals. Last night also saw similar demonstrations against virus restrictions take place in Austria, Switzerland, Croatia, Italy, Northern Ireland, Austria and North Macedonia on Saturday, a day after Dutch police opened fire on protesters and seven people were injured in rioting that erupted in Rotterdam. Europe has become the epicentre of the pandemic once again, with the World Health Organisation warning that the Continent was the only region in the world where deaths had increased as Covid-related fatalities spiked by five per cent just this week. In France, the government has warned that the fifth wave of coronavirus are rising at 'lightning speed', with new daily Covid cases close to doubling over the past week. In Belgium, cases have been surging, with infections reaching 13,836 on Sunday. In response, the government has introduced restrictions including a ban on the unvaccinated from venues such as restaurants and bars, and an order to work from home at least four days a week. Police said 35,000 protesters marched from the North Station in Brussels on Sunday afternoon against a fresh round of Covid measures announced by the government on Wednesday. The demonstration, called 'Together for Freedom', saw some protesters clash with riot police near the Belgian capital's EU and government district. Many of the protesters caught up in the clash were wearing hoods and carried Flemish nationalist flags. A total of 42 people were detained and two were arrested in the riots. Meanwhile, three police officers were injured and taken to hospital and one protester was hurt after a firework exploded in his hand.

Several police officers were injured after protesters threw bottles and fireworks at them. Last week, Belgium's Prime Minister Last week, Belgium's Prime Minister Alexander De Croo said 'the alarm signals are all red' as he imposed tough restrictions, ordering people to work at home for at least four days a week. Under new restrictions, all people in indoor venues such as cafes and restaurants will need to wear a mask unless seated and the rule will apply to those aged 10 or older. The previous age threshold was 12. Nightclubs may have to test their guests if they want to let them dance mask-free. People wanting to eat in a restaurant or go to the theatre already must present a COVID pass, showing vaccination, a negative test or recent recovery. Most Belgians will also have to work from home four days a week until mid-December, and for three days after that. Belgium has one of the highest cases per capita rates in the European Union, behind only the Baltic and former Yugoslav nations and Austria, at around one per hundred people over the past 14 days, according to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control. 'The alarm signals are all red,' prime minister Alexander De Croo told a news conference. 'We had all hoped to have a winter without coronavirus, but Belgium is not an island.' Niels Van Regenmortel, the intensive care units coordinator at the ZNA Stuivenberg hospital in Antwerp, said there was an increasing risk hospitals in Belgium will have to resort to triage as ICUs fill up amid soaring COVID-19 numbers, calling on the government to restrict night life. In Germany, the number of Covid cases are soaring daily, with the country reporting 48,201 infections on Saturday - the highest number of new coronavirus cases since the beginning of the pandemic. The fourth wave is overwhelming hospitals, with health chiefs warning that the situation is 'extremely critical' across the country. In France, fifth-wave coronavirus infections are rising at an alarming rate, the government reported Sunday, with new daily Covid cases close to doubling over the past week. In Germany, a relatively low vaccination rate - hovering under 70 per cent - has left the country vulnerable to the virus. Germany's federal tourism commissioner Thomas Bareiß has now said the worsening situation makes it clear that compulsory vaccination is 'unavoidable'. Bareiß told DPA news agency: 'In retrospect, it was wrong not to see that right from the start. The hope at that time is understandable, but it was not realistic.' His calls were echoed by the Prime Minister of Bavaria, which has seen Covid cases surge, who said 'in the end we will not be able to avoid compulsory vaccination'. The above graph shows the Covid infection rate per million people for western European countries from November last year.

Pictured: Protesters in Brussels on Sunday Riot police raise their shields as they clash with protesters on a bridge in Brussels on Sunday during anti-vaccine demonstrations Thousands of protesters, many of them peaceful, marched through the streets of Brussels on Sunday. Some held signs which read 'Stand up for your rights' and 'Stop the madness' Mr Bareiß, the tourism commissioner of Germany's federal government, said a compulsory vaccination is 'unavoidable'. Putin tells Russia he had Covid booster jab Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Sunday he had taken a third dose of a Covid vaccine, as the country struggled with a fresh wave of the virus. 'I had it two hours ago,' Putin said on state television channel Rossiya 24, assuring viewers that his booster injection of the Sputnik vaccine had been painless. The authorities are struggling to convince people to get vaccinated against Covid, even as a fresh wave of the virus is killing record numbers every day. Even though Russia has several vaccines that it has manufactured itself, only 36.7 percent of the population is fully vaccinated, according to the Gogov website, which tracks the data. Putin, who said he opposes universal mandatory vaccination, has backed measures taken in some regions for certain people. For example, in June, authorities in Moscow said vaccination would be obligatory for anyone working in the service sector. Russia recorded more than 9.3 million cases of Covid and just over 264,000 deaths, which makes it the worst-hit country in Europe. The actual toll from the pandemic there was closer to 450,000 at the end of September, according to figures from the Rosstat statistics agency however, which works with a broader definition of Covid-linked deaths. Advertisement He said: 'For me it is politically no longer justifiable that entire industries, retailers, restaurants, clubs, bars and the entire cinema, cultural and event scene live in a state of crisis prescribed by the state for 20 months and are faced with great existential fears, while others are concerned take the freedom not to vaccinate. 'So far, historical measures and sums of money have been able to save many companies. That doesn't work in the long run.' In Bavaria, there has been a 'dramatic' coronavirus resurgence. It prompted the Bavarian state capital of Munich to become the first major German city to cancel its Christmas market, which usually draws some three million visitors. The Bavarian Prime Minister Markus Söder said he believes the country will 'not be able to avoid' compulsory vaccination. He told Berliner Zeitung: 'I believe that in the end we will not be able to avoid compulsory vaccination. Otherwise it will be an endless loop with this coronavirus.' The director of Frankfurt University Hospital said the situation in intensive care units in the state of Hesse is 'critical'. Jürgen Graf, who is also the head of the planning staff for the inpatient care of Covid patients in Hesse at the Ministry of Health, told Bild: 'The situation is extremely critical. What we are currently doing is crisis management.' He added: 'This is not a problem for Covid patients, it affects everyone,' explaining that inpatient care and the care of emergency patients are 'impaired' due to longer wait times. The warning comes as a hospital in Bavaria's Freising last week made the unprecedented decision to transfer a Covid-19 patient to northern Italy because it 'had no more capacity to receive them, and the surrounding hospitals were also full.' Almost one per cent of the new infections end up in the intensive care unit, Graf said. 'Given the current number of infections, that would be 50 or more patients per week in addition to the approximately 250 patients treated there today,' he added. 'Then in a few weeks we will be well above last winter's high.' The fourth wave is overwhelming hospitals, with health chiefs warning that the situation is 'extremely critical' across the country. Pictured: Doctors and nurses tend to a patient on the Covid-19 intensive care unit at University Hospital Leipzig on November 18 THE NETHERLANDS: A day after Rotterdam rioting that saw seven people injured, thousands more took to Amsterdam's central Dam Square and The Hague (pictured above), with seven arrests being made according to police AUSTRIA: Protesters carrying a banner reading 'Control the border. Not your people' at the anti-lockdown demonstration held by the far-right Freedom Party in Vienna today The fourth wave of infections has plunged Germany, Europe's largest economy, into a national emergency, Health Minister Jens Spahn said. He urged people to reduce their social contacts, warning that vaccinations alone would not reduce case numbers. Asked if Germany could rule out an Austrian-style full lockdown, Spahn said: 'We are now in a situation - even if this produces a news alert - where we can't rule anything out. 'We are in a national emergency,' he told a news conference. Their comments come after the upper house of parliament on Friday approved new measures to control the outbreak proposed by the centre-left alliance that emerged after the September 26 national election. Three people treated in hospital and inquiry launched after Dutch police fired warning shots during Rotterdam riots Three people were being treated in hospital in Rotterdam on Saturday after they were seriously injured when Dutch police fired shots during a violent protest against COVID-19 measures, authorities said. Crowds of several hundred rioters torched cars, set off fireworks and threw rocks at police during the protests on Friday evening. Police responded with warning shots and water canons. Rotterdam police posted on Twitter on Saturday that 51 people had been arrested, half of whom were under 18. 'Three rioters were wounded when they were hit by bullets, they remain in hospital,' police added, in an update after earlier reporting two wounded. Authorities are investigating the shootings including whether the wounded people where hit by police bullets, they added. The city's mayor, Ahmed Aboutaleb, said the protest had turned into 'an orgy of violence.' 'Police were forced to draw their weapons and even fire direct shots,' he told a news conference early on Saturday. Dutch Justice Minister Ferd Grapperhaus said in a statement the 'extreme violence' against police and firefighters in Rotterdam was 'repulsive.' 'The right to protest is very important in our society but what we saw last night was simply criminal behaviour,' Grapperhaus said. Protesters had gathered to voice opposition to government plans to restrict access to indoor venues to people who have a 'corona pass,' showing they have been vaccinated or have already recovered from an infection. The pass is also available to people who have not been vaccinated, but have proof of a negative test. Advertisement The measures include requirements for people to prove they are vaccinated, recently recovered from Covid-19 or have tested negative for the virus in order to access communal workplaces or public transport. Separately, outgoing Chancellor Angela Merkel agreed with the governors of Germany's 16 states to introduce a new threshold linked to the number of hospital admissions of Covid-19 patients per 100,000 people over a seven-day period. The new three-tier system would require people to show evidence of a vaccination or previous infection to enter public buildings or businesses in states where hospitalisation rates go above 3 in 100,000 people, based on a seven-day average. At present, that will affect 9 of Germany's 16 states. In France, the seven-day average of new cases reached 17,153 on Saturday, up from 9,458 a week earlier, according to the health authorities, an increase of 81 percent. 'The fifth wave is starting at lightning speed,' government spokesman Gabrial Attal said. The latest seven-day increase is three times the average rise of cases recorded over the previous three weeks, indicating an exponential acceleration of infections. For now the spike in infections has not led to a massive influx of Covid patients into hospitals, with the authorities attributing the limited number of intensive care patients to France's high rate of vaccinations which appear highly effective against the most dangerous forms of Covid. On Saturday, hospitals reported a total of 7,974 Covid patients in their care, with 1,333 of them in intensive treatment. This compares to 6,500 and 1,000, respectively, a month earlier. 'There is a very strong increase in infections, but we also know that in France we have a very large vaccination cover,' he said. 'We seem to be ahead of our neighbours concerning booster shots.' France's introduction of a health pass ahead of other countries in the summer was also helping to keep Covid in check, he said. The health pass, required in French restaurants, cafes and many cultural venues, certifies that a person is fully vaccinated, has recently recovered from Covid, or has tested negative for the virus. The government continues to stand by its choice to 'bring the weight of restrictions to bear on non-vaccinated people rather than vaccinated people', Attal said Last night, Europe descended into a second night of violent carnage amid the return of strict lockdown rules aimed at curbing rising rates of Covid infection. Thousands of people took to Amsterdam's central Dam Square and the Hague on Saturday, a day after the 'orgy of violence' during the Rotterdam riots that saw seven people injured. Police said seven arrests were made on Sunday after youths set streets ablaze and shot fireworks at officers. Video footage from the Hague showed motorists sounding their horns in support as a trio of small explosions could be clearly seen on the main road in the background. Elsewhere, protesters were pictured ripping down street signs in chaotic scenes. Anti-riot police were forced to clear the wreckage of smouldering scooters and burnt-out bicycles that were torched by the anti-vax mob and left to block roads in one of the worst outbreaks of violence in the country since Covid restrictions were first implemented. Meanwhile, similar demonstrations against virus restrictions also took place in Switzerland, Croatia, Italy, Northern Ireland, Austria and North Macedonia on Saturday, a day after Dutch police opened fire on protesters and seven people were injured in rioting that erupted in Rotterdam. It comes as violence broke out in Vienna on Saturday as 10,000 protesters - many from far-right groups - took to the streets to demonstrate against new Covid-19 restrictions and mandatory vaccinations. Police were pictured arresting two protesters. A spokesman said there had been fewer than 10 arrests, for breaches of coronavirus restrictions and the ban on Nazi symbols. Some protesters mockingly wore doctor's scrubs, while others wore the yellow stars as badges in reference to Nazi Germany's policy of forcing Jews to wear the badge as identification. Chanting 'resistance!', waving Austrian flags and blowing whistles, the crowd swelled to more than 30,000. Many held signs mocking government leaders including Chancellor Alexander Schallenberg and Health Minister Wolfgang Mueckstein. Protesters rallied against coronavirus restrictions and mandatory COVID-19 passes needed in many European countries to enter restaurants, Christmas markets or sports events, as well as mandatory vaccinations. The Austrian protest, which was promoted by the far-right opposition Freedom Party, became violent and five police officers were injured - a development which Austria's Interior Minister Karl Nehammer slammed as 'unacceptable'. Nehammer told a press conference on Sunday morning: 'If at a meeting that is organised and promoted by a parliamentary party, where police officers are attacked and Nazi crimes are played down by wearing the Jewish star, that is unacceptable.' The protesters had worn the yellow Jewish star as badges, with the words 'unvaccinated' stitched on, as they compared the lockdown and mandatory vaccination measures with the atrocities of the Nazi era. Nehammer said: 'This is not only completely tasteless, it plays down the crimes of the National Socialists and offends the millions of victims of the Nazi dictatorship and their families.' The interior minister said some of the protesters were from right-wing extremist groups, with some setting fire to a police car and confessing that they 'wanted to burn a police officer'. 'This is an extent of radicalisation that is by no means acceptable,' Nehammer said, adding that the police officers 'professionally ensured security in a difficult mission'. AUSTRIA: Thousands of residents - one holding a sign reading 'no to mandatory vaccination' - today gathered in Vienna to demonstrate against new Covid restrictions amid soaring infection rates across the continent In Italy, 3,000 turned out in the capital's Circus Maximus, a field where in ancient times Romans staged popular entertainment, to protest against 'Green Pass' certificates required at workplaces, restaurants, cinemas, theaters, sports venues and gyms, as well as for long-distance train, bus or ferry travel within Italy. In Northern Ireland, several hundred people opposed to vaccine passports protested outside the city hall in Belfast, where the city's Christmas market opened Saturday - a market where proof of vaccination or a negative COVID-19 test was required. The Northern Ireland government voted this week to introduce vaccine certificates for admission to nightclubs, bars and restaurants starting Dec. 13. 'People like us never give up,' read one banner, in the red, white and green colors of the Italian flag. Virtually no one at the Rome protest wore a protective mask. Switzerland saw 2,000 people protest an upcoming referendum on whether to approve the government's COVID-19 restrictions law, claiming it was discriminatory, public broadcaster SRF reported. In Croatia, thousands gathered at in the capital Zagreb, carrying Croatian flags, nationalist and religious symbols, along with banners against vaccination and what they describe as restrictions of people's freedoms. And in Denmark, more than one thousand gathered outside the Danish parliament in Copenhagen to push back against the reintroduction of the national health pass. North Macedonia also saw hundreds of anti-vaccination protesters march in downtown Skopje on Satruday evening against the country's health authority's recommendation of mandatory vaccinations. Demonstrations against virus measures are also expected in other European countries - the latest in rising anger at the re-introduction of restrictions amid soaring cases on the continent. This comes as the World Health Organization (WHO) said it was 'very worried' about the spread of Covid-19 within Europe as the continent battles a fresh wave of infections. Regional director Dr Hans Kluge told the BBC that some 500,000 more deaths could be recorded by March unless urgent action is taken.

The island's prefect on Friday introduced the night-time stay-at-home order after protests against the coronavirus vaccine pass spiralled into violence the previous night. But the measure did little to quell the rioting. 'The night was very turbulent,' a police source said. The security forces recorded 'some 20 incidents of looting or attempted robbery' in the seaside towns of Pointe-a-Pitre and Le Gosier, including at a jewellery shop, a bank, a betting shop and a shopping centre. In the town of Saint-Francois to the east, 'gendarmes coming out of the station were threatened by blazing projectiles'. A second source within the gendarmerie said an armoury had been looted. The first source said 'firearms were used against police forces in four different areas' across the island, and one member was slightly wounded after a stone hit him in the face. In the area of Le Petit-Bourg to the west, firemen had to put out fires in two mobile phone stores, which had also been plundered. The interior ministry said 31 people had been arrested. France late Saturday said it was sending around 50 personnel from both its RAID elite police force and its GIGN counter-terrorism unit to Guadeloupe. The doctors' union in Guadeloupe warned against further trouble while the health system was so 'fragile'. They criticised 'individuals who may have prevented patients from getting access to treatment, or medical staff from reaching their place of practice'. While most people in mainland France have now received two vaccination doses, rates in its overseas territories have lagged behind. By November 16, some 46 percent of adults in Guadeloupe had received at least one jab of a vaccine against Covid. Advertisement Five police officers were injured during rioting at the Hague, with one taken to hospital suffering concussion and two suffering hearing damage from loud fireworks,. A rock thrown by rioters also smashed the window of a passing ambulance carrying a patient, the city's police force said. Elsewhere in the Netherlands, two football matches in the Eredivise, the top professional league, were briefly halted after fans - banned from matches under a partial lockdown in force in the Netherlands for a week - broke into stadiums in the towns of Alkmaar and Almelo. Earlier Saturday, two protests against COVID-19 measures went off peacefully in Amsterdam and the southern city of Breda. Police said in a tweet that seven people were arrested in The Hague and five officers were injured. One needed treatment in a hospital. Local media reported that rioters threw bicycles, wooden pallets and motorized scooters on one of the fires. The chaos in The Hague was on a smaller scale than the pitched battles on the streets of Rotterdam on Friday night, when police said that three rioters were hit by bullets and investigations were underway to establish if they were shot by police. Officers in Rotterdam arrested 51 people, about half of them minors, police said Saturday afternoon. One police officer was hospitalized with a leg injury sustained in the rioting, another was treated by ambulance staff and 'countless' others suffered minor injuries. Mayor Ahmed Aboutaleb told reporters in the early hours of Saturday morning that 'on a number of occasions the police felt it necessary to draw their weapons to defend themselves' as rioters rampaged through the port city's central shopping district, setting fires and throwing rocks and fireworks at officers. 'They shot at protesters, people were injured,' Aboutaleb said. He did not have details on the injuries. Police also fired warning shots. Justice Minister Ferd Grapperhaus condemned the events. 'The riots and extreme violence against police officers, riot police and firefighters last night in Rotterdam are disgusting to see,' he said in a statement. 'Protesting is a great right in our society, but what we saw last night is simply criminal behavior. It has nothing to do with demonstrating,' he added. An independent investigation into the shootings by police was opened, as is the case whenever Dutch police use their weapons. As the march kicked off on Vienna's Heldenplatz, thousands of protesters gathered on the massive square. About 1,300 police officers were on duty. They used loudspeakers to tell protesters masks were required, but most did not wear them. Chanting 'resistance!' and blowing whistles, protesters began to move slowly down the city's inner ring road. Many waved Austrian flags and carried signs mocking government leaders like Chancellor Alexander Schallenberg and Health Minister Wolfgang Mueckstein. Some wore doctor's scrubs; others donned tinfoil hats. Most of the signs focused on the newly announced vaccine mandate: 'My Body, My Choice,' read one. 'We're Standing Up for Our Kids!' said another. By mid-afternoon the crowds had swelled to roughly 35,000 people, according to the police, and were marching down Vienna's inner ring road before heading back towards the Hofburg. Police were pictured arresting two protesters. A spokesman said there had been fewer than 10 arrests, for breaches of coronavirus restrictions and the ban on Nazi symbols. Meanwhile, a few hundred protesters gathered in Amsterdam today and a similar number marched through the southern city of Breda over the latest Covid-19 measures. Riots also erupted in the central 'Bible Belt' town of Urk and cities in southern Limburg province, while angry fans disrupted two football matches being played behind closed doors because of coronavirus rules, Dutch media said. It comes after violent riots last night in which 51 were arrested in Rotterdam after thousands of anti-lockdown protesters gathered on one of the city's main shopping streets. Dutch police fired water canons, 'warning shots' and bullets at protesters to disperse the crowd who had lit fires and set off fireworks. Police confirmed seven injuries, including officers, in the violence but did not say if live ammunition or rubber bullets were fired. The Netherlands re-imposed some lockdown measures last weekend for an initial three weeks in an effort to slow a resurgence of coronavirus contagion, but daily infections have remained at their highest levels since the start of the pandemic. The Dutch government has said it wants to introduce a law that would allow businesses to restrict the country's coronavirus pass system to only people who are fully vaccinated or have recovered from Covid-19 - that would exclude people who test negative. The violent scenes in Rotterdam mirrored much of the continent's reaction to similar schemes announced by Austria, Germany, the Czech Republic, and Slovakia - with Italy and Greece also reportedly considering moves to restrict the movements of unvaccinated people.

The lockdown, which comes into effect on Monday, constitutes the toughest restrictions introduced in Europe in recent weeks as Covid-19 cases surge continent-wide, fuelled by vaccine resistance. Austrians will not be allowed to leave home except to go to work, shop for essentials and exercise. The restrictions will initially last 20 days with an evaluation after 10 days, Chancellor Alexander Schallenberg said. Vaccination against Covid-19 in the Alpine nation will be mandatory from February 1 next year, Schallenberg said. So far, the Vatican alone in Europe has imposed a vaccination mandate. The World Health Organization continues to favour policies that 'demonstrate the benefit and safety of vaccines for the greatest possible acceptance of vaccines, rather than imposed mandatory vaccination,' spokeswoman Fadela Chaib told reporters in Geneva. Austria has already imposed movement restrictions on those not vaccinated or recently recovered from the virus, ordering them to stay at home since Monday, becoming the first EU country to do so. But infections have continued to rise. On Friday, a new record of more than 15,800 new cases was recorded in the EU member of nearly nine million people. Reporting by AFP Advertisement Austrians are protesting against a new national lockdown and mandatory vaccinations, which the government said yesterday would be rolled out on February 1. Vaccinations in Austria have plateaued at one of the lowest rates in Western Europe - under 66 per cent - and hospitals in heavily hit states have warned that their intensive care units are reaching capacity. Austrian Chancellor Alexander Schallenberg said yesterday the country would go in lockdown for 10 days. The shutdown will then reevaluated and could be extended for a further 10 days. Most stores will close, and cultural events will be canceled. People will be able to leave their homes only for certain specific reasons, including buying groceries, going to the doctor or exercising. Average daily deaths have tripled in recent weeks and its infections are among the highest in Europe, with a seven-day incidence of 991 per 100,000 people. 'We have not succeeded in convincing enough people to get vaccinated,' Chancellor Alexander Schallenberg told a news conference. 'It hurts that such measures still have to be taken.' Schallenberg also apologised to all vaccinated people on Friday night saying it was not fair they had to suffer under the renewed lockdown restrictions when they had done everything to help contain the virus. 'I'm sorry to take this drastic step,' he said on public broadcaster ORF. Despite the violence a day earlier, around 300 protesters marched through the southern Dutch town of Breda near the Belgian border on Saturday carrying banners with slogans such as 'No Lockdown'. Organisers said they opposed Prime Minister Mark Rutte's plans to exclude the unvaccinated from bars and restaurants. A group that had called an Amsterdam protest for Saturday, United We Stand Europe, said on Facebook it had cancelled the rally because 'last night, all hell broke loose in Rotterdam'. But several hundred flag-waving protesters still gathered in central Dam Square, watched over by police vans, according to Dutch media and images on social media.

Local news outlet NL Times reported that a journalist was attacked of the street, while local broadcaster Rijnmond said the reporter was beaten and his camera was destroyed. Local media also reported gangs of soccer hooligans were involved in the rioting. One eyewitness - a press photographer – told local media they saw shell casings 'everywhere on the floor'. Cops also said it was 'unclear how or by whom' two people were shot during the chaos. Video from social media on Dutch broadcaster NOS appeared to show the person being hit in Rotterdam, but there was no explanation on what happened. Officers arrested 51 protesters last night and were expected to detain several more after studying video footage from security cameras. Late on Friday night, police said downtown Rotterdam remained restive and there was still a heavy police presence on the streets. Mayor Ahmed Aboutaleb told reporters in the early hours of Saturday morning that 'on a number of occasions the police felt it necessary to draw their weapons to defend themselves' as rioters ran rampage through the port city's central shopping district, setting fires and throwing rocks and fireworks at officers. 'They shot at protesters, people were injured,' Aboutaleb said, adding that several officers were injured in the violence. Police spokesperson Patricia Wessels confirmed that police fired shots, though it was not immediately clear what type of rounds were fired. 'We fired warning shots and there were also direct shots fired because the situation was life-threatening,' she said. 'We know that at least two people were wounded, probably as a result of the warning shots, but we need to investigate the exact causes further.' Police said that riot police later launched charges at the demonstrators, adding: 'The water launcher has been deployed.' The situation had largely calmed late on Friday but the smoking wreckage of a burned-out police car and dozens of smashed bicycles littered the scene, an AFP reporter said. Police tweeted that rioters started fires and threw fireworks during the rioting and authorities closed the city's main railway station and officers lined up on the streets of Rotterdam Pictured: A scooter is seen set ablaze in Rotterdam on Friday night as people too to the streets against Covid restrictions A scooter in Rotterdam city centre that was burnt out during anti-lockdown riots on Friday night after thousands of people took to the streets over the government's 2G policy that restricts unvaccinated people from certain venues Hundreds of people gather during a protest against the 2G (Covid-pass) policy in Coolsingel, Rotterdam, Netherlands, 19 November 2021 Demonstrators take part in a protest against a partial coronavirus lockdown and against the government policy on Coolsingel street on November 19, 2021 in the port city of Rotterdam Left: A grab from footage that appeared to show a person being shot in Rotterdam on Friday night (circled).

Professor John Edmund said today that opposition to stringent restrictions on the continent have demonstrated the importance of booster jabs, warning, 'it is pretty clear immunity does wane'. 'What you see now in central Europe with these rapid increase in cases, you see the importance of vaccination,' Mr Edmund told Sky. But Mr Edmund said the UK was unlikely to be hit by the Christmas chaos because the country 'is in a slightly different position.' He added: 'Frankly here in the UK, we've had high rates of infection for many months now so we're in a slightly different position to Austria and Germany and so on. 'I don't think things will quite happen in the same way here as they have done there. But it is a warning to us. I think it's pretty clear that immunity does wane. 'I'm sure you do still have some protection from the vaccine but it's nowhere near as strong as shortly after you've been vaccinated. It's very clear the booster doses do give a very clear boost to your immune system.' Asked whether the Government should re-introduce control measures, Mr Edmund told Sky: 'The plan B measures, we could've implemented them at any point. It's a government decision whether to take that step. 'They have to look at the potential effectiveness and measure that against the potential cost of some of those things.' Advertisement Riot police carrying shields and batons were directing groups of people away from the area. Officers on horseback and in police vans patrolled the streets. Police also cordoned off several scenes to comb for evidence, with a human finger visible on the ground at one of them, the AFP correspondent said. 'Most of the demonstrators are now gone. There only remain a few groups in a few places,' police spokesman Jesse Brobbel told AFP. Dutch justice minister Ferd Grapperhaus said in a statement that the 'extreme violence' against police and fire fighters in Rotterdam was 'repulsive'. 'The right to protest is very important in our society but what we saw last night was simply criminal behaviour,' Grapperhaus said. Dutch police said units from around the country were brought in to 'restore order' to Rotterdam. 'Dozens of arrests have now been made, it is expected that more arrests will follow. Around seven people have been injured, including on the side of the police,' a police statement said. At least one police car was set on fire during the protest, a police spokesman confirmed to AFP. The spokesperson could not confirm the number of people injured. Several electric scooters and other items were also torched, with several hundred protesters involved in the riots, images on Dutch media and social media showed. Local authorities issued an emergency order banning people from gathering in the area in a bid to prevent further violence, and the authorities also called on bystanders and people who recorded images of the riots to send the footage to police for further investigation. Police tweeted that rioters started fires and threw fireworks during the rioting and authorities closed the city's main railway station. The several hundred people had gathered to voice opposition to government plans to restrict access to indoor venues to people who have a 'corona pass' showing they have been vaccinated or already recovered from an infection. The pass is also available to people who have not been vaccinated, but have proof of a negative test. 'This is a very serious situation which requires action with the highest priority,' said the emergency order by the Rotterdam municipality. 'It is therefore necessary to issue this emergency order so as to maintain public order and to protect the safety of persons.'

It announced that the daily tally jumped to 22,936 on Friday, almost 500 more than the previous record set on Tuesday. The country's infection rate has risen to 929 new cases per 100,000 residents over the past seven days. In a worrying sign, 110 people died on Thursday, the ministry said, with the daily death toll surpassing 100 for the first time since April. The government has approved new restrictions to tackle the surge, targeting the unvaccinated in an effort to increase a vaccination rate that is below the European Union average. Starting on Monday, most unvaccinated people will no longer be allowed to show negative coronavirus tests in order to attend public events, go to bars and restaurants, visit hairdressers, museums and similar facilities or use hotels. Only people who are vaccinated or have recovered from Covid-19 will remain eligible. Overall, the nation of 10.7 million has registered almost two million cases with 32,005 deaths. Advertisement Local political party Leefbaar Rotterdam condemned the violence in a tweet. 'The centre of our beautiful city has this evening transformed into a war zone,' it said. 'Rotterdam is a city where you can disagree with things that happen but violence is never, never, the solution.' Like much of the rest of Europe, the Netherlands has seen Covid cases soar to record levels in recent days, with more than 21,000 new infections reported on Friday. The latest restrictions were announced on November 12, and sparked clashes between demonstrators and police outside the justice ministry in The Hague. The restrictions came into force the following day, shuttering bars, restaurants, cafes and supermarkets at 8:00 pm daily, while non-essential shops must shut at 6:00 pm. People are limited to having four visitors at home and have been advised to work at home unless absolutely necessary. Public events have been scrapped while football matches must be played behind closed doors. Schools however remain open, and people are allowed to leave their homes without restrictions. The Dutch government has said it will review the situation on December 3. It is considering excluding the unvaccinated from bars and restaurants, limiting admittance to people who have been vaccinated or who have recovered from the disease, but there was significant opposition to the plan during a debate in parliament this week. The Netherlands suffered its worst riots in four decades in January after a night-time Covid curfew, the country's first since World War II, came into force. Earlier Friday, the government banned fireworks on Dec. 31 for the second straight year. The ban is intended 'to prevent, as much as possible, extra strain on health care, law enforcement and first responders,' the government said Friday. The riots in Rotterdam come after Austria said on Friday that it will become the first country in western Europe to reimpose a full Covid-19 lockdown, while neighbouring Germany warned it may follow suit, sending shivers through financial markets worried about the economic fallout. Restrictions have also been placed on the unvaccinated in Germany – where they have been banned from restaurants – as well as in the Czech Republic and Slovakia.

'The situation is very, very serious and difficult,' Markus Soeder, premier of the southern state of Bavaria, said as he also announced a shutdown of clubs, bars and night service at restaurants. The eastern state of Saxony unveiled similar measures and went even further by closing all sporting and cultural venues, banning tourism, public consumption of alcohol and barring the unvaccinated from non-essential shops and hairdressers. Saxony premier Michael Kretschmer - whose state has Germany's lowest vaccination rate at just under 60 percent of the population - admitted that many of the restrictions would affect the vaccinated as well. But he said tough action was needed to keep hospitals from being overwhelmed and called for 'solidarity' from all citizens. 'We need more 'we' and less 'I' in this pandemic,' he told reporters. Bavaria and Saxony are among the hardest hit regions in the ferocious fourth Covid wave sweeping Germany. Reporting by AFP Advertisement Following the announcement, Freedom Party leader Herbert Kickl posted a picture on Facebook with the inscription: 'As of today Austria is a dictatorship.' The party is planning a protest on Saturday, but Kickl cannot attend because he has tested positive for Covid-19 and must self-isolate for 14 days. Europe has again become the epicentre of the pandemic, accounting for half of global cases and deaths, the WHO said. A fourth wave of infections has plunged Germany, Europe's largest economy, into a national emergency, Health Minister Jens Spahn said, warning that vaccinations alone will not cut case numbers. Both decisions infuriated many in a country where scepticism about state mandates affecting individual freedoms runs high, encouraged by the far-right Freedom Party, the third biggest in parliament. Asked if Germany could rule out an Austrian-style full lockdown, Spahn said: 'We are now in a situation - even if this produces a news alert - where we can't rule anything out. 'We are in a national emergency,' he told a news conference. Looming lockdowns weighed on a range of financial market sectors on Friday, pushing stocks and oil down and boosting the dollar. 'We expect targeted measures (against COVID-19) across some countries mainly according to the health situation, but other factors, such as domestic political situations, will be relevant,' Oxford Economics analysts said in a note. 'And while it might take a while before a political consensus can be reached in other countries, it is clear that the tide has turned.' As cases rise again, a number of European governments have started to reimpose limits on activity, ranging from Austria's full lockdown to a partial lockdown in the Netherlands and restrictions on the unvaccinated in parts of Germany, the Czech Republic and Slovakia. Niels Van Regenmortel, the intensive care units coordinator at the ZNA Stuivenberg hospital in Antwerp, said there was an increasing risk hospitals in Belgium will have to resort to triage as ICUs fill up amid soaring COVID-19 numbers, calling on the government to restrict night life.

It reveals that Sweden is in the bottom half of countries for vaccine uptake, but ahead of nations including the UK and Germany Europe has become the epicentre of the pandemic once again, with the World Health Organisation warning that the Continent was the only region in the world where deaths had increased - with Covid-related fatalities spiking by five per cent just this week What Covid restrictions are in place in Sweden? The country- which dodged a lockdown unlike most other nations - also has next to no Covid restrictions in place. It dropped its final measures recommending people to work from home where possible on September 29. And advice for people to wear face masks on public transport was abandoned on July. Unlike in other countries the coverings were never compulsory. On November 11 Swedish health authorities went even further telling double-vaccinated people they no longer needed to swab themselves for the virus. But this move has now been reversed after critics said it left the country in a dangerous position just before winter. Some travel restrictions are still in place for people coming to the country from non-EU nations and Britain. All arrivals are required to show a certificate they have been double-vaccinated. When this is not possible they are asked to show a negative Covid test result from to come to the country from non-EU countries. All arrivals are also required to prove they up to 48 hours before they travelled. Sweden will impose further restrictions from December 1 requiring everyone attending events of more than 100 people to show proof they are double-vaccinated. Officials have warned more Covid restrictions may be needed this winter. Advertisement Whether or not countries opt to lock down again depends on a wide range of factors, including vaccination rates, mask mandates and the extent to which booster shots are being made available. Germany has said further measures will be decided based on when hospitalisation rates hit certain thresholds, while Friday saw its first states - Saxony and Bavaria - cancel all their Christmas markets. The Bavarian state capital of Munich on Tuesday had become the first major German city to cancel its Christmas market for the second year in a row. Saxony's cancellations means the famed Dresden Christmas market is also scrapped. Germany hosts some 2,500 Christmas markets each year, cherished by visitors who come to savour mulled wine and roasted chestnuts, and shop for seasonal trinkets among clusters of wooden chalets. In pre-pandemic times, they drew about 160 million domestic and international visitors annually who brought in revenues of three to five billion euros ($3.4 billion to $5.6 billion), according to the BSM stallkeepers' industry association. In France, President Emmanuel Macron has made it clear he thinks high levels of vaccinations should be enough to avoid future lockdowns. Britain, with higher numbers of infections than most countries in Europe, is rolling out third shots - or boosters - to offset waning protection from the first two and help keep the economy open. While the new measures across Europe are not seen hitting the economy as much as the all-out lockdowns of last year, analysts say they could weigh on the recovery in the last quarter, especially if they hurt the retail and hospitality sectors over Christmas. A full lockdown in Germany would be more serious, however. 'With Germany ... imposing new restrictions, any thoughts that the vaccines would offer a way to a more normal Christmas period appear to have gone up in smoke for now, in Europe at least,' said Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK. 'Although there is a nagging fear this could ripple out across the region.' The pressure on intensive care units in Germany has not yet reached its peak, Spahn said, urging people to reduce contacts to help break the wave. 'How Christmas will turn out, I dare not say. I can only say it's up to us,' he added.

A couple hug and laugh as they have lunch in a restaurant in Stockholm, Sweden EU issues advice on using Covid-19 pill for adults The European Union's drug regulator has issued advice on using Merck's COVID-19 pill for adults and began a review of a rival tablet from Pfizer to help member states decide on quick adoption ahead of any formal EU-wide approval. In two separate statements on Friday, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) detailed efforts to advance use of the experimental but promising options, as infections and COVID-related deaths are rapidly rising in the region and forcing renewed lockdowns. Merck's COVID-19 tablet, Lagevrio, developed with Ridgeback Biotherapeutics, should be given early and within five days of first symptoms to treat adults who do not need oxygen support and are at risk of their disease worsening. It advised against treatment during pregnancy and for women who plan to or could get pregnant, while adding that breastfeeding must also be stopped around the time of using the pill, which is to be taken twice a day for five days. Drugs in the same class as Merck's Lagevrio have been linked to birth defects in animal studies. The drugmaker, known as MSD outside the United States and Canada, has said animal testing shows its pill is safe, but the data have not been made public. EMA said it was studying available data on the Pfizer pill Paxlovid, days after the drugmaker sought U.S. approval, adding that a more comprehensive rolling review was expected to start ahead of any approval. It did not specify when that review would be. The EMA last month began a rolling review of the Merck pill and expects to conclude that evaluation by the end of the year. Advertisement Chancellor Angela Merkel said on Thursday Germany will limit large parts of public life in areas where hospitals are becoming dangerously full of COVID-19 patients to those who have either been vaccinated or have recovered from the illness. 'It's clear from our experience in England and from what's happening across Europe that while vaccines do a lot of the heavy lifting ... other interventions are required to prevent case numbers rising,' said Lawrence Young, virologist and professor of molecular oncology at the University of Warwick. 'Less mask wearing, more mixing indoors due to colder weather and waning immunity are also contributing to the high case levels across Europe.' Sweden, meanwhile, has the lowest Covid infection rate in western Europe — after double-vaccinated nationals were told they don't have to test for the virus even if they get symptoms. The Scandinavian nation — which was subject to international scrutiny last year when it refused to lockdown — is currently recording 85.4 cases per million people, according to Oxford University research site Our World in Data. By comparison, the rate is nearly 1,400 per million in Europe's current Covid capital Austria, which today announced it is going back into a full lockdown from Monday. Sweden's infection rate is far lower than other Western European countries like the Netherlands (1,048.7), Britain (581), Germany (536), and France (201). And for the first time in the pandemic, Sweden is recording fewer cases per population size than its Scandinavian neighbours Denmark (655), Norway (351) and Finland (150). But critics say Sweden has been left 'in the dark' over the true extent of its coronavirus wave because the double-vaccinated, equivalent to almost seven in ten people, are not being routinely swabbed. Last week, Sweden broke ranks with its European neighbours once again and told Swedes they did not have to get tested if they were fully jabbed, even if they had symptoms. Covid swabbing rates plunged 35 per cent last week, compared to a month earlier. But this week the policy was reversed in response to rising cases on the continent. A fresh wave of Delta is rolling across the continent and putting pressure on hospitals once again, which has forced most in the EU to bring back some form of curbs. Latest figures show Sweden is only carrying out 1.26 tests per 1,000 people, which is also the lowest number in western Europe. The threat of fresh lockdowns comes as optimism grows about experimental drugs developed by Pfizer and Merck that cut the chance of hospitalisation and severe illness, more weapons in the world's fight against the virus. On Friday, the EU drug regulator said it was reviewing data on Pfizer's COVID-19 pill to help member states decide on quick adoption ahead of any formal EU-wide approval. Slovakia has also seen a surge in infections, with 9,171 reported on Friday, its biggest daily tally since the pandemic began. The country of 5.5 million earlier in the week tightened restrictions on people who have not had COVID-19 shots. With a seven-day incidence of 11,500 new cases per million inhabitants, the country has the worst reported epidemic situation in the world, according to Our World in Data statistics."", ""Europe descended into a third day of violent carnage on Sunday as tens of thousands of people in Belgium took to the streets to protest against the return of strict lockdown rules aimed at curbing a rise in Covid infections. Nearly 40,000 people descended on the capital Brussels to protest against new anti-Covid measures banning the unvaccinated from entering restaurants and bars. Some protesters were seen throwing projectiles at riot police and in response, officers fired water cannon and tear gas at the group. Police have made some arrests, but it is not immediately clear how many. Video footage from Brussels shows a large group of protesters shouting at police as some light flares and throw them at the officers. One man can even be seen mooning at them. The protests descended into chaos, with some of the protesters seen setting fires on the streets while others threw rocks through the windows of local businesses including a post office. Two police cars have also been damaged. The protest came just hours after it emerged Germany is set to follow Austria's example in making vaccinations compulsory with ministers admitting that the move is 'unavoidable' amid a fourth wave of the pandemic which is crippling the country's hospitals. Last night also saw similar demonstrations against virus restrictions take place in Austria, Switzerland, Croatia, Italy, Northern Ireland, Austria and North Macedonia on Saturday, a day after Dutch police opened fire on protesters and seven people were injured in rioting that erupted in Rotterdam. Europe has become the epicentre of the pandemic once again, with the World Health Organisation warning that the Continent was the only region in the world where deaths had increased as Covid-related fatalities spiked by five per cent just this week. In France, the government has warned that the fifth wave of coronavirus are rising at 'lightning speed', with new daily Covid cases close to doubling over the past week. In Belgium, cases have been surging, with infections reaching 13,836 on Sunday. In response, the government has introduced restrictions including a ban on the unvaccinated from venues such as restaurants and bars, and an order to work from home at least four days a week. Police said 35,000 protesters marched from the North Station in Brussels on Sunday afternoon against a fresh round of Covid measures announced by the government on Wednesday. The demonstration, called 'Together for Freedom', saw some protesters clash with riot police near the Belgian capital's EU and government district. Many of the protesters caught up in the clash were wearing hoods and carried Flemish nationalist flags. A total of 42 people were detained and two were arrested in the riots. Meanwhile, three police officers were injured and taken to hospital and one protester was hurt after a firework exploded in his hand.

Several police officers were injured after protesters threw bottles and fireworks at them. Last week, Belgium's Prime Minister Last week, Belgium's Prime Minister Alexander De Croo said 'the alarm signals are all red' as he imposed tough restrictions, ordering people to work at home for at least four days a week. Under new restrictions, all people in indoor venues such as cafes and restaurants will need to wear a mask unless seated and the rule will apply to those aged 10 or older. The previous age threshold was 12. Nightclubs may have to test their guests if they want to let them dance mask-free. People wanting to eat in a restaurant or go to the theatre already must present a COVID pass, showing vaccination, a negative test or recent recovery. Most Belgians will also have to work from home four days a week until mid-December, and for three days after that. Belgium has one of the highest cases per capita rates in the European Union, behind only the Baltic and former Yugoslav nations and Austria, at around one per hundred people over the past 14 days, according to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control. 'The alarm signals are all red,' prime minister Alexander De Croo told a news conference. 'We had all hoped to have a winter without coronavirus, but Belgium is not an island.' Niels Van Regenmortel, the intensive care units coordinator at the ZNA Stuivenberg hospital in Antwerp, said there was an increasing risk hospitals in Belgium will have to resort to triage as ICUs fill up amid soaring COVID-19 numbers, calling on the government to restrict night life. In Germany, the number of Covid cases are soaring daily, with the country reporting 48,201 infections on Saturday - the highest number of new coronavirus cases since the beginning of the pandemic. The fourth wave is overwhelming hospitals, with health chiefs warning that the situation is 'extremely critical' across the country. In France, fifth-wave coronavirus infections are rising at an alarming rate, the government reported Sunday, with new daily Covid cases close to doubling over the past week. In Germany, a relatively low vaccination rate - hovering under 70 per cent - has left the country vulnerable to the virus. Germany's federal tourism commissioner Thomas Bareiß has now said the worsening situation makes it clear that compulsory vaccination is 'unavoidable'. Bareiß told DPA news agency: 'In retrospect, it was wrong not to see that right from the start. The hope at that time is understandable, but it was not realistic.' His calls were echoed by the Prime Minister of Bavaria, which has seen Covid cases surge, who said 'in the end we will not be able to avoid compulsory vaccination'. The above graph shows the Covid infection rate per million people for western European countries from November last year.

Pictured: Protesters in Brussels on Sunday Riot police raise their shields as they clash with protesters on a bridge in Brussels on Sunday during anti-vaccine demonstrations Thousands of protesters, many of them peaceful, marched through the streets of Brussels on Sunday. Some held signs which read 'Stand up for your rights' and 'Stop the madness' Mr Bareiß, the tourism commissioner of Germany's federal government, said a compulsory vaccination is 'unavoidable'. Putin tells Russia he had Covid booster jab Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Sunday he had taken a third dose of a Covid vaccine, as the country struggled with a fresh wave of the virus. 'I had it two hours ago,' Putin said on state television channel Rossiya 24, assuring viewers that his booster injection of the Sputnik vaccine had been painless. The authorities are struggling to convince people to get vaccinated against Covid, even as a fresh wave of the virus is killing record numbers every day. Even though Russia has several vaccines that it has manufactured itself, only 36.7 percent of the population is fully vaccinated, according to the Gogov website, which tracks the data. Putin, who said he opposes universal mandatory vaccination, has backed measures taken in some regions for certain people. For example, in June, authorities in Moscow said vaccination would be obligatory for anyone working in the service sector. Russia recorded more than 9.3 million cases of Covid and just over 264,000 deaths, which makes it the worst-hit country in Europe. The actual toll from the pandemic there was closer to 450,000 at the end of September, according to figures from the Rosstat statistics agency however, which works with a broader definition of Covid-linked deaths. Advertisement He said: 'For me it is politically no longer justifiable that entire industries, retailers, restaurants, clubs, bars and the entire cinema, cultural and event scene live in a state of crisis prescribed by the state for 20 months and are faced with great existential fears, while others are concerned take the freedom not to vaccinate. 'So far, historical measures and sums of money have been able to save many companies. That doesn't work in the long run.' In Bavaria, there has been a 'dramatic' coronavirus resurgence. It prompted the Bavarian state capital of Munich to become the first major German city to cancel its Christmas market, which usually draws some three million visitors. The Bavarian Prime Minister Markus Söder said he believes the country will 'not be able to avoid' compulsory vaccination. He told Berliner Zeitung: 'I believe that in the end we will not be able to avoid compulsory vaccination. Otherwise it will be an endless loop with this coronavirus.' The director of Frankfurt University Hospital said the situation in intensive care units in the state of Hesse is 'critical'. Jürgen Graf, who is also the head of the planning staff for the inpatient care of Covid patients in Hesse at the Ministry of Health, told Bild: 'The situation is extremely critical. What we are currently doing is crisis management.' He added: 'This is not a problem for Covid patients, it affects everyone,' explaining that inpatient care and the care of emergency patients are 'impaired' due to longer wait times. The warning comes as a hospital in Bavaria's Freising last week made the unprecedented decision to transfer a Covid-19 patient to northern Italy because it 'had no more capacity to receive them, and the surrounding hospitals were also full.' Almost one per cent of the new infections end up in the intensive care unit, Graf said. 'Given the current number of infections, that would be 50 or more patients per week in addition to the approximately 250 patients treated there today,' he added. 'Then in a few weeks we will be well above last winter's high.' The fourth wave is overwhelming hospitals, with health chiefs warning that the situation is 'extremely critical' across the country. Pictured: Doctors and nurses tend to a patient on the Covid-19 intensive care unit at University Hospital Leipzig on November 18 THE NETHERLANDS: A day after Rotterdam rioting that saw seven people injured, thousands more took to Amsterdam's central Dam Square and The Hague (pictured above), with seven arrests being made according to police AUSTRIA: Protesters carrying a banner reading 'Control the border. Not your people' at the anti-lockdown demonstration held by the far-right Freedom Party in Vienna today The fourth wave of infections has plunged Germany, Europe's largest economy, into a national emergency, Health Minister Jens Spahn said. He urged people to reduce their social contacts, warning that vaccinations alone would not reduce case numbers. Asked if Germany could rule out an Austrian-style full lockdown, Spahn said: 'We are now in a situation - even if this produces a news alert - where we can't rule anything out. 'We are in a national emergency,' he told a news conference. Their comments come after the upper house of parliament on Friday approved new measures to control the outbreak proposed by the centre-left alliance that emerged after the September 26 national election. Three people treated in hospital and inquiry launched after Dutch police fired warning shots during Rotterdam riots Three people were being treated in hospital in Rotterdam on Saturday after they were seriously injured when Dutch police fired shots during a violent protest against COVID-19 measures, authorities said. Crowds of several hundred rioters torched cars, set off fireworks and threw rocks at police during the protests on Friday evening. Police responded with warning shots and water canons. Rotterdam police posted on Twitter on Saturday that 51 people had been arrested, half of whom were under 18. 'Three rioters were wounded when they were hit by bullets, they remain in hospital,' police added, in an update after earlier reporting two wounded. Authorities are investigating the shootings including whether the wounded people where hit by police bullets, they added. The city's mayor, Ahmed Aboutaleb, said the protest had turned into 'an orgy of violence.' 'Police were forced to draw their weapons and even fire direct shots,' he told a news conference early on Saturday. Dutch Justice Minister Ferd Grapperhaus said in a statement the 'extreme violence' against police and firefighters in Rotterdam was 'repulsive.' 'The right to protest is very important in our society but what we saw last night was simply criminal behaviour,' Grapperhaus said. Protesters had gathered to voice opposition to government plans to restrict access to indoor venues to people who have a 'corona pass,' showing they have been vaccinated or have already recovered from an infection. The pass is also available to people who have not been vaccinated, but have proof of a negative test. Advertisement The measures include requirements for people to prove they are vaccinated, recently recovered from Covid-19 or have tested negative for the virus in order to access communal workplaces or public transport. Separately, outgoing Chancellor Angela Merkel agreed with the governors of Germany's 16 states to introduce a new threshold linked to the number of hospital admissions of Covid-19 patients per 100,000 people over a seven-day period. The new three-tier system would require people to show evidence of a vaccination or previous infection to enter public buildings or businesses in states where hospitalisation rates go above 3 in 100,000 people, based on a seven-day average. At present, that will affect 9 of Germany's 16 states. In France, the seven-day average of new cases reached 17,153 on Saturday, up from 9,458 a week earlier, according to the health authorities, an increase of 81 percent. 'The fifth wave is starting at lightning speed,' government spokesman Gabrial Attal said. The latest seven-day increase is three times the average rise of cases recorded over the previous three weeks, indicating an exponential acceleration of infections. For now the spike in infections has not led to a massive influx of Covid patients into hospitals, with the authorities attributing the limited number of intensive care patients to France's high rate of vaccinations which appear highly effective against the most dangerous forms of Covid. On Saturday, hospitals reported a total of 7,974 Covid patients in their care, with 1,333 of them in intensive treatment. This compares to 6,500 and 1,000, respectively, a month earlier. 'There is a very strong increase in infections, but we also know that in France we have a very large vaccination cover,' he said. 'We seem to be ahead of our neighbours concerning booster shots.' France's introduction of a health pass ahead of other countries in the summer was also helping to keep Covid in check, he said. The health pass, required in French restaurants, cafes and many cultural venues, certifies that a person is fully vaccinated, has recently recovered from Covid, or has tested negative for the virus. The government continues to stand by its choice to 'bring the weight of restrictions to bear on non-vaccinated people rather than vaccinated people', Attal said Last night, Europe descended into a second night of violent carnage amid the return of strict lockdown rules aimed at curbing rising rates of Covid infection. Thousands of people took to Amsterdam's central Dam Square and the Hague on Saturday, a day after the 'orgy of violence' during the Rotterdam riots that saw seven people injured. Police said seven arrests were made on Sunday after youths set streets ablaze and shot fireworks at officers. Video footage from the Hague showed motorists sounding their horns in support as a trio of small explosions could be clearly seen on the main road in the background. Elsewhere, protesters were pictured ripping down street signs in chaotic scenes. Anti-riot police were forced to clear the wreckage of smouldering scooters and burnt-out bicycles that were torched by the anti-vax mob and left to block roads in one of the worst outbreaks of violence in the country since Covid restrictions were first implemented. Meanwhile, similar demonstrations against virus restrictions also took place in Switzerland, Croatia, Italy, Northern Ireland, Austria and North Macedonia on Saturday, a day after Dutch police opened fire on protesters and seven people were injured in rioting that erupted in Rotterdam. It comes as violence broke out in Vienna on Saturday as 10,000 protesters - many from far-right groups - took to the streets to demonstrate against new Covid-19 restrictions and mandatory vaccinations. Police were pictured arresting two protesters. A spokesman said there had been fewer than 10 arrests, for breaches of coronavirus restrictions and the ban on Nazi symbols. Some protesters mockingly wore doctor's scrubs, while others wore the yellow stars as badges in reference to Nazi Germany's policy of forcing Jews to wear the badge as identification. Chanting 'resistance!', waving Austrian flags and blowing whistles, the crowd swelled to more than 30,000. Many held signs mocking government leaders including Chancellor Alexander Schallenberg and Health Minister Wolfgang Mueckstein. Protesters rallied against coronavirus restrictions and mandatory COVID-19 passes needed in many European countries to enter restaurants, Christmas markets or sports events, as well as mandatory vaccinations. The Austrian protest, which was promoted by the far-right opposition Freedom Party, became violent and five police officers were injured - a development which Austria's Interior Minister Karl Nehammer slammed as 'unacceptable'. Nehammer told a press conference on Sunday morning: 'If at a meeting that is organised and promoted by a parliamentary party, where police officers are attacked and Nazi crimes are played down by wearing the Jewish star, that is unacceptable.' The protesters had worn the yellow Jewish star as badges, with the words 'unvaccinated' stitched on, as they compared the lockdown and mandatory vaccination measures with the atrocities of the Nazi era. Nehammer said: 'This is not only completely tasteless, it plays down the crimes of the National Socialists and offends the millions of victims of the Nazi dictatorship and their families.' The interior minister said some of the protesters were from right-wing extremist groups, with some setting fire to a police car and confessing that they 'wanted to burn a police officer'. 'This is an extent of radicalisation that is by no means acceptable,' Nehammer said, adding that the police officers 'professionally ensured security in a difficult mission'. AUSTRIA: Thousands of residents - one holding a sign reading 'no to mandatory vaccination' - today gathered in Vienna to demonstrate against new Covid restrictions amid soaring infection rates across the continent In Italy, 3,000 turned out in the capital's Circus Maximus, a field where in ancient times Romans staged popular entertainment, to protest against 'Green Pass' certificates required at workplaces, restaurants, cinemas, theaters, sports venues and gyms, as well as for long-distance train, bus or ferry travel within Italy. In Northern Ireland, several hundred people opposed to vaccine passports protested outside the city hall in Belfast, where the city's Christmas market opened Saturday - a market where proof of vaccination or a negative COVID-19 test was required. The Northern Ireland government voted this week to introduce vaccine certificates for admission to nightclubs, bars and restaurants starting Dec. 13. 'People like us never give up,' read one banner, in the red, white and green colors of the Italian flag. Virtually no one at the Rome protest wore a protective mask. Switzerland saw 2,000 people protest an upcoming referendum on whether to approve the government's COVID-19 restrictions law, claiming it was discriminatory, public broadcaster SRF reported. In Croatia, thousands gathered at in the capital Zagreb, carrying Croatian flags, nationalist and religious symbols, along with banners against vaccination and what they describe as restrictions of people's freedoms. And in Denmark, more than one thousand gathered outside the Danish parliament in Copenhagen to push back against the reintroduction of the national health pass. North Macedonia also saw hundreds of anti-vaccination protesters march in downtown Skopje on Satruday evening against the country's health authority's recommendation of mandatory vaccinations. Demonstrations against virus measures are also expected in other European countries - the latest in rising anger at the re-introduction of restrictions amid soaring cases on the continent. This comes as the World Health Organization (WHO) said it was 'very worried' about the spread of Covid-19 within Europe as the continent battles a fresh wave of infections. Regional director Dr Hans Kluge told the BBC that some 500,000 more deaths could be recorded by March unless urgent action is taken.

The island's prefect on Friday introduced the night-time stay-at-home order after protests against the coronavirus vaccine pass spiralled into violence the previous night. But the measure did little to quell the rioting. 'The night was very turbulent,' a police source said. The security forces recorded 'some 20 incidents of looting or attempted robbery' in the seaside towns of Pointe-a-Pitre and Le Gosier, including at a jewellery shop, a bank, a betting shop and a shopping centre. In the town of Saint-Francois to the east, 'gendarmes coming out of the station were threatened by blazing projectiles'. A second source within the gendarmerie said an armoury had been looted. The first source said 'firearms were used against police forces in four different areas' across the island, and one member was slightly wounded after a stone hit him in the face. In the area of Le Petit-Bourg to the west, firemen had to put out fires in two mobile phone stores, which had also been plundered. The interior ministry said 31 people had been arrested. France late Saturday said it was sending around 50 personnel from both its RAID elite police force and its GIGN counter-terrorism unit to Guadeloupe. The doctors' union in Guadeloupe warned against further trouble while the health system was so 'fragile'. They criticised 'individuals who may have prevented patients from getting access to treatment, or medical staff from reaching their place of practice'. While most people in mainland France have now received two vaccination doses, rates in its overseas territories have lagged behind. By November 16, some 46 percent of adults in Guadeloupe had received at least one jab of a vaccine against Covid. Advertisement Five police officers were injured during rioting at the Hague, with one taken to hospital suffering concussion and two suffering hearing damage from loud fireworks,. A rock thrown by rioters also smashed the window of a passing ambulance carrying a patient, the city's police force said. Elsewhere in the Netherlands, two football matches in the Eredivise, the top professional league, were briefly halted after fans - banned from matches under a partial lockdown in force in the Netherlands for a week - broke into stadiums in the towns of Alkmaar and Almelo. Earlier Saturday, two protests against COVID-19 measures went off peacefully in Amsterdam and the southern city of Breda. Police said in a tweet that seven people were arrested in The Hague and five officers were injured. One needed treatment in a hospital. Local media reported that rioters threw bicycles, wooden pallets and motorized scooters on one of the fires. The chaos in The Hague was on a smaller scale than the pitched battles on the streets of Rotterdam on Friday night, when police said that three rioters were hit by bullets and investigations were underway to establish if they were shot by police. Officers in Rotterdam arrested 51 people, about half of them minors, police said Saturday afternoon. One police officer was hospitalized with a leg injury sustained in the rioting, another was treated by ambulance staff and 'countless' others suffered minor injuries. Mayor Ahmed Aboutaleb told reporters in the early hours of Saturday morning that 'on a number of occasions the police felt it necessary to draw their weapons to defend themselves' as rioters rampaged through the port city's central shopping district, setting fires and throwing rocks and fireworks at officers. 'They shot at protesters, people were injured,' Aboutaleb said. He did not have details on the injuries. Police also fired warning shots. Justice Minister Ferd Grapperhaus condemned the events. 'The riots and extreme violence against police officers, riot police and firefighters last night in Rotterdam are disgusting to see,' he said in a statement. 'Protesting is a great right in our society, but what we saw last night is simply criminal behavior. It has nothing to do with demonstrating,' he added. An independent investigation into the shootings by police was opened, as is the case whenever Dutch police use their weapons. As the march kicked off on Vienna's Heldenplatz, thousands of protesters gathered on the massive square. About 1,300 police officers were on duty. They used loudspeakers to tell protesters masks were required, but most did not wear them. Chanting 'resistance!' and blowing whistles, protesters began to move slowly down the city's inner ring road. Many waved Austrian flags and carried signs mocking government leaders like Chancellor Alexander Schallenberg and Health Minister Wolfgang Mueckstein. Some wore doctor's scrubs; others donned tinfoil hats. Most of the signs focused on the newly announced vaccine mandate: 'My Body, My Choice,' read one. 'We're Standing Up for Our Kids!' said another. By mid-afternoon the crowds had swelled to roughly 35,000 people, according to the police, and were marching down Vienna's inner ring road before heading back towards the Hofburg. Police were pictured arresting two protesters. A spokesman said there had been fewer than 10 arrests, for breaches of coronavirus restrictions and the ban on Nazi symbols. Meanwhile, a few hundred protesters gathered in Amsterdam today and a similar number marched through the southern city of Breda over the latest Covid-19 measures. Riots also erupted in the central 'Bible Belt' town of Urk and cities in southern Limburg province, while angry fans disrupted two football matches being played behind closed doors because of coronavirus rules, Dutch media said. It comes after violent riots last night in which 51 were arrested in Rotterdam after thousands of anti-lockdown protesters gathered on one of the city's main shopping streets. Dutch police fired water canons, 'warning shots' and bullets at protesters to disperse the crowd who had lit fires and set off fireworks. Police confirmed seven injuries, including officers, in the violence but did not say if live ammunition or rubber bullets were fired. The Netherlands re-imposed some lockdown measures last weekend for an initial three weeks in an effort to slow a resurgence of coronavirus contagion, but daily infections have remained at their highest levels since the start of the pandemic. The Dutch government has said it wants to introduce a law that would allow businesses to restrict the country's coronavirus pass system to only people who are fully vaccinated or have recovered from Covid-19 - that would exclude people who test negative. The violent scenes in Rotterdam mirrored much of the continent's reaction to similar schemes announced by Austria, Germany, the Czech Republic, and Slovakia - with Italy and Greece also reportedly considering moves to restrict the movements of unvaccinated people.

The lockdown, which comes into effect on Monday, constitutes the toughest restrictions introduced in Europe in recent weeks as Covid-19 cases surge continent-wide, fuelled by vaccine resistance. Austrians will not be allowed to leave home except to go to work, shop for essentials and exercise. The restrictions will initially last 20 days with an evaluation after 10 days, Chancellor Alexander Schallenberg said. Vaccination against Covid-19 in the Alpine nation will be mandatory from February 1 next year, Schallenberg said. So far, the Vatican alone in Europe has imposed a vaccination mandate. The World Health Organization continues to favour policies that 'demonstrate the benefit and safety of vaccines for the greatest possible acceptance of vaccines, rather than imposed mandatory vaccination,' spokeswoman Fadela Chaib told reporters in Geneva. Austria has already imposed movement restrictions on those not vaccinated or recently recovered from the virus, ordering them to stay at home since Monday, becoming the first EU country to do so. But infections have continued to rise. On Friday, a new record of more than 15,800 new cases was recorded in the EU member of nearly nine million people. Reporting by AFP Advertisement Austrians are protesting against a new national lockdown and mandatory vaccinations, which the government said yesterday would be rolled out on February 1. Vaccinations in Austria have plateaued at one of the lowest rates in Western Europe - under 66 per cent - and hospitals in heavily hit states have warned that their intensive care units are reaching capacity. Austrian Chancellor Alexander Schallenberg said yesterday the country would go in lockdown for 10 days. The shutdown will then reevaluated and could be extended for a further 10 days. Most stores will close, and cultural events will be canceled. People will be able to leave their homes only for certain specific reasons, including buying groceries, going to the doctor or exercising. Average daily deaths have tripled in recent weeks and its infections are among the highest in Europe, with a seven-day incidence of 991 per 100,000 people. 'We have not succeeded in convincing enough people to get vaccinated,' Chancellor Alexander Schallenberg told a news conference. 'It hurts that such measures still have to be taken.' Schallenberg also apologised to all vaccinated people on Friday night saying it was not fair they had to suffer under the renewed lockdown restrictions when they had done everything to help contain the virus. 'I'm sorry to take this drastic step,' he said on public broadcaster ORF. Despite the violence a day earlier, around 300 protesters marched through the southern Dutch town of Breda near the Belgian border on Saturday carrying banners with slogans such as 'No Lockdown'. Organisers said they opposed Prime Minister Mark Rutte's plans to exclude the unvaccinated from bars and restaurants. A group that had called an Amsterdam protest for Saturday, United We Stand Europe, said on Facebook it had cancelled the rally because 'last night, all hell broke loose in Rotterdam'. But several hundred flag-waving protesters still gathered in central Dam Square, watched over by police vans, according to Dutch media and images on social media.

Local news outlet NL Times reported that a journalist was attacked of the street, while local broadcaster Rijnmond said the reporter was beaten and his camera was destroyed. Local media also reported gangs of soccer hooligans were involved in the rioting. One eyewitness - a press photographer – told local media they saw shell casings 'everywhere on the floor'. Cops also said it was 'unclear how or by whom' two people were shot during the chaos. Video from social media on Dutch broadcaster NOS appeared to show the person being hit in Rotterdam, but there was no explanation on what happened. Officers arrested 51 protesters last night and were expected to detain several more after studying video footage from security cameras. Late on Friday night, police said downtown Rotterdam remained restive and there was still a heavy police presence on the streets. Mayor Ahmed Aboutaleb told reporters in the early hours of Saturday morning that 'on a number of occasions the police felt it necessary to draw their weapons to defend themselves' as rioters ran rampage through the port city's central shopping district, setting fires and throwing rocks and fireworks at officers. 'They shot at protesters, people were injured,' Aboutaleb said, adding that several officers were injured in the violence. Police spokesperson Patricia Wessels confirmed that police fired shots, though it was not immediately clear what type of rounds were fired. 'We fired warning shots and there were also direct shots fired because the situation was life-threatening,' she said. 'We know that at least two people were wounded, probably as a result of the warning shots, but we need to investigate the exact causes further.' Police said that riot police later launched charges at the demonstrators, adding: 'The water launcher has been deployed.' The situation had largely calmed late on Friday but the smoking wreckage of a burned-out police car and dozens of smashed bicycles littered the scene, an AFP reporter said. Police tweeted that rioters started fires and threw fireworks during the rioting and authorities closed the city's main railway station and officers lined up on the streets of Rotterdam Pictured: A scooter is seen set ablaze in Rotterdam on Friday night as people too to the streets against Covid restrictions A scooter in Rotterdam city centre that was burnt out during anti-lockdown riots on Friday night after thousands of people took to the streets over the government's 2G policy that restricts unvaccinated people from certain venues Hundreds of people gather during a protest against the 2G (Covid-pass) policy in Coolsingel, Rotterdam, Netherlands, 19 November 2021 Demonstrators take part in a protest against a partial coronavirus lockdown and against the government policy on Coolsingel street on November 19, 2021 in the port city of Rotterdam Left: A grab from footage that appeared to show a person being shot in Rotterdam on Friday night (circled).

Professor John Edmund said today that opposition to stringent restrictions on the continent have demonstrated the importance of booster jabs, warning, 'it is pretty clear immunity does wane'. 'What you see now in central Europe with these rapid increase in cases, you see the importance of vaccination,' Mr Edmund told Sky. But Mr Edmund said the UK was unlikely to be hit by the Christmas chaos because the country 'is in a slightly different position.' He added: 'Frankly here in the UK, we've had high rates of infection for many months now so we're in a slightly different position to Austria and Germany and so on. 'I don't think things will quite happen in the same way here as they have done there. But it is a warning to us. I think it's pretty clear that immunity does wane. 'I'm sure you do still have some protection from the vaccine but it's nowhere near as strong as shortly after you've been vaccinated. It's very clear the booster doses do give a very clear boost to your immune system.' Asked whether the Government should re-introduce control measures, Mr Edmund told Sky: 'The plan B measures, we could've implemented them at any point. It's a government decision whether to take that step. 'They have to look at the potential effectiveness and measure that against the potential cost of some of those things.' Advertisement Riot police carrying shields and batons were directing groups of people away from the area. Officers on horseback and in police vans patrolled the streets. Police also cordoned off several scenes to comb for evidence, with a human finger visible on the ground at one of them, the AFP correspondent said. 'Most of the demonstrators are now gone. There only remain a few groups in a few places,' police spokesman Jesse Brobbel told AFP. Dutch justice minister Ferd Grapperhaus said in a statement that the 'extreme violence' against police and fire fighters in Rotterdam was 'repulsive'. 'The right to protest is very important in our society but what we saw last night was simply criminal behaviour,' Grapperhaus said. Dutch police said units from around the country were brought in to 'restore order' to Rotterdam. 'Dozens of arrests have now been made, it is expected that more arrests will follow. Around seven people have been injured, including on the side of the police,' a police statement said. At least one police car was set on fire during the protest, a police spokesman confirmed to AFP. The spokesperson could not confirm the number of people injured. Several electric scooters and other items were also torched, with several hundred protesters involved in the riots, images on Dutch media and social media showed. Local authorities issued an emergency order banning people from gathering in the area in a bid to prevent further violence, and the authorities also called on bystanders and people who recorded images of the riots to send the footage to police for further investigation. Police tweeted that rioters started fires and threw fireworks during the rioting and authorities closed the city's main railway station. The several hundred people had gathered to voice opposition to government plans to restrict access to indoor venues to people who have a 'corona pass' showing they have been vaccinated or already recovered from an infection. The pass is also available to people who have not been vaccinated, but have proof of a negative test. 'This is a very serious situation which requires action with the highest priority,' said the emergency order by the Rotterdam municipality. 'It is therefore necessary to issue this emergency order so as to maintain public order and to protect the safety of persons.'

It announced that the daily tally jumped to 22,936 on Friday, almost 500 more than the previous record set on Tuesday. The country's infection rate has risen to 929 new cases per 100,000 residents over the past seven days. In a worrying sign, 110 people died on Thursday, the ministry said, with the daily death toll surpassing 100 for the first time since April. The government has approved new restrictions to tackle the surge, targeting the unvaccinated in an effort to increase a vaccination rate that is below the European Union average. Starting on Monday, most unvaccinated people will no longer be allowed to show negative coronavirus tests in order to attend public events, go to bars and restaurants, visit hairdressers, museums and similar facilities or use hotels. Only people who are vaccinated or have recovered from Covid-19 will remain eligible. Overall, the nation of 10.7 million has registered almost two million cases with 32,005 deaths. Advertisement Local political party Leefbaar Rotterdam condemned the violence in a tweet. 'The centre of our beautiful city has this evening transformed into a war zone,' it said. 'Rotterdam is a city where you can disagree with things that happen but violence is never, never, the solution.' Like much of the rest of Europe, the Netherlands has seen Covid cases soar to record levels in recent days, with more than 21,000 new infections reported on Friday. The latest restrictions were announced on November 12, and sparked clashes between demonstrators and police outside the justice ministry in The Hague. The restrictions came into force the following day, shuttering bars, restaurants, cafes and supermarkets at 8:00 pm daily, while non-essential shops must shut at 6:00 pm. People are limited to having four visitors at home and have been advised to work at home unless absolutely necessary. Public events have been scrapped while football matches must be played behind closed doors. Schools however remain open, and people are allowed to leave their homes without restrictions. The Dutch government has said it will review the situation on December 3. It is considering excluding the unvaccinated from bars and restaurants, limiting admittance to people who have been vaccinated or who have recovered from the disease, but there was significant opposition to the plan during a debate in parliament this week. The Netherlands suffered its worst riots in four decades in January after a night-time Covid curfew, the country's first since World War II, came into force. Earlier Friday, the government banned fireworks on Dec. 31 for the second straight year. The ban is intended 'to prevent, as much as possible, extra strain on health care, law enforcement and first responders,' the government said Friday. The riots in Rotterdam come after Austria said on Friday that it will become the first country in western Europe to reimpose a full Covid-19 lockdown, while neighbouring Germany warned it may follow suit, sending shivers through financial markets worried about the economic fallout. Restrictions have also been placed on the unvaccinated in Germany – where they have been banned from restaurants – as well as in the Czech Republic and Slovakia.

'The situation is very, very serious and difficult,' Markus Soeder, premier of the southern state of Bavaria, said as he also announced a shutdown of clubs, bars and night service at restaurants. The eastern state of Saxony unveiled similar measures and went even further by closing all sporting and cultural venues, banning tourism, public consumption of alcohol and barring the unvaccinated from non-essential shops and hairdressers. Saxony premier Michael Kretschmer - whose state has Germany's lowest vaccination rate at just under 60 percent of the population - admitted that many of the restrictions would affect the vaccinated as well. But he said tough action was needed to keep hospitals from being overwhelmed and called for 'solidarity' from all citizens. 'We need more 'we' and less 'I' in this pandemic,' he told reporters. Bavaria and Saxony are among the hardest hit regions in the ferocious fourth Covid wave sweeping Germany. Reporting by AFP Advertisement Following the announcement, Freedom Party leader Herbert Kickl posted a picture on Facebook with the inscription: 'As of today Austria is a dictatorship.' The party is planning a protest on Saturday, but Kickl cannot attend because he has tested positive for Covid-19 and must self-isolate for 14 days. Europe has again become the epicentre of the pandemic, accounting for half of global cases and deaths, the WHO said. A fourth wave of infections has plunged Germany, Europe's largest economy, into a national emergency, Health Minister Jens Spahn said, warning that vaccinations alone will not cut case numbers. Both decisions infuriated many in a country where scepticism about state mandates affecting individual freedoms runs high, encouraged by the far-right Freedom Party, the third biggest in parliament. Asked if Germany could rule out an Austrian-style full lockdown, Spahn said: 'We are now in a situation - even if this produces a news alert - where we can't rule anything out. 'We are in a national emergency,' he told a news conference. Looming lockdowns weighed on a range of financial market sectors on Friday, pushing stocks and oil down and boosting the dollar. 'We expect targeted measures (against COVID-19) across some countries mainly according to the health situation, but other factors, such as domestic political situations, will be relevant,' Oxford Economics analysts said in a note. 'And while it might take a while before a political consensus can be reached in other countries, it is clear that the tide has turned.' As cases rise again, a number of European governments have started to reimpose limits on activity, ranging from Austria's full lockdown to a partial lockdown in the Netherlands and restrictions on the unvaccinated in parts of Germany, the Czech Republic and Slovakia. Niels Van Regenmortel, the intensive care units coordinator at the ZNA Stuivenberg hospital in Antwerp, said there was an increasing risk hospitals in Belgium will have to resort to triage as ICUs fill up amid soaring COVID-19 numbers, calling on the government to restrict night life.

It reveals that Sweden is in the bottom half of countries for vaccine uptake, but ahead of nations including the UK and Germany Europe has become the epicentre of the pandemic once again, with the World Health Organisation warning that the Continent was the only region in the world where deaths had increased - with Covid-related fatalities spiking by five per cent just this week What Covid restrictions are in place in Sweden? The country- which dodged a lockdown unlike most other nations - also has next to no Covid restrictions in place. It dropped its final measures recommending people to work from home where possible on September 29. And advice for people to wear face masks on public transport was abandoned on July. Unlike in other countries the coverings were never compulsory. On November 11 Swedish health authorities went even further telling double-vaccinated people they no longer needed to swab themselves for the virus. But this move has now been reversed after critics said it left the country in a dangerous position just before winter. Some travel restrictions are still in place for people coming to the country from non-EU nations and Britain. All arrivals are required to show a certificate they have been double-vaccinated. When this is not possible they are asked to show a negative Covid test result from to come to the country from non-EU countries. All arrivals are also required to prove they up to 48 hours before they travelled. Sweden will impose further restrictions from December 1 requiring everyone attending events of more than 100 people to show proof they are double-vaccinated. Officials have warned more Covid restrictions may be needed this winter. Advertisement Whether or not countries opt to lock down again depends on a wide range of factors, including vaccination rates, mask mandates and the extent to which booster shots are being made available. Germany has said further measures will be decided based on when hospitalisation rates hit certain thresholds, while Friday saw its first states - Saxony and Bavaria - cancel all their Christmas markets. The Bavarian state capital of Munich on Tuesday had become the first major German city to cancel its Christmas market for the second year in a row. Saxony's cancellations means the famed Dresden Christmas market is also scrapped. Germany hosts some 2,500 Christmas markets each year, cherished by visitors who come to savour mulled wine and roasted chestnuts, and shop for seasonal trinkets among clusters of wooden chalets. In pre-pandemic times, they drew about 160 million domestic and international visitors annually who brought in revenues of three to five billion euros ($3.4 billion to $5.6 billion), according to the BSM stallkeepers' industry association. In France, President Emmanuel Macron has made it clear he thinks high levels of vaccinations should be enough to avoid future lockdowns. Britain, with higher numbers of infections than most countries in Europe, is rolling out third shots - or boosters - to offset waning protection from the first two and help keep the economy open. While the new measures across Europe are not seen hitting the economy as much as the all-out lockdowns of last year, analysts say they could weigh on the recovery in the last quarter, especially if they hurt the retail and hospitality sectors over Christmas. A full lockdown in Germany would be more serious, however. 'With Germany ... imposing new restrictions, any thoughts that the vaccines would offer a way to a more normal Christmas period appear to have gone up in smoke for now, in Europe at least,' said Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK. 'Although there is a nagging fear this could ripple out across the region.' The pressure on intensive care units in Germany has not yet reached its peak, Spahn said, urging people to reduce contacts to help break the wave. 'How Christmas will turn out, I dare not say. I can only say it's up to us,' he added.

A couple hug and laugh as they have lunch in a restaurant in Stockholm, Sweden EU issues advice on using Covid-19 pill for adults The European Union's drug regulator has issued advice on using Merck's COVID-19 pill for adults and began a review of a rival tablet from Pfizer to help member states decide on quick adoption ahead of any formal EU-wide approval. In two separate statements on Friday, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) detailed efforts to advance use of the experimental but promising options, as infections and COVID-related deaths are rapidly rising in the region and forcing renewed lockdowns. Merck's COVID-19 tablet, Lagevrio, developed with Ridgeback Biotherapeutics, should be given early and within five days of first symptoms to treat adults who do not need oxygen support and are at risk of their disease worsening. It advised against treatment during pregnancy and for women who plan to or could get pregnant, while adding that breastfeeding must also be stopped around the time of using the pill, which is to be taken twice a day for five days. Drugs in the same class as Merck's Lagevrio have been linked to birth defects in animal studies. The drugmaker, known as MSD outside the United States and Canada, has said animal testing shows its pill is safe, but the data have not been made public. EMA said it was studying available data on the Pfizer pill Paxlovid, days after the drugmaker sought U.S. approval, adding that a more comprehensive rolling review was expected to start ahead of any approval. It did not specify when that review would be. The EMA last month began a rolling review of the Merck pill and expects to conclude that evaluation by the end of the year. Advertisement Chancellor Angela Merkel said on Thursday Germany will limit large parts of public life in areas where hospitals are becoming dangerously full of COVID-19 patients to those who have either been vaccinated or have recovered from the illness. 'It's clear from our experience in England and from what's happening across Europe that while vaccines do a lot of the heavy lifting ... other interventions are required to prevent case numbers rising,' said Lawrence Young, virologist and professor of molecular oncology at the University of Warwick. 'Less mask wearing, more mixing indoors due to colder weather and waning immunity are also contributing to the high case levels across Europe.' Sweden, meanwhile, has the lowest Covid infection rate in western Europe — after double-vaccinated nationals were told they don't have to test for the virus even if they get symptoms. The Scandinavian nation — which was subject to international scrutiny last year when it refused to lockdown — is currently recording 85.4 cases per million people, according to Oxford University research site Our World in Data. By comparison, the rate is nearly 1,400 per million in Europe's current Covid capital Austria, which today announced it is going back into a full lockdown from Monday. Sweden's infection rate is far lower than other Western European countries like the Netherlands (1,048.7), Britain (581), Germany (536), and France (201). And for the first time in the pandemic, Sweden is recording fewer cases per population size than its Scandinavian neighbours Denmark (655), Norway (351) and Finland (150). But critics say Sweden has been left 'in the dark' over the true extent of its coronavirus wave because the double-vaccinated, equivalent to almost seven in ten people, are not being routinely swabbed. Last week, Sweden broke ranks with its European neighbours once again and told Swedes they did not have to get tested if they were fully jabbed, even if they had symptoms. Covid swabbing rates plunged 35 per cent last week, compared to a month earlier. But this week the policy was reversed in response to rising cases on the continent. A fresh wave of Delta is rolling across the continent and putting pressure on hospitals once again, which has forced most in the EU to bring back some form of curbs. Latest figures show Sweden is only carrying out 1.26 tests per 1,000 people, which is also the lowest number in western Europe. The threat of fresh lockdowns comes as optimism grows about experimental drugs developed by Pfizer and Merck that cut the chance of hospitalisation and severe illness, more weapons in the world's fight against the virus. On Friday, the EU drug regulator said it was reviewing data on Pfizer's COVID-19 pill to help member states decide on quick adoption ahead of any formal EU-wide approval. Slovakia has also seen a surge in infections, with 9,171 reported on Friday, its biggest daily tally since the pandemic began. The country of 5.5 million earlier in the week tightened restrictions on people who have not had COVID-19 shots. With a seven-day incidence of 11,500 new cases per million inhabitants, the country has the worst reported epidemic situation in the world, according to Our World in Data statistics."", ""Europe descended into a third day of violent carnage on Sunday as tens of thousands of people in Belgium took to the streets to protest against the return of strict lockdown rules aimed at curbing a rise in Covid infections. Nearly 40,000 people descended on the capital Brussels to protest against new anti-Covid measures banning the unvaccinated from entering restaurants and bars. Some protesters were seen throwing projectiles at riot police and in response, officers fired water cannon and tear gas at the group. Police have made some arrests, but it is not immediately clear how many. Video footage from Brussels shows a large group of protesters shouting at police as some light flares and throw them at the officers. One man can even be seen mooning at them. The protests descended into chaos, with some of the protesters seen setting fires on the streets while others threw rocks through the windows of local businesses including a post office. Two police cars have also been damaged. The protest came just hours after it emerged Germany is set to follow Austria's example in making vaccinations compulsory with ministers admitting that the move is 'unavoidable' amid a fourth wave of the pandemic which is crippling the country's hospitals. Last night also saw similar demonstrations against virus restrictions take place in Austria, Switzerland, Croatia, Italy, Northern Ireland, Austria and North Macedonia on Saturday, a day after Dutch police opened fire on protesters and seven people were injured in rioting that erupted in Rotterdam. Europe has become the epicentre of the pandemic once again, with the World Health Organisation warning that the Continent was the only region in the world where deaths had increased as Covid-related fatalities spiked by five per cent just this week. In France, the government has warned that the fifth wave of coronavirus are rising at 'lightning speed', with new daily Covid cases close to doubling over the past week. In Belgium, cases have been surging, with infections reaching 13,836 on Sunday. In response, the government has introduced restrictions including a ban on the unvaccinated from venues such as restaurants and bars, and an order to work from home at least four days a week. Police said 35,000 protesters marched from the North Station in Brussels on Sunday afternoon against a fresh round of Covid measures announced by the government on Wednesday. The demonstration, called 'Together for Freedom', saw some protesters clash with riot police near the Belgian capital's EU and government district. Many of the protesters caught up in the clash were wearing hoods and carried Flemish nationalist flags. A total of 42 people were detained and two were arrested in the riots. Meanwhile, three police officers were injured and taken to hospital and one protester was hurt after a firework exploded in his hand.

Several police officers were injured after protesters threw bottles and fireworks at them. Last week, Belgium's Prime Minister Last week, Belgium's Prime Minister Alexander De Croo said 'the alarm signals are all red' as he imposed tough restrictions, ordering people to work at home for at least four days a week. Under new restrictions, all people in indoor venues such as cafes and restaurants will need to wear a mask unless seated and the rule will apply to those aged 10 or older. The previous age threshold was 12. Nightclubs may have to test their guests if they want to let them dance mask-free. People wanting to eat in a restaurant or go to the theatre already must present a COVID pass, showing vaccination, a negative test or recent recovery. Most Belgians will also have to work from home four days a week until mid-December, and for three days after that. Belgium has one of the highest cases per capita rates in the European Union, behind only the Baltic and former Yugoslav nations and Austria, at around one per hundred people over the past 14 days, according to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control. 'The alarm signals are all red,' prime minister Alexander De Croo told a news conference. 'We had all hoped to have a winter without coronavirus, but Belgium is not an island.' Niels Van Regenmortel, the intensive care units coordinator at the ZNA Stuivenberg hospital in Antwerp, said there was an increasing risk hospitals in Belgium will have to resort to triage as ICUs fill up amid soaring COVID-19 numbers, calling on the government to restrict night life. In Germany, the number of Covid cases are soaring daily, with the country reporting 48,201 infections on Saturday - the highest number of new coronavirus cases since the beginning of the pandemic. The fourth wave is overwhelming hospitals, with health chiefs warning that the situation is 'extremely critical' across the country. In France, fifth-wave coronavirus infections are rising at an alarming rate, the government reported Sunday, with new daily Covid cases close to doubling over the past week. In Germany, a relatively low vaccination rate - hovering under 70 per cent - has left the country vulnerable to the virus. Germany's federal tourism commissioner Thomas Bareiß has now said the worsening situation makes it clear that compulsory vaccination is 'unavoidable'. Bareiß told DPA news agency: 'In retrospect, it was wrong not to see that right from the start. The hope at that time is understandable, but it was not realistic.' His calls were echoed by the Prime Minister of Bavaria, which has seen Covid cases surge, who said 'in the end we will not be able to avoid compulsory vaccination'. The above graph shows the Covid infection rate per million people for western European countries from November last year.

Pictured: Protesters in Brussels on Sunday Riot police raise their shields as they clash with protesters on a bridge in Brussels on Sunday during anti-vaccine demonstrations Thousands of protesters, many of them peaceful, marched through the streets of Brussels on Sunday. Some held signs which read 'Stand up for your rights' and 'Stop the madness' Mr Bareiß, the tourism commissioner of Germany's federal government, said a compulsory vaccination is 'unavoidable'. Putin tells Russia he had Covid booster jab Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Sunday he had taken a third dose of a Covid vaccine, as the country struggled with a fresh wave of the virus. 'I had it two hours ago,' Putin said on state television channel Rossiya 24, assuring viewers that his booster injection of the Sputnik vaccine had been painless. The authorities are struggling to convince people to get vaccinated against Covid, even as a fresh wave of the virus is killing record numbers every day. Even though Russia has several vaccines that it has manufactured itself, only 36.7 percent of the population is fully vaccinated, according to the Gogov website, which tracks the data. Putin, who said he opposes universal mandatory vaccination, has backed measures taken in some regions for certain people. For example, in June, authorities in Moscow said vaccination would be obligatory for anyone working in the service sector. Russia recorded more than 9.3 million cases of Covid and just over 264,000 deaths, which makes it the worst-hit country in Europe. The actual toll from the pandemic there was closer to 450,000 at the end of September, according to figures from the Rosstat statistics agency however, which works with a broader definition of Covid-linked deaths. Advertisement He said: 'For me it is politically no longer justifiable that entire industries, retailers, restaurants, clubs, bars and the entire cinema, cultural and event scene live in a state of crisis prescribed by the state for 20 months and are faced with great existential fears, while others are concerned take the freedom not to vaccinate. 'So far, historical measures and sums of money have been able to save many companies. That doesn't work in the long run.' In Bavaria, there has been a 'dramatic' coronavirus resurgence. It prompted the Bavarian state capital of Munich to become the first major German city to cancel its Christmas market, which usually draws some three million visitors. The Bavarian Prime Minister Markus Söder said he believes the country will 'not be able to avoid' compulsory vaccination. He told Berliner Zeitung: 'I believe that in the end we will not be able to avoid compulsory vaccination. Otherwise it will be an endless loop with this coronavirus.' The director of Frankfurt University Hospital said the situation in intensive care units in the state of Hesse is 'critical'. Jürgen Graf, who is also the head of the planning staff for the inpatient care of Covid patients in Hesse at the Ministry of Health, told Bild: 'The situation is extremely critical. What we are currently doing is crisis management.' He added: 'This is not a problem for Covid patients, it affects everyone,' explaining that inpatient care and the care of emergency patients are 'impaired' due to longer wait times. The warning comes as a hospital in Bavaria's Freising last week made the unprecedented decision to transfer a Covid-19 patient to northern Italy because it 'had no more capacity to receive them, and the surrounding hospitals were also full.' Almost one per cent of the new infections end up in the intensive care unit, Graf said. 'Given the current number of infections, that would be 50 or more patients per week in addition to the approximately 250 patients treated there today,' he added. 'Then in a few weeks we will be well above last winter's high.' The fourth wave is overwhelming hospitals, with health chiefs warning that the situation is 'extremely critical' across the country. Pictured: Doctors and nurses tend to a patient on the Covid-19 intensive care unit at University Hospital Leipzig on November 18 THE NETHERLANDS: A day after Rotterdam rioting that saw seven people injured, thousands more took to Amsterdam's central Dam Square and The Hague (pictured above), with seven arrests being made according to police AUSTRIA: Protesters carrying a banner reading 'Control the border. Not your people' at the anti-lockdown demonstration held by the far-right Freedom Party in Vienna today The fourth wave of infections has plunged Germany, Europe's largest economy, into a national emergency, Health Minister Jens Spahn said. He urged people to reduce their social contacts, warning that vaccinations alone would not reduce case numbers. Asked if Germany could rule out an Austrian-style full lockdown, Spahn said: 'We are now in a situation - even if this produces a news alert - where we can't rule anything out. 'We are in a national emergency,' he told a news conference. Their comments come after the upper house of parliament on Friday approved new measures to control the outbreak proposed by the centre-left alliance that emerged after the September 26 national election. Three people treated in hospital and inquiry launched after Dutch police fired warning shots during Rotterdam riots Three people were being treated in hospital in Rotterdam on Saturday after they were seriously injured when Dutch police fired shots during a violent protest against COVID-19 measures, authorities said. Crowds of several hundred rioters torched cars, set off fireworks and threw rocks at police during the protests on Friday evening. Police responded with warning shots and water canons. Rotterdam police posted on Twitter on Saturday that 51 people had been arrested, half of whom were under 18. 'Three rioters were wounded when they were hit by bullets, they remain in hospital,' police added, in an update after earlier reporting two wounded. Authorities are investigating the shootings including whether the wounded people where hit by police bullets, they added. The city's mayor, Ahmed Aboutaleb, said the protest had turned into 'an orgy of violence.' 'Police were forced to draw their weapons and even fire direct shots,' he told a news conference early on Saturday. Dutch Justice Minister Ferd Grapperhaus said in a statement the 'extreme violence' against police and firefighters in Rotterdam was 'repulsive.' 'The right to protest is very important in our society but what we saw last night was simply criminal behaviour,' Grapperhaus said. Protesters had gathered to voice opposition to government plans to restrict access to indoor venues to people who have a 'corona pass,' showing they have been vaccinated or have already recovered from an infection. The pass is also available to people who have not been vaccinated, but have proof of a negative test. Advertisement The measures include requirements for people to prove they are vaccinated, recently recovered from Covid-19 or have tested negative for the virus in order to access communal workplaces or public transport. Separately, outgoing Chancellor Angela Merkel agreed with the governors of Germany's 16 states to introduce a new threshold linked to the number of hospital admissions of Covid-19 patients per 100,000 people over a seven-day period. The new three-tier system would require people to show evidence of a vaccination or previous infection to enter public buildings or businesses in states where hospitalisation rates go above 3 in 100,000 people, based on a seven-day average. At present, that will affect 9 of Germany's 16 states. In France, the seven-day average of new cases reached 17,153 on Saturday, up from 9,458 a week earlier, according to the health authorities, an increase of 81 percent. 'The fifth wave is starting at lightning speed,' government spokesman Gabrial Attal said. The latest seven-day increase is three times the average rise of cases recorded over the previous three weeks, indicating an exponential acceleration of infections. For now the spike in infections has not led to a massive influx of Covid patients into hospitals, with the authorities attributing the limited number of intensive care patients to France's high rate of vaccinations which appear highly effective against the most dangerous forms of Covid. On Saturday, hospitals reported a total of 7,974 Covid patients in their care, with 1,333 of them in intensive treatment. This compares to 6,500 and 1,000, respectively, a month earlier. 'There is a very strong increase in infections, but we also know that in France we have a very large vaccination cover,' he said. 'We seem to be ahead of our neighbours concerning booster shots.' France's introduction of a health pass ahead of other countries in the summer was also helping to keep Covid in check, he said. The health pass, required in French restaurants, cafes and many cultural venues, certifies that a person is fully vaccinated, has recently recovered from Covid, or has tested negative for the virus. The government continues to stand by its choice to 'bring the weight of restrictions to bear on non-vaccinated people rather than vaccinated people', Attal said Last night, Europe descended into a second night of violent carnage amid the return of strict lockdown rules aimed at curbing rising rates of Covid infection. Thousands of people took to Amsterdam's central Dam Square and the Hague on Saturday, a day after the 'orgy of violence' during the Rotterdam riots that saw seven people injured. Police said seven arrests were made on Sunday after youths set streets ablaze and shot fireworks at officers. Video footage from the Hague showed motorists sounding their horns in support as a trio of small explosions could be clearly seen on the main road in the background. Elsewhere, protesters were pictured ripping down street signs in chaotic scenes. Anti-riot police were forced to clear the wreckage of smouldering scooters and burnt-out bicycles that were torched by the anti-vax mob and left to block roads in one of the worst outbreaks of violence in the country since Covid restrictions were first implemented. Meanwhile, similar demonstrations against virus restrictions also took place in Switzerland, Croatia, Italy, Northern Ireland, Austria and North Macedonia on Saturday, a day after Dutch police opened fire on protesters and seven people were injured in rioting that erupted in Rotterdam. It comes as violence broke out in Vienna on Saturday as 10,000 protesters - many from far-right groups - took to the streets to demonstrate against new Covid-19 restrictions and mandatory vaccinations. Police were pictured arresting two protesters. A spokesman said there had been fewer than 10 arrests, for breaches of coronavirus restrictions and the ban on Nazi symbols. Some protesters mockingly wore doctor's scrubs, while others wore the yellow stars as badges in reference to Nazi Germany's policy of forcing Jews to wear the badge as identification. Chanting 'resistance!', waving Austrian flags and blowing whistles, the crowd swelled to more than 30,000. Many held signs mocking government leaders including Chancellor Alexander Schallenberg and Health Minister Wolfgang Mueckstein. Protesters rallied against coronavirus restrictions and mandatory COVID-19 passes needed in many European countries to enter restaurants, Christmas markets or sports events, as well as mandatory vaccinations. The Austrian protest, which was promoted by the far-right opposition Freedom Party, became violent and five police officers were injured - a development which Austria's Interior Minister Karl Nehammer slammed as 'unacceptable'. Nehammer told a press conference on Sunday morning: 'If at a meeting that is organised and promoted by a parliamentary party, where police officers are attacked and Nazi crimes are played down by wearing the Jewish star, that is unacceptable.' The protesters had worn the yellow Jewish star as badges, with the words 'unvaccinated' stitched on, as they compared the lockdown and mandatory vaccination measures with the atrocities of the Nazi era. Nehammer said: 'This is not only completely tasteless, it plays down the crimes of the National Socialists and offends the millions of victims of the Nazi dictatorship and their families.' The interior minister said some of the protesters were from right-wing extremist groups, with some setting fire to a police car and confessing that they 'wanted to burn a police officer'. 'This is an extent of radicalisation that is by no means acceptable,' Nehammer said, adding that the police officers 'professionally ensured security in a difficult mission'. AUSTRIA: Thousands of residents - one holding a sign reading 'no to mandatory vaccination' - today gathered in Vienna to demonstrate against new Covid restrictions amid soaring infection rates across the continent In Italy, 3,000 turned out in the capital's Circus Maximus, a field where in ancient times Romans staged popular entertainment, to protest against 'Green Pass' certificates required at workplaces, restaurants, cinemas, theaters, sports venues and gyms, as well as for long-distance train, bus or ferry travel within Italy. In Northern Ireland, several hundred people opposed to vaccine passports protested outside the city hall in Belfast, where the city's Christmas market opened Saturday - a market where proof of vaccination or a negative COVID-19 test was required. The Northern Ireland government voted this week to introduce vaccine certificates for admission to nightclubs, bars and restaurants starting Dec. 13. 'People like us never give up,' read one banner, in the red, white and green colors of the Italian flag. Virtually no one at the Rome protest wore a protective mask. Switzerland saw 2,000 people protest an upcoming referendum on whether to approve the government's COVID-19 restrictions law, claiming it was discriminatory, public broadcaster SRF reported. In Croatia, thousands gathered at in the capital Zagreb, carrying Croatian flags, nationalist and religious symbols, along with banners against vaccination and what they describe as restrictions of people's freedoms. And in Denmark, more than one thousand gathered outside the Danish parliament in Copenhagen to push back against the reintroduction of the national health pass. North Macedonia also saw hundreds of anti-vaccination protesters march in downtown Skopje on Satruday evening against the country's health authority's recommendation of mandatory vaccinations. Demonstrations against virus measures are also expected in other European countries - the latest in rising anger at the re-introduction of restrictions amid soaring cases on the continent. This comes as the World Health Organization (WHO) said it was 'very worried' about the spread of Covid-19 within Europe as the continent battles a fresh wave of infections. Regional director Dr Hans Kluge told the BBC that some 500,000 more deaths could be recorded by March unless urgent action is taken.

The island's prefect on Friday introduced the night-time stay-at-home order after protests against the coronavirus vaccine pass spiralled into violence the previous night. But the measure did little to quell the rioting. 'The night was very turbulent,' a police source said. The security forces recorded 'some 20 incidents of looting or attempted robbery' in the seaside towns of Pointe-a-Pitre and Le Gosier, including at a jewellery shop, a bank, a betting shop and a shopping centre. In the town of Saint-Francois to the east, 'gendarmes coming out of the station were threatened by blazing projectiles'. A second source within the gendarmerie said an armoury had been looted. The first source said 'firearms were used against police forces in four different areas' across the island, and one member was slightly wounded after a stone hit him in the face. In the area of Le Petit-Bourg to the west, firemen had to put out fires in two mobile phone stores, which had also been plundered. The interior ministry said 31 people had been arrested. France late Saturday said it was sending around 50 personnel from both its RAID elite police force and its GIGN counter-terrorism unit to Guadeloupe. The doctors' union in Guadeloupe warned against further trouble while the health system was so 'fragile'. They criticised 'individuals who may have prevented patients from getting access to treatment, or medical staff from reaching their place of practice'. While most people in mainland France have now received two vaccination doses, rates in its overseas territories have lagged behind. By November 16, some 46 percent of adults in Guadeloupe had received at least one jab of a vaccine against Covid. Advertisement Five police officers were injured during rioting at the Hague, with one taken to hospital suffering concussion and two suffering hearing damage from loud fireworks,. A rock thrown by rioters also smashed the window of a passing ambulance carrying a patient, the city's police force said. Elsewhere in the Netherlands, two football matches in the Eredivise, the top professional league, were briefly halted after fans - banned from matches under a partial lockdown in force in the Netherlands for a week - broke into stadiums in the towns of Alkmaar and Almelo. Earlier Saturday, two protests against COVID-19 measures went off peacefully in Amsterdam and the southern city of Breda. Police said in a tweet that seven people were arrested in The Hague and five officers were injured. One needed treatment in a hospital. Local media reported that rioters threw bicycles, wooden pallets and motorized scooters on one of the fires. The chaos in The Hague was on a smaller scale than the pitched battles on the streets of Rotterdam on Friday night, when police said that three rioters were hit by bullets and investigations were underway to establish if they were shot by police. Officers in Rotterdam arrested 51 people, about half of them minors, police said Saturday afternoon. One police officer was hospitalized with a leg injury sustained in the rioting, another was treated by ambulance staff and 'countless' others suffered minor injuries. Mayor Ahmed Aboutaleb told reporters in the early hours of Saturday morning that 'on a number of occasions the police felt it necessary to draw their weapons to defend themselves' as rioters rampaged through the port city's central shopping district, setting fires and throwing rocks and fireworks at officers. 'They shot at protesters, people were injured,' Aboutaleb said. He did not have details on the injuries. Police also fired warning shots. Justice Minister Ferd Grapperhaus condemned the events. 'The riots and extreme violence against police officers, riot police and firefighters last night in Rotterdam are disgusting to see,' he said in a statement. 'Protesting is a great right in our society, but what we saw last night is simply criminal behavior. It has nothing to do with demonstrating,' he added. An independent investigation into the shootings by police was opened, as is the case whenever Dutch police use their weapons. As the march kicked off on Vienna's Heldenplatz, thousands of protesters gathered on the massive square. About 1,300 police officers were on duty. They used loudspeakers to tell protesters masks were required, but most did not wear them. Chanting 'resistance!' and blowing whistles, protesters began to move slowly down the city's inner ring road. Many waved Austrian flags and carried signs mocking government leaders like Chancellor Alexander Schallenberg and Health Minister Wolfgang Mueckstein. Some wore doctor's scrubs; others donned tinfoil hats. Most of the signs focused on the newly announced vaccine mandate: 'My Body, My Choice,' read one. 'We're Standing Up for Our Kids!' said another. By mid-afternoon the crowds had swelled to roughly 35,000 people, according to the police, and were marching down Vienna's inner ring road before heading back towards the Hofburg. Police were pictured arresting two protesters. A spokesman said there had been fewer than 10 arrests, for breaches of coronavirus restrictions and the ban on Nazi symbols. Meanwhile, a few hundred protesters gathered in Amsterdam today and a similar number marched through the southern city of Breda over the latest Covid-19 measures. Riots also erupted in the central 'Bible Belt' town of Urk and cities in southern Limburg province, while angry fans disrupted two football matches being played behind closed doors because of coronavirus rules, Dutch media said. It comes after violent riots last night in which 51 were arrested in Rotterdam after thousands of anti-lockdown protesters gathered on one of the city's main shopping streets. Dutch police fired water canons, 'warning shots' and bullets at protesters to disperse the crowd who had lit fires and set off fireworks. Police confirmed seven injuries, including officers, in the violence but did not say if live ammunition or rubber bullets were fired. The Netherlands re-imposed some lockdown measures last weekend for an initial three weeks in an effort to slow a resurgence of coronavirus contagion, but daily infections have remained at their highest levels since the start of the pandemic. The Dutch government has said it wants to introduce a law that would allow businesses to restrict the country's coronavirus pass system to only people who are fully vaccinated or have recovered from Covid-19 - that would exclude people who test negative. The violent scenes in Rotterdam mirrored much of the continent's reaction to similar schemes announced by Austria, Germany, the Czech Republic, and Slovakia - with Italy and Greece also reportedly considering moves to restrict the movements of unvaccinated people.

The lockdown, which comes into effect on Monday, constitutes the toughest restrictions introduced in Europe in recent weeks as Covid-19 cases surge continent-wide, fuelled by vaccine resistance. Austrians will not be allowed to leave home except to go to work, shop for essentials and exercise. The restrictions will initially last 20 days with an evaluation after 10 days, Chancellor Alexander Schallenberg said. Vaccination against Covid-19 in the Alpine nation will be mandatory from February 1 next year, Schallenberg said. So far, the Vatican alone in Europe has imposed a vaccination mandate. The World Health Organization continues to favour policies that 'demonstrate the benefit and safety of vaccines for the greatest possible acceptance of vaccines, rather than imposed mandatory vaccination,' spokeswoman Fadela Chaib told reporters in Geneva. Austria has already imposed movement restrictions on those not vaccinated or recently recovered from the virus, ordering them to stay at home since Monday, becoming the first EU country to do so. But infections have continued to rise. On Friday, a new record of more than 15,800 new cases was recorded in the EU member of nearly nine million people. Reporting by AFP Advertisement Austrians are protesting against a new national lockdown and mandatory vaccinations, which the government said yesterday would be rolled out on February 1. Vaccinations in Austria have plateaued at one of the lowest rates in Western Europe - under 66 per cent - and hospitals in heavily hit states have warned that their intensive care units are reaching capacity. Austrian Chancellor Alexander Schallenberg said yesterday the country would go in lockdown for 10 days. The shutdown will then reevaluated and could be extended for a further 10 days. Most stores will close, and cultural events will be canceled. People will be able to leave their homes only for certain specific reasons, including buying groceries, going to the doctor or exercising. Average daily deaths have tripled in recent weeks and its infections are among the highest in Europe, with a seven-day incidence of 991 per 100,000 people. 'We have not succeeded in convincing enough people to get vaccinated,' Chancellor Alexander Schallenberg told a news conference. 'It hurts that such measures still have to be taken.' Schallenberg also apologised to all vaccinated people on Friday night saying it was not fair they had to suffer under the renewed lockdown restrictions when they had done everything to help contain the virus. 'I'm sorry to take this drastic step,' he said on public broadcaster ORF. Despite the violence a day earlier, around 300 protesters marched through the southern Dutch town of Breda near the Belgian border on Saturday carrying banners with slogans such as 'No Lockdown'. Organisers said they opposed Prime Minister Mark Rutte's plans to exclude the unvaccinated from bars and restaurants. A group that had called an Amsterdam protest for Saturday, United We Stand Europe, said on Facebook it had cancelled the rally because 'last night, all hell broke loose in Rotterdam'.

Local news outlet NL Times reported that a journalist was attacked of the street, while local broadcaster Rijnmond said the reporter was beaten and his camera was destroyed. Local media also reported gangs of soccer hooligans were involved in the rioting. One eyewitness - a press photographer – told local media they saw shell casings 'everywhere on the floor'. Cops also said it was 'unclear how or by whom' two people were shot during the chaos. Video from social media on Dutch broadcaster NOS appeared to show the person being hit in Rotterdam, but there was no explanation on what happened. Officers arrested 51 protesters last night and were expected to detain several more after studying video footage from security cameras. Late on Friday night, police said downtown Rotterdam remained restive and there was still a heavy police presence on the streets. Mayor Ahmed Aboutaleb told reporters in the early hours of Saturday morning that 'on a number of occasions the police felt it necessary to draw their weapons to defend themselves' as rioters ran rampage through the port city's central shopping district, setting fires and throwing rocks and fireworks at officers. 'They shot at protesters, people were injured,' Aboutaleb said, adding that several officers were injured in the violence. Police spokesperson Patricia Wessels confirmed that police fired shots, though it was not immediately clear what type of rounds were fired. 'We fired warning shots and there were also direct shots fired because the situation was life-threatening,' she said. 'We know that at least two people were wounded, probably as a result of the warning shots, but we need to investigate the exact causes further.' Police said that riot police later launched charges at the demonstrators, adding: 'The water launcher has been deployed.' The situation had largely calmed late on Friday but the smoking wreckage of a burned-out police car and dozens of smashed bicycles littered the scene, an AFP reporter said. Police tweeted that rioters started fires and threw fireworks during the rioting and authorities closed the city's main railway station and officers lined up on the streets of Rotterdam Pictured: A scooter is seen set ablaze in Rotterdam on Friday night as people too to the streets against Covid restrictions A scooter in Rotterdam city centre that was burnt out during anti-lockdown riots on Friday night after thousands of people took to the streets over the government's 2G policy that restricts unvaccinated people from certain venues Hundreds of people gather during a protest against the 2G (Covid-pass) policy in Coolsingel, Rotterdam, Netherlands, 19 November 2021 Demonstrators take part in a protest against a partial coronavirus lockdown and against the government policy on Coolsingel street on November 19, 2021 in the port city of Rotterdam Left: A grab from footage that appeared to show a person being shot in Rotterdam on Friday night (circled).

Professor John Edmund said today that opposition to stringent restrictions on the continent have demonstrated the importance of booster jabs, warning, 'it is pretty clear immunity does wane'. 'What you see now in central Europe with these rapid increase in cases, you see the importance of vaccination,' Mr Edmund told Sky. But Mr Edmund said the UK was unlikely to be hit by the Christmas chaos because the country 'is in a slightly different position.' He added: 'Frankly here in the UK, we've had high rates of infection for many months now so we're in a slightly different position to Austria and Germany and so on. 'I don't think things will quite happen in the same way here as they have done there. But it is a warning to us. I think it's pretty clear that immunity does wane. 'I'm sure you do still have some protection from the vaccine but it's nowhere near as strong as shortly after you've been vaccinated. It's very clear the booster doses do give a very clear boost to your immune system.' Asked whether the Government should re-introduce control measures, Mr Edmund told Sky: 'The plan B measures, we could've implemented them at any point. It's a government decision whether to take that step. 'They have to look at the potential effectiveness and measure that against the potential cost of some of those things.' Advertisement Riot police carrying shields and batons were directing groups of people away from the area. Officers on horseback and in police vans patrolled the streets. Police also cordoned off several scenes to comb for evidence, with a human finger visible on the ground at one of them, the AFP correspondent said. 'Most of the demonstrators are now gone. There only remain a few groups in a few places,' police spokesman Jesse Brobbel told AFP. Dutch justice minister Ferd Grapperhaus said in a statement that the 'extreme violence' against police and fire fighters in Rotterdam was 'repulsive'. 'The right to protest is very important in our society but what we saw last night was simply criminal behaviour,' Grapperhaus said. Dutch police said units from around the country were brought in to 'restore order' to Rotterdam. 'Dozens of arrests have now been made, it is expected that more arrests will follow. Around seven people have been injured, including on the side of the police,' a police statement said. At least one police car was set on fire during the protest, a police spokesman confirmed to AFP. The spokesperson could not confirm the number of people injured. Several electric scooters and other items were also torched, with several hundred protesters involved in the riots, images on Dutch media and social media showed. Local authorities issued an emergency order banning people from gathering in the area in a bid to prevent further violence, and the authorities also called on bystanders and people who recorded images of the riots to send the footage to police for further investigation. Police tweeted that rioters started fires and threw fireworks during the rioting and authorities closed the city's main railway station. The several hundred people had gathered to voice opposition to government plans to restrict access to indoor venues to people who have a 'corona pass' showing they have been vaccinated or already recovered from an infection. The pass is also available to people who have not been vaccinated, but have proof of a negative test. 'This is a very serious situation which requires action with the highest priority,' said the emergency order by the Rotterdam municipality. 'It is therefore necessary to issue this emergency order so as to maintain public order and to protect the safety of persons.'

It announced that the daily tally jumped to 22,936 on Friday, almost 500 more than the previous record set on Tuesday. The country's infection rate has risen to 929 new cases per 100,000 residents over the past seven days. In a worrying sign, 110 people died on Thursday, the ministry said, with the daily death toll surpassing 100 for the first time since April. The government has approved new restrictions to tackle the surge, targeting the unvaccinated in an effort to increase a vaccination rate that is below the European Union average. Starting on Monday, most unvaccinated people will no longer be allowed to show negative coronavirus tests in order to attend public events, go to bars and restaurants, visit hairdressers, museums and similar facilities or use hotels. Only people who are vaccinated or have recovered from Covid-19 will remain eligible. Overall, the nation of 10.7 million has registered almost two million cases with 32,005 deaths. Advertisement Local political party Leefbaar Rotterdam condemned the violence in a tweet. 'The centre of our beautiful city has this evening transformed into a war zone,' it said. 'Rotterdam is a city where you can disagree with things that happen but violence is never, never, the solution.' Like much of the rest of Europe, the Netherlands has seen Covid cases soar to record levels in recent days, with more than 21,000 new infections reported on Friday. The latest restrictions were announced on November 12, and sparked clashes between demonstrators and police outside the justice ministry in The Hague. The restrictions came into force the following day, shuttering bars, restaurants, cafes and supermarkets at 8:00 pm daily, while non-essential shops must shut at 6:00 pm. People are limited to having four visitors at home and have been advised to work at home unless absolutely necessary. Public events have been scrapped while football matches must be played behind closed doors. Schools however remain open, and people are allowed to leave their homes without restrictions. The Dutch government has said it will review the situation on December 3. It is considering excluding the unvaccinated from bars and restaurants, limiting admittance to people who have been vaccinated or who have recovered from the disease, but there was significant opposition to the plan during a debate in parliament this week. The Netherlands suffered its worst riots in four decades in January after a night-time Covid curfew, the country's first since World War II, came into force. Earlier Friday, the government banned fireworks on Dec. 31 for the second straight year. The ban is intended 'to prevent, as much as possible, extra strain on health care, law enforcement and first responders,' the government said Friday. The riots in Rotterdam come after Austria said on Friday that it will become the first country in western Europe to reimpose a full Covid-19 lockdown, while neighbouring Germany warned it may follow suit, sending shivers through financial markets worried about the economic fallout. Restrictions have also been placed on the unvaccinated in Germany – where they have been banned from restaurants – as well as in the Czech Republic and Slovakia.

'The situation is very, very serious and difficult,' Markus Soeder, premier of the southern state of Bavaria, said as he also announced a shutdown of clubs, bars and night service at restaurants. The eastern state of Saxony unveiled similar measures and went even further by closing all sporting and cultural venues, banning tourism, public consumption of alcohol and barring the unvaccinated from non-essential shops and hairdressers. Saxony premier Michael Kretschmer - whose state has Germany's lowest vaccination rate at just under 60 percent of the population - admitted that many of the restrictions would affect the vaccinated as well. But he said tough action was needed to keep hospitals from being overwhelmed and called for 'solidarity' from all citizens. 'We need more 'we' and less 'I' in this pandemic,' he told reporters. Bavaria and Saxony are among the hardest hit regions in the ferocious fourth Covid wave sweeping Germany. Reporting by AFP Advertisement Following the announcement, Freedom Party leader Herbert Kickl posted a picture on Facebook with the inscription: 'As of today Austria is a dictatorship.' The party is planning a protest on Saturday, but Kickl cannot attend because he has tested positive for Covid-19 and must self-isolate for 14 days. Europe has again become the epicentre of the pandemic, accounting for half of global cases and deaths, the WHO said. A fourth wave of infections has plunged Germany, Europe's largest economy, into a national emergency, Health Minister Jens Spahn said, warning that vaccinations alone will not cut case numbers. Both decisions infuriated many in a country where scepticism about state mandates affecting individual freedoms runs high, encouraged by the far-right Freedom Party, the third biggest in parliament. Asked if Germany could rule out an Austrian-style full lockdown, Spahn said: 'We are now in a situation - even if this produces a news alert - where we can't rule anything out. 'We are in a national emergency,' he told a news conference. Looming lockdowns weighed on a range of financial market sectors on Friday, pushing stocks and oil down and boosting the dollar. 'We expect targeted measures (against COVID-19) across some countries mainly according to the health situation, but other factors, such as domestic political situations, will be relevant,' Oxford Economics analysts said in a note. 'And while it might take a while before a political consensus can be reached in other countries, it is clear that the tide has turned.' As cases rise again, a number of European governments have started to reimpose limits on activity, ranging from Austria's full lockdown to a partial lockdown in the Netherlands and restrictions on the unvaccinated in parts of Germany, the Czech Republic and Slovakia. Niels Van Regenmortel, the intensive care units coordinator at the ZNA Stuivenberg hospital in Antwerp, said there was an increasing risk hospitals in Belgium will have to resort to triage as ICUs fill up amid soaring COVID-19 numbers, calling on the government to restrict night life.

It reveals that Sweden is in the bottom half of countries for vaccine uptake, but ahead of nations including the UK and Germany Europe has become the epicentre of the pandemic once again, with the World Health Organisation warning that the Continent was the only region in the world where deaths had increased - with Covid-related fatalities spiking by five per cent just this week What Covid restrictions are in place in Sweden? The country- which dodged a lockdown unlike most other nations - also has next to no Covid restrictions in place. It dropped its final measures recommending people to work from home where possible on September 29. And advice for people to wear face masks on public transport was abandoned on July. Unlike in other countries the coverings were never compulsory. On November 11 Swedish health authorities went even further telling double-vaccinated people they no longer needed to swab themselves for the virus. But this move has now been reversed after critics said it left the country in a dangerous position just before winter. Some travel restrictions are still in place for people coming to the country from non-EU nations and Britain. All arrivals are required to show a certificate they have been double-vaccinated. When this is not possible they are asked to show a negative Covid test result from to come to the country from non-EU countries. All arrivals are also required to prove they up to 48 hours before they travelled. Sweden will impose further restrictions from December 1 requiring everyone attending events of more than 100 people to show proof they are double-vaccinated. Officials have warned more Covid restrictions may be needed this winter. Advertisement Whether or not countries opt to lock down again depends on a wide range of factors, including vaccination rates, mask mandates and the extent to which booster shots are being made available. Germany has said further measures will be decided based on when hospitalisation rates hit certain thresholds, while Friday saw its first states - Saxony and Bavaria - cancel all their Christmas markets. The Bavarian state capital of Munich on Tuesday had become the first major German city to cancel its Christmas market for the second year in a row. Saxony's cancellations means the famed Dresden Christmas market is also scrapped. Germany hosts some 2,500 Christmas markets each year, cherished by visitors who come to savour mulled wine and roasted chestnuts, and shop for seasonal trinkets among clusters of wooden chalets. In pre-pandemic times, they drew about 160 million domestic and international visitors annually who brought in revenues of three to five billion euros ($3.4 billion to $5.6 billion), according to the BSM stallkeepers' industry association. In France, President Emmanuel Macron has made it clear he thinks high levels of vaccinations should be enough to avoid future lockdowns. Britain, with higher numbers of infections than most countries in Europe, is rolling out third shots - or boosters - to offset waning protection from the first two and help keep the economy open. While the new measures across Europe are not seen hitting the economy as much as the all-out lockdowns of last year, analysts say they could weigh on the recovery in the last quarter, especially if they hurt the retail and hospitality sectors over Christmas. A full lockdown in Germany would be more serious, however. 'With Germany ... imposing new restrictions, any thoughts that the vaccines would offer a way to a more normal Christmas period appear to have gone up in smoke for now, in Europe at least,' said Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK. 'Although there is a nagging fear this could ripple out across the region.' The pressure on intensive care units in Germany has not yet reached its peak, Spahn said, urging people to reduce contacts to help break the wave. 'How Christmas will turn out, I dare not say. I can only say it's up to us,' he added.

A couple hug and laugh as they have lunch in a restaurant in Stockholm, Sweden EU issues advice on using Covid-19 pill for adults The European Union's drug regulator has issued advice on using Merck's COVID-19 pill for adults and began a review of a rival tablet from Pfizer to help member states decide on quick adoption ahead of any formal EU-wide approval. In two separate statements on Friday, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) detailed efforts to advance use of the experimental but promising options, as infections and COVID-related deaths are rapidly rising in the region and forcing renewed lockdowns. Merck's COVID-19 tablet, Lagevrio, developed with Ridgeback Biotherapeutics, should be given early and within five days of first symptoms to treat adults who do not need oxygen support and are at risk of their disease worsening. It advised against treatment during pregnancy and for women who plan to or could get pregnant, while adding that breastfeeding must also be stopped around the time of using the pill, which is to be taken twice a day for five days. Drugs in the same class as Merck's Lagevrio have been linked to birth defects in animal studies. The drugmaker, known as MSD outside the United States and Canada, has said animal testing shows its pill is safe, but the data have not been made public. EMA said it was studying available data on the Pfizer pill Paxlovid, days after the drugmaker sought U.S. approval, adding that a more comprehensive rolling review was expected to start ahead of any approval. It did not specify when that review would be. The EMA last month began a rolling review of the Merck pill and expects to conclude that evaluation by the end of the year. Advertisement Chancellor Angela Merkel said on Thursday Germany will limit large parts of public life in areas where hospitals are becoming dangerously full of COVID-19 patients to those who have either been vaccinated or have recovered from the illness. 'It's clear from our experience in England and from what's happening across Europe that while vaccines do a lot of the heavy lifting ... other interventions are required to prevent case numbers rising,' said Lawrence Young, virologist and professor of molecular oncology at the University of Warwick. 'Less mask wearing, more mixing indoors due to colder weather and waning immunity are also contributing to the high case levels across Europe.' Sweden, meanwhile, has the lowest Covid infection rate in western Europe — after double-vaccinated nationals were told they don't have to test for the virus even if they get symptoms. The Scandinavian nation — which was subject to international scrutiny last year when it refused to lockdown — is currently recording 85.4 cases per million people, according to Oxford University research site Our World in Data. By comparison, the rate is nearly 1,400 per million in Europe's current Covid capital Austria, which today announced it is going back into a full lockdown from Monday. Sweden's infection rate is far lower than other Western European countries like the Netherlands (1,048.7), Britain (581), Germany (536), and France (201). And for the first time in the pandemic, Sweden is recording fewer cases per population size than its Scandinavian neighbours Denmark (655), Norway (351) and Finland (150). But critics say Sweden has been left 'in the dark' over the true extent of its coronavirus wave because the double-vaccinated, equivalent to almost seven in ten people, are not being routinely swabbed. Last week, Sweden broke ranks with its European neighbours once again and told Swedes they did not have to get tested if they were fully jabbed, even if they had symptoms. Covid swabbing rates plunged 35 per cent last week, compared to a month earlier. But this week the policy was reversed in response to rising cases on the continent. A fresh wave of Delta is rolling across the continent and putting pressure on hospitals once again, which has forced most in the EU to bring back some form of curbs. Latest figures show Sweden is only carrying out 1.26 tests per 1,000 people, which is also the lowest number in western Europe. The threat of fresh lockdowns comes as optimism grows about experimental drugs developed by Pfizer and Merck that cut the chance of hospitalisation and severe illness, more weapons in the world's fight against the virus. On Friday, the EU drug regulator said it was reviewing data on Pfizer's COVID-19 pill to help member states decide on quick adoption ahead of any formal EU-wide approval. Slovakia has also seen a surge in infections, with 9,171 reported on Friday, its biggest daily tally since the pandemic began. The country of 5.5 million earlier in the week tightened restrictions on people who have not had COVID-19 shots. With a seven-day incidence of 11,500 new cases per million inhabitants, the country has the worst reported epidemic situation in the world, according to Our World in Data statistics.""]"

Alexei\'s wife was among nearly 3,500 people to have been detained by Russian police officers during protests in as many as 100 cities. After being arrested by officers Yulia, 44, posted a selfie onto her Instagram page with the caption: \'Apologies for the poor quality. Very bad light in the police van.\' According to reports from Russian media outlets, Yulia has now been released from police custody in Moscow. It comes after supporters of Putin critic Alexei Navalny continued to clash with police deep into the night as world leaders condemned officers\' \'brutal tactics\' which left crowds of activists bloodied and injured. The wife of Alexei Navalny, Yulia Navalnaya, 44, (pictured) was detained at an anti-government demonstration in Moscow while major anti-Kremlin demonstrations broke out across Russia on Saturday in support of the jailed Putin-critic. She uploaded a picture to Instagram from inside the police van she was placed in following her arrest. Russian media outlets report that she has now been released by police Riot police officers detain a participant in an unauthorized rally in support of Russian opposition activist Alexei Navalny by the Moscow Circus Russian policemen detain men during an unauthorized protest rally against the jailing of opposition leader Alexei Navalny Hundreds of thousands of anti-government protesters took part in demonstrations across 70 cities on Saturday in a show of defiance against the jailing of Navalny, who was poisoned with a nerve agent he says was slipped to him by state security agents in August. Demonstrators were dragged off by riot officers to police buses and detention trucks, while some activists were beaten with police batons. Authorities eventually pushed protesters out of Moscow\'s Pushkin Square, but thousands then regrouped along a wide boulevard about half a mile away, many of them throwing snowballs at the police before dispersing. The violent scenes from police drew condemnation from both the United States and the European Union, whose foreign policy chief said he deplored the \'widespread arrests\' and the \'disproportionate use of force\'. Similarly, the United States called on Russian authorities to release protesters and journalists detained, and condemned what it called \'harsh tactics\' used against them. Throughout the day and into the early hours of Sunday morning, people were seen holding signs that read \'Russia will be free\' and chanting \'Putin is a thief.\' Some then marched towards the Kremlin, while others blocked Tverskaya Street, the capital\'s main thoroughfare. Reuters reporters estimated at least 40,000 people had gathered in central Moscow for one of the biggest unauthorised rallies for years, but authorities claimed a mere 4,000 people had shown up. The foreign ministry questioned Reuters\' crowd estimate, using sarcasm to suggest it was too high. \'Why not just immediately say 4 million?,\' it quipped on its official Telegram messenger channel.

AFP journalists saw several protesters left badly injured after clashing with police in Moscow, which saw its largest gathering of anti-government protesters in two years Protesters clash with riot police during a rally in support of jailed opposition leader Alexei Navalny in downtown Moscow on January 23. The protests in Moscow were estimated to be the largest demonstrations since 2019 when Navalny supporters rallied to demand free local elections \'The United States strongly condemns the use of harsh tactics against protesters and journalists this weekend in cities throughout Russia,\' State Department spokesman Ned Price said in a statement. The European Union\'s foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, said in a post on Twitter that he deplored the authorities \'disproportionate use of force\', while Britain\'s foreign minister, Dominic Raab, condemned the \'use of violence against peaceful protesters and journalists\'. Navalny being taken into custody and the arrests of his supporters were \'troubling indications of further restrictions on civil society and fundamental freedoms,\' he added. \'We call on Russian authorities to release all those detained for exercising their universal rights and for the immediate and unconditional release of Aleksey Navalny,\' Price said, using an alternative spelling. \'We urge Russia to fully cooperate with the international community\'s investigation into the poisoning of Aleksey Navalny and credibly explain the use of a chemical weapon on its soil.\' Protesters in the county\'s east defied bitter cold and a ban by authorities by also staging rallies to demand the release of Putin\'s nemesis, ahead of the larger cities in the west. Protests against Russia\'s President Vladimir Putin took place in temperatures as low as minus 60F (51C) as police forcibly detained supporters of Kremlin foe Navalny, who was arrested upon his return to Russia from Germany on January 17. Putin\'s most vocal domestic critic called for mass rallies after he was arrested upon his return to Moscow on Sunday. He did so knowing he would likely be arrested after surviving a near-fatal poisoning with a Novichok nerve agent in August and after months of treatment in Germany. He was arrested at Sheremetyevo Airport and jailed. There was no immediate comment from the Kremlin, which had previously called the protests illegal and the work of \'provocateurs\'. State prosecutors said they would look into alleged violence against police officers by protesters. Demonstrations in support of Navalny were also held in the Baltic states of Lithuania and Estonia on Saturday, as well as in Spain\'s Barcelona, with the protesters in Estonia being joined by environmental activist Yevgenia Chirikova, who fled from Russia in 2015 fearing a crackdown on the opposition. In Berlin, Hamburg and Munich, nearly 1,000 people also demonstrated against Navalny\'s arrest. Small demonstrations were also held in Bulgaria and some 200-300 people protested in Paris. Navalny, who accuses Putin of the plot to poison him last August, was locked up until mid-February as he waits to hear whether a suspended prison term will be converted into three-and-a-half years of jail time. Demonstrators shouted \'Shame, shame\' in Pacific capital Vladivostok as heavily armed baton-wielding OMON special forces officers and national guards threw a protester in a police vehicle. The authorities told crowds that their action was unsanctioned and they faced detention unless they dispersed, with video footage from Vladivostok showing riot police chasing a group of protesters down the street. Demonstrators gathered at Moscow\'s central Pushkin Square and nearby streets despite a heavy police presence and detentions.

Demonstrators gathered at Moscow\'s central Pushkin Square and nearby streets despite a heavy police presence and detentions The authorities had warned people to stay away from Saturday\'s protests, saying they risked catching COVID-19 as well as prosecution and possible jail time for attending an unauthorised event In central Moscow, where Reuters reporters estimated at least 40,000 people had gathered in one of the biggest unauthorised rallies for years, police were seen roughly detaining people, bundling them into nearby vans. Russian authorities said just some 4,000 people had shown up to the protest in Moscow on Saturday (pictured) Some protesters chanted \'Putin is a thief\', and \'Disgrace\' and \'Freedom to Navalny!\' Pictured: People face off against police at a rally in support of jailed opposition leader Alexei Navalny in downtown Moscow on January 23 Protesters hold a \'Free Navalny\' banner as they march in Moscow on Saturday.

It reported arrests at rallies in nearly 70 towns and cities Law enforcement officers stand guard in the snow during a rally in support of jailed Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny in Moscow, Russia. There was no immediate comment from the Kremlin, which had previously called the protests illegal and the work of \'provocateurs\' In Moscow, some journalists covering the protests were detained, drawing a rebuke from the U.S. Embassy. Pictured: A man gestures as he climbed up on New Year\'s decorations next to statue of Alexander Pushkin during a protest against the jailing of opposition leader Alexei Navalny in Moscow With the protests continuing to unfold on Saturday, Russia accused the US embassy in Moscow of publishing routes of planned demonstrations in support of Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny and demanded an explanation from American diplomats. \'Yesterday the US embassy in Moscow published \'protest routes\' in Russian cities and tossed around information about a \'march on the Kremlin,\'\' Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova wrote on Facebook, adding: \'US colleagues will have to explain themselves.\' The US embassy in Moscow said Saturday it was following the rallies, adding that Washington supported \'the right of all people to peaceful protest, freedom of expression.\' \'Steps being taken by Russian authorities are suppressing those rights,\' embassy spokeswoman Rebecca Ross said on Twitter.

In Moscow, police put up barricades around Pushkinskaya Square as workers were engaged in re-tiling it, an apparent attempt to thwart a demonstration that was scheduled to start at 1100 GMT. Police also detained a few people gathered on the square before the rally, including a lone picketer. A video reportedly showed a child being manhandled and detained by a Russian policeman at the main rally at Pushkinskaya Square.

Thousands of people gathered in cities across the country including in the Far East on the Pacific coast, Siberia and the Urals, despite police threats to use violence This followed repeated warnings by the authorities that school age students should not attend, and claims they were being used as \'human shields\' by adults. The boy apparently detained, named Sasha, 14, told pro-Kremlin REN TV that he had come to the rally because \'I am just curious what is happening here\'. Asked if he was afraid - after the authorities warned children could be hurt - he said: \'I run fast.\' Asked if he was supporting the anti-Putin demonstrators, he said: \'I just came here to watch.\' People attend a rally in support of jailed Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny in Saint Petersburg, Russia January 23 OMOH officers push people during a rally in support of jailed Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny in Moscow, January 23 Pictured: A general view of a rally in support of jailed Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny in Moscow, Russia January 23 Hundreds of people were pictured at the demonstration in Moscow, Some 369 had been detained in by 2pm in the city In the Russian capital, which usually mobilises the largest rallies, protesters planned to meet on the central Pushkin Square at 2:00 pm (1100 GMT) and march towards the Kremlin But more than an hour before the planned rally police began detaining people, AFP journalists reported. Pictured: Police detain blogger Ilya Varlamov during the rally on Saturday One state TV news broadcast said \'most of the participants are young people, some of whom do not look 18 years old. \'The detainees were escorted to paddy wagons. \'Before that, the police warned activists several times that in the context of the coronavirus pandemic, mass gatherings of people are prohibited.\' In Ufa, a video showed protesters throwing snowballs and scooping up snow to throw at police seeking to break their rally. Another shocking video reportedly showed protesters beaten by OMON riot police in Orenburg as rallies widened to cities all across Russia\'s 11 time zones. At some rallies, protesters shouted \'Aqua disco\', and carried toilet brushes sprayed with gold paint mimicking the gold interior or Putin\'s alleged Black Sea palace. Another video showed shocking protesters in Krasnoyarsk being dragged on the ground by police in minus 15C. In Vladivostok, it was reported that 26 children had been detained. But Vladimir Putin\'s children\'s ombudsman angrily blamed adult protesters for using children as a \'human shield\'. She said: \'Now I know everything about human baseness. Vladivostok - children are standing in a human chain. And adults behind their backs are throwing road cones at OMON [riot police] and hiding again. Who are these people? Are they people?\' Protesters said mobile data was being disrupted around protest sites to stop communications between anti-Putin protesters. Pictured: Protesters run away from law enforcement officers during a rally in support of jailed Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny in Vladivostok, Russia January 23. Around 250 people have been reportedly arrested during the protests The Russian authorities told crowds that their action was unsanctioned and they faced detention unless they dispersed.

In far-eastern city Khabarovsk, crowds chanted \'Putin\'s Dogs\' as law enforcement detained protesters. At one point crowds fought back with police seeking to release those being held. In Kamchatka, nine time zones east of Moscow, protesters carried placards reading \'Corruption is the cancer of our country\' and \'I\'m choosing Freedom\'. While crowds were not huge, protests went ahead in all main cities in the Russian Far East including former GULAG staging post Magadan on the Sea of Okhotsk in a temperature of minus 30C. In Yakutsk - the world\'s coldest city - crowds gathered in minus 51C to support jailed Navalny, who was earlier allegedly poisoned with nerve agent Novichok by an FSB secret service hit squad.

In Siberia city Ulan-Ude extra Saturday classes were put on to prevent school students joining the unsanctioned protests which the authorities said were illegal. In Komsomolsk-on-Amur a squad of OMON detained a dozen people, as the crowd chanted: \'Freedom to political prisoners!\' Navalny\'s supporters say his arrest when he returned from Germany on Sunday was politically motivated. Reports suggest he may be hit with new legal action that could see him remain behind bars for more than a decade.

Protests against Vladimir Putin took place in temperatures as low as minus 60F (51C) Navalny - a 44-year-old lawyer who has dedicated himself to toppling strongman Putin - styles himself an anti-corruption campaigner who despite being behind bars in recent days accused the Russian president of using state cash to enrich himself, his family and his cronies. Among the claims is that Putin has built himself a £1 billion palace at Gelendzhik on the Black Sea. Putin denies any wrongdoing. The Kremlin has denied being \'afraid\' of Navalny and his pro-democracy campaigners but are concerned to act tough to prevent mass support growing for a Ukrainian-style revolution. However, it is unclear that Navalny has the mass support he would need to overthrow ex-KGB spy Putin who has been president or prime minister for 21 years. Bigger protests were expected later in Moscow and St Petersburg, led by Navalny\'s wife Yulia who announced she planned to take to the streets in support of her jailed husband.

In Moscow, mayor Sergei Sobyanin had warned the rallies were \'unacceptable\' during a pandemic, and police would take action to ensure public order. In Berlin, Hamburg and Munich, nearly 1,000 people demonstrated against Navalny\'s arrest. Small demonstrations were also held in Bulgaria and some 200-300 people protested in Paris. Police in Siberia\'s Yakutsk, one of the coldest cities in the world, where the temperature was -52 Celsius (-62 F) on Saturday, grabbed a protester by his arms and legs and dragged him into a van, video footage showed. In Moscow, some journalists covering the protests were detained, drawing a rebuke from the U.S. Embassy. ""Russian authorities arresting peaceful protesters, journalists,"" spokesperson Rebecca Ross said on Twitter. ""Appears to be a concerted campaign to suppress free speech, peaceful assembly."" Navalny called for his supporters to take to the streets after a hastily organised court ordered him jailed for 30 days on Monday. The makeshift court - set up in a police station on the outskirts of Moscow where Navalny was being held - ruled he be held in custody until February 15 when he will appear in court on corruption charges. The 44-year-old anti-corruption campaigner previously was handed a suspended sentence for the charges in 2014. Russia now accuses him of breaching the terms of that sentence by not checking in with police as often as he should have done. In a video released by his team shortly after the ruling, Navalny urged his supporters to take to the streets and protest as Western governments called for his immediate release. Russia\'s most prominent opposition leader Alexei Navalny has called on Monday for his supporters to take to the streets after a hastily organised court ordered him jailed for 30 days Police officers stand outside a police station where detained Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny is being held, in Khimki outside Moscow, Russia January 18 But Kremlin press secretary Dmitry Peskov said Tuesday that Russia\'s leaders did not fear mass protests - adding that they had heard the Western outrage but \'cannot and are not going to take these statements into account\'. He also rejected the suggestion that Putin was afraid of Navalny, following claims by the Kremlin critic\'s supporters that putting him in prison could turn him into a Nelson Mandela-like symbol of resistance. The Investigative Committee, which probes major crimes, said Friday it launched a criminal probe into the calls for unauthorised protests. It comes as Navalny released a statement from prison on Tuesday, saying he had no regrets about returning to Russia despite his arrest.

I refuse to put up with the lawlessness of the authorities [in] my country. I refuse to stay silent, listening to the shameless lies of Putin and his friends, mired in corruption.\' On the eve of the rallies, Navalny, who is being held in Moscow\'s high-security Matrosskaya Tishina jail, thanked his supporters. \'I know perfectly well that there are lots of good people outside of my prison\'s walls and help will come,\' he said on Friday. Navalny\'s wife Yulia said she would join the protest in Moscow. \'For myself, for him, for our children, for the values and the ideals that we share,\' she said on Instagram. Ahead of the demonstrations several key Navalny aides were taken into police custody for violating protest laws and handed short jail sentences to keep them away from the rallies. Navalny and his wife sit on the tarmac in Berlin before flying back to Russia on Sunday, five months after he was airlifted to Germany in a coma following his Novichok poisoning Alexei Navalny with his wife Yulia at Moscow\'s Sheremetyevo airport on Sunday where he was arrested after returning to Russia from Germany Navalny\'s team this week released an investigation into an opulent Black Sea property allegedly owned by Putin. The \'Putin\'s palace\' report alleges the Russian leader owns a 17,691 square metre mansion that sits on a property 39 times the size of Monaco and features a casino along with a theatre and a hookah lounge complete with a pole-dancing stage. The two-hour video report had been viewed more than 65 million times since Tuesday, becoming the Kremlin critic\'s most-watched YouTube investigation. The Kremlin has denied the property belongs to Putin. Many Russians took to social media - including video sharing app TikTok hugely popular with teens - to voice support and urge a large turnout on Saturday. A hashtag demanding freedom for Navalny was trending on TikTok as Russians flooded the Chinese app with thousands of videos. Russia\'s media watchdog warned online platforms against encouraging minors to participate in the rallies or risk hefty fines. The watchdog said on Friday that media platforms, including TikTok, YouTube and Instagram, removed content at its request. Russia\'s most popular social network VKontakte blocked groups created to coordinate the protests in different cities. But a number of public figures - including those who usually steer clear of politics - have spoken out in Navalny\'s support. Navalny (centre in a green jacket) was photographed being escorted from the police station in Khimski on Monday evening The opposition leader appeared to shout to hit supporters gathered outside the station as he was being escorted from the building Navalny, 44, flashed a peace sign to photographers and supporters as he was escorted from the police station where he has been detained into a van How Alexei Navalny has been punished for defying Putin 2011: Navalny is arrested and jailed for 15 days for \'defying an official\' after leading protests in Moscow 2012: Jailed for 15 days after leading an anti-Putin protest in the wake of presidential elections. His apartment is subsequently raided, and some of his private emails posted online 2013: Put on trial for embezzlement, amid claims he tried to steal wood from a state-owned company. He is convicted and sentenced to five years, but allowed out on bail. The conviction is subsequently overturned 2014: Placed under house arrest, again charged with embezzlement alongside brother Oleg. Again, the conviction is overturned 2017: He is re-convicted in the first corruption case, and ordered to repay millions of rubles of compensation in the second While leaving his office, a pro-Kremlin activist throws green disinfectant dye in his face, partially blinding him 2018: Arrested twice for leading protests against presidential elections he was barred from running in. Jailed for a total of 50 days in jail 2019: Arrested and jailed for a total of 40 days for leading protests during Moscow Duma elections. While in jail he was rushed to hospital, suffering from what medics called an allergic reaction. Others believe he was poisoned 2020: Navalny is rushed unconscious to hospital and placed on a ventilator after falling ill on a flight. His allies say he was poisoned August 22, 2020: Navalny is transferred from a hospital in Siberia to another hospital in Berlin September 2020: German scientists revealed tests confirmed he was poisoned by Novichok nerve agent December 2020: Bellingcat investigation alleges Moscow\'s FSB agency began tracking Nevalny after he announced plans to run against Putin before launching an assassination attempt in August using Novichok December 2020: Navalny claimed he had tricked an FSB agent into admitting on a phone call Russian assassins tried to kill him using poisoned underpants and then tried to cover it up. The FSB dismissed the recording as fake January 2021: Navalny is arrested at Moscow\'s Sheremetyevo airport after Russia\'s prison service alleged he had violated parole terms from a suspended sentence on a 2014 embezzlement conviction Advertisement Navalny rose to prominence a decade ago and has become the central figure of Russia\'s opposition movement, leading large-scale street protests against corruption and electoral fraud. His arrest drew widespread Western condemnation, with the United States, the European Union, France and Canada all calling for his release. Navalny\'s anti-corruption foundation said that the 44-year-old was \'illegally detained\' and that \'lawyers are not allowed to see him\'. The opposition leader had joked with journalists on the plane from Berlin on Sunday. \'All the criminal cases against me are fabricated,\' he added. After the plane landed, Navalny kissed his wife Yulia before four masked police officers escorted him away at passport control, before he had formally entered Russia. He reappeared on Monday morning at a Moscow police station where a court hearing to extend his detention was already underway. \'It is impossible what is happening over here,\' Navalny said in a video from the improvised courtroom. \'It is lawlessness of the highest degree. \'One minute ago I was taken out of my cell to meet the lawyer, I came here, and here a hearing of the [court] is happening.\' Navalny\'s lawyers said the immediate court hearing was an unexpected turn of events, saying they were only notified about it minutes earlier. According to a police notice distributed published Navalny\'s lawyer Vadim Kobzev, the legal process began at 12.30pm local time on Monday. The Moscow prison service had warned that it would arrest Navalny once he returned. It accused Navalny of flouting the terms of a three-and-a-half-year suspended prison sentence in a 2014 embezzlement case. Navalny\'s supporters had gathered at Moscow\'s Vnukovo airport despite bitterly cold weather and more than 4,500 new coronavirus cases a day in the Russian capital. But they were denied a glimpse of Navalny after the flight path was switched at the last minute and the plane landed at Sheremetyevo instead. OVD Info, which monitors detentions at political protests in Russia, said at least 55 people had been detained at the airport. Prominent Moscow activist Lyubov Sobol was among those arrested, saying later that they had been released and were facing administrative charges. The latest episode in the Navalny saga has led to calls for more sanctions against Russia, amid a wave of condemnation from Western countries. Donald Trump\'s outgoing secretary of state Mike Pompeo said on Twitter: \'Deeply troubled by Russia\'s decision to arrest Alexei Navalny. \'Confident political leaders do not fear competing voices, nor see the need to commit violence against or wrongfully detain, political opponents,\' he said. France also called for Navalny\'s release and voiced its \'strong concern\' over his arrest in Russia. Putin\'s spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, responded to a question about the arrest by saying \'Was he arrested in Germany? I\'m not up to date,\' according to Russian media. The Kremlin typically belittles Navalny by referring to him merely as the \'Berlin patient\' and calling him a blogger rather than a politician. Navalny fell into a coma while aboard a domestic flight from Siberia to Moscow on August 20. He was airlifted from a hospital in Siberia to Berlin two days later, where a military lab found evidence of Novichok. Russian authorities insisted that the doctors who treated Navalny in Siberia before he was airlifted to Germany found no traces of poison and have challenged German officials to provide proof of his poisoning. Navalny with his wife and children after waking from his coma at the Berlin hospital where doctors say his previous good health contributed to his recovery The Kremlin has rejected calls to open a full investigation into the poisoning, and denied Navalny\'s claims that the FSB security agency was behind the plot. Last month Navalny claimed he had duped an FSB agent into confessing details of the plot in a recorded phone call which the agency dismissed as fake. The alleged plotter, Konstantin Kudryavtsev, was one of a team of alleged chemical weapons experts named last month as suspects in Navalny\'s poisoning. The recording purported to reveal that Navalny\'s underpants had been sprinkled with the nerve agent while he was staying at a hotel in Siberia.

There is a \'surge\' in communication among members of the alleged FSB unit August 20: Navalny boards the flight in Tomsk and becomes critically ill on board, forcing an emergency landing August 22: The unconscious Navalny is airlifted to Berlin. A German military lab later finds evidence of Novichok Advertisement Navalny was initially treated at a hospital in Omsk before Russian authorities agreed to hand him over to a German air ambulance crew on August 22. In an article in The Lancet, doctors at Berlin\'s Charite hospital described how Navalny had to be ventilated and given drugs during his airlift to Germany. Medics described how he had become confused and sweaty before vomiting and collapsing on the domestic flight in Siberia, leaving him unconscious and drooling when the plane made an emergency landing. By the time he arrived at the Berlin hospital, more than two days after falling ill, his heart had slowed well below an adult\'s usual range of 60 to 100 beats per minute and his brain was starting to show signs of reduced responsiveness. When he arrived in intensive care, he was showing \'decreased brainstem reflexes\' and suffering from hypothermia with a body temperature of just 33.5C (92.5F). Navalny was treated with atropine for 10 days and given other antibiotics by the hospital doctors, who said he started to breathe spontaneously within two weeks. As his condition improved, he was brought out of a coma, and doctors determined that difficulties understanding speech and speaking he had initially showed after waking up disappeared after three weeks. On the 24th day after falling ill, he was taken off mechanical ventilation, and two days later he was moved from intensive care into a normal hospital ward. Navalny has been a thorn in the Kremlin\'s side for more than a decade, exposing what he says is high-level corruption and mobilising protests. He has been repeatedly detained for organising public meetings, sued over corruption investigations and was barred from running against Putin in the 2018 presidential election. The 44-year-old has also served several stints in jail in recent years for organising anti-Kremlin protests. The European Court of Human Rights has ruled that Russia\'s arrests and detention of Navalny in 2012 and 2014 were politically motivated.', ""The move sparked panic as flights out of Russia sold out as civilians try to escape a potentially being called up Police wearing blacked-out helmets are dragging anti-mobilisation protestors off the streets of Russia tonight, as thousands come out to demonstrate against being sent to the front lines in Ukraine. More than 1,000 people have been arrested tonight in 37 cities across Russia, including Moscow and St Petersburg, as they voiced their anger at President Vladimir Putin's order to mobilise 300,000 reservists. There have been angry clashes between activists and security forces, with protestors being forcefully taken to the ground and removed from the streets as the government cracks down on vocal dissent. Demonstrators tonight chanted anti-war slogans, with some calling for Putin himself to go to the trenches in Ukraine, while other's have angrily proclaimed they're not willing to die for him. It is reported a total of 828 arrests have been made so far, with this number likely to rise throughout the night as the government cracks down on vocal dissent. In the capital Moscow 303 people have been arrested, while the former imperial capital of St Petersburg saw 279 taken into custody, and 40 more have been arrested in Yekaterinburg, a city east of the Ural Mountains. As protests spread, many men of fighting age opted to try and leave the country, driven by fears the border might soon be closed, with tickets for one-way flights out of Moscow being snapped up by worried Russians. The decision to mobilise the country is the first of its type in the country since the Second World War, and has come as Russian forces sustain humiliating losses to advancing Ukrainian troops in the east of the country. The first protests against the partial mobilisation took place in Siberia, with demonstrators risking being jailed under draconian laws forbidding criticism of the armed forces. Videos circulating on social media show people marching through the streets of Moscow chanting 'no to war', and mass arrests by armed police wearing riot gear and all black clothing. One protester was hauled into detention in Novosibirsk after shouting at police and FSB officers at a rally: 'I am not going to die for Putin, or for you!'

Protestors at an unsanctioned rally against the mobilisation of reservists in Moscow were dragged away by Russian police officers More than 100 demonstrators holding 'no to mobilisation' signs and chanting anti-war slogans have been dragged away by armed police trying to stamp out the unrest across the country.

The man was loudly clapped by other protesters at the anti-war rally in Siberia's unofficial capital police officer bellowed at him: 'I demand you to stop this illegal activity.' A protester's voice is heard saying 'What are you doing?' as he is detained, while another asks: 'Are you animals?' One more voice said: 'They are [protesting] so as not to be sent there [to the war in Ukraine].' Anger has also erupted on social media and a new word was even invented to describe the hell Putin has unleashed - 'Mogilisation', from the Russian word 'Могила' [Mogila] - or grave, the morbid fate awaiting thousands drafted into the army. While some took to the streets, others tried to flee the regime and ticket prices duly skyrocketed, with a family of three having to fork out £44,000 to fly to Johannesburg, while the cheapest flights to Dubai were costing more than £8,000 - about ten times the average monthly wage, for a one-way economy fare.

Kirill Martynov, editor-in-chief of the opposition news site, claimed Putin has declared war 'on his people and his country' with the controversial mobilisation order. He wrote: 'The panic of the Russian Federation and the indifference of Ukraine are not accidental. Putin's announcement of an allegedly partial, limited mobilisation is much more dangerous for the Russians themselves. 'Until recently, the main problem of Russian citizens was the inability to buy currency or the withdrawal of Western brands from the country, and now the national sport of men will be salvation from the front, saving life, health and, if possible, freedom. 'Vladimir Putin really wants to enter into some kind of history and drags along the people who still hoped to live. 'Having started an unreasonable, aggressive war against a neighbouring sovereign country, annexing its territories, destroying his own soldiers for the sake of illusions of geopolitics and amateur lectures on history, blackmailing the world with a nuclear bomb, and finally starting mobilization, Vladimir Putin declared war on his people and country.' Advertisement According to Russian investigative news outlet RBK, all plane tickets to countries where Russians would not need a visa, including Turkey, Armenia and Georgia, have now sold out, while flagship airline Aeroflot is not displaying any available flights. Some alleged people already had been turned back from Russia's land border with Georgia and that the website of the state Russian railway company collapsed because too many people were checking for ways out of the country. Putin's apocalyptic nuclear warnings have prompted even China to demand a ceasefire 'through dialogue and consultation', while Turkey's Recep Tayyip Erdogan said Putin should return all occupied land, including Crimea, to its 'rightful owners'. Meanwhile the US will retaliate with 'a devastating strike' if Putin uses nuclear weapons, the United States Army's former European commander has warned. Russian Railways and Aeroflot said they hadn't 'yet' been ordered to ban men aged 18 to 65 from boarding. A group based in Serbia, Russians, Belarussians, Ukrainians and Serbs Together Against War, tweeted that there were no available flights to Belgrade from Russia until mid-October. Flights to Turkey, Georgia or Armenia also sold out, according to the Belgrade-based group. Alexei Navalny, Russia's most prominent opposition leader, said Putin was sending more Russians to their deaths for a failing war. 'It is clear that the criminal war is getting worse, deepening, and Putin is trying to involve as many people as possible in this,' Navalny said in a video message from jail recorded and published by his lawyers. 'He wants to smear hundreds of thousands of people in this blood,' Navalny said. The tyrant's announcement, made in an early-morning television address, raised fears that some men of fighting age would not be allowed to leave Russia. Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu said the call-up would be limited to those with experience as professional soldiers, and that students and those who had only served as conscripts would not be called up. Nevertheless, the move has raised fears of mass conscription in the worrying escalation of the war. A former top Russian state TV presenter on propagandist Channel One, Zhanna Agalokova, 56, today publicly denounced Putin - and sent back honours she had been awarded. In a letter she told the warmonger: 'Mr President, your leadership is plunging the country into the abyss. I consider awards given by you as unacceptable.' Meanwhile a mixture of fear, anger, and dissent was spreading across Russian social media networks. 'I am super worried for my young male friends and my boyfriend,' said one woman, 28, from a city thousands of miles east of the Kremlin where the Russian president issued his fateful TV call-up. Lilianna D demanded: 'I recommend mobilising the entire Duma [parliament] and their families first of all. And let people see how loyal they are.' Andrey Shipilov, a Cyprus-based Russian journalist, posted: 'A friend from Russia has just messaged…an entire institute's [graduates], all reserve officers, have already been called up this morning'. Putin vowed that he will use 'all available means' to defend what he sees as Russian territory, adding: 'I'm not bluffing' (pictured, a Russian nuclear test) Russia has announced plans for referendums to take place in four regions of Ukraine it either fully or partially occupied - Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson The benchmark rouble-based MOEX index hit its lowest point since February 24 Screaming former Putin advisor warns despot is ready to NUKE Britain A former Russian MP and Putin advisor declared that British cities will be targeted by Putin's nukes in a bare-faced tirade this morning on the Today programme. Sergei Markov had barely exchanged pleasantries with BBC Radio 4 host Justin Webb when he launched into a series of threats about nuclear war. 'It's not a good morning for everybody. In Russia there's partial mobilisation and for your British listeners Vladimir Putin told you that he would be ready to use nuclear weapons against Western countries... including against Great Britain. 'Your cities will be targeted.' Markov, who was elected to Russia's State Duma in 2007 representing Putin's United Russia party, is now a professor of international relations at a Moscow university and has a history of spouting Putin's rhetoric in Western media. 'If Great Britain will continue to be aggressor against Russia... if Prime Minister of Great Britain Liz Truss still has a plan to destroy Russia, people in London should understand the threat [of nuclear weapons],' he said. Markov's unhinged comments today came moments after the Russian president announced partial mobilisation to reinforce his faltering war in Ukraine and delivered his most pronounced nuclear threat yet towards the West. Markov from the get-go set about decrying Western involvement in the Russia-Ukraine conflict and accused the West of using Ukrainian soldiers as 'slaves' to deplete the Russian army. 'It was absolutely clear that Russia has no war against Ukraine...there's no reason to use tactical nuclear weapons against Ukrainians,' he said. 'But Ukraine is occupied by Western countries... it's Western countries fighting against Russian army, using Ukrainian soldiers as their slaves. This was the main idea of Vladimir Putin.' Bemused host Justin Webb allowed Markov to reach a conclusion before calmly asking whether the ex-Putin aide and the Russian people believed there could be a winner in a nuclear war. 'Everybody in the world is now thinking about nuclear war... which could be the result of crazy behaviour of US president Joe Biden and prime ministers of Great Britain Boris Johnson and [Liz] Truss,' Markov retorted. Advertisement Putin's gambit comes after Ukraine routed a large part of the Russian army last week, leaving him backed into a corner of his own making and facing the possible collapse of his so-called 'special military operation'. But rather than back down, the Russian leader has instead chosen to double down and hold the free world to ransom - putting Russia and its huge nuclear arsenal on direct collision course with Ukraine and its allies, who have already vowed not to accept the results of 'sham' referendums or to stop liberating occupied territory. Retired Lieutenant General Ben Hodges today said any response by America 'may not be nuclear' but warned that if Putin were to use nukes in Ukraine that the US could look to 'destroy the Black Sea Fleet or destroy Russian bases in Crimea'. Gen Hodges, who commanded the US Army in Europe between 2014 and 2018, stressed the 'possibility' of Putin ordering a nuclear strike on Ukraine was 'very unlikely'. But he said the use of any strategic weapons of mass destruction would be met with a swift and severe reaction from President Joe Biden. 'He [Putin] knows the US will have to respond if Russia uses a nuclear weapon,' Gen Hodges told MailOnline. 'The US response may not be nuclear...but could very well be a devastating strike that could, for example, destroy the Black Sea Fleet or destroy Russian bases in Crimea. 'So, I think President Putin and those around him will be reluctant to draw the US into the conflict directly.' John Kirby, spokesman for the White House's National Security Council, said Putin's nuclear threat was 'irresponsible' and it would be taken 'seriously' by the US. The White House official reiterated previous comments by President Joe Biden when asked what the US response would be to Russia reaching for its nuclear arsenal, which analysts speculate could mean detonating a demonstration blast over the Black Sea, using battlefield nuclear warheads to limit the radiation, or ultimately using a larger weapon. 'There'll be severe consequences. Not only will he be that much more of pariah on the world stage, but there'll have to be severe consequences that the international community will have.' NATO's secretary general Jens Stoltenberg added that Putin was issuing 'dangerous and reckless rhetoric', but it demonstrated 'that the war is not going according to his plans' and it was clear that the Russian president had made 'a big miscalculation'. Speaking ahead of Putin's speech last night, President Zelensky dismissed 'noise' from Russia and said it will not alter Ukraine's resolve. Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba likewise vowed: 'The Russians can do whatever they want. It will not change anything. Ukraine has every right to liberate its territories and will keep liberating them whatever Russia has to say.' Mykhailo Podolyak, an adviser to Ukrainian President Volodrymyr Zelensky, spoke out this morning after Putin's announcement - calling it 'predictable' and saying it show the war is not going to plan. President Joe Biden is expected to give a speech to the UN later today when he will rally Ukraine's allies to stay the course. Retired Lieutenant General Ben Hodges, who commanded the US Army in Europe between 2014 and 2018, said the chance of Putin nuking Ukraine was 'very unlikely' The US could launch 'devastating strikes' on Russian military targets in Crimea and the Black Sea, pictured, if Putin nukes Ukraine, a former US Army commander has warned today 'This will hurt Russia more than it hurts Ukraine': Why Putin's 300,000 reservists WON'T win the war – and could end up backfiring Vladimir Putin today ordered the first mobilisation of Russia’s military reserves since the Second World War in an attempt to turn around his failing war in Ukraine. Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu claimed that 300,000 men – twice the size of the original invading force – will be pressed into service, including veterans and those with ‘special skills’ the army needs. But, according to Dr Stepan Stepanenko, the lead Russia Research Fellow at the Henry Jackson Society, the new recruits are unlikely to turn the tide in Putin’s favour. He told MailOnline: ‘They will be cannon fodder, it’s as simple as that. 300,000 is a lot, even if you give them sticks it will make a difference. ‘But it is unlikely the Russian infrastructure, particularly the corrupt military infrastructure, can deploy them all at the same time. They will probably be deployed bit by bit, they will get killed off bit by bit, and it won't make much difference to the overall war. ‘If anything, it will swing the war in Ukraine’s favour rather than Russia’s. Already there are protests in Russia by those who don’t want to go. ‘They don’t have the modern tanks or modern planes they did a few months ago. There was talk in Putin's speech about setting the entire country on a war footing, but it has not yet happened and I'm not sure the Russian people will be able to do it. The corruption in Russia is so high that any kind of turnaround is highly improbable.’ Viktorija Starych-Samuolienė, the co-founder of the Council on Geostrategy, agreed. She told MailOnline: ‘It is important to remember that [Defence Minister Sergei] Shoigu has given wildly inaccurate statements in the past, and his figure of 300,000 conscripts may prove to be another one of these. ‘Regardless of the true number of newly called-up soldiers, it will take time for them to be equipped, trained and transported to the front lines. ‘One of the biggest challenges the Russian military currently faces is in logistics: soldiers not having armour plating or the right type of shovels, using decades-old equipment and vehicles, no secure communications methods etc… This problem will not go away and will almost certainly become worse with the addition of (for argument's sake) 300,000 new soldiers.’ Advertisement Podolyak said mobilisation will prove extremely unpopular within Russia, and accused Putin of trying to shift the blame for starting an 'unprovoked war' and crashing the economy on to the West. It is thought the mobilisation will press around 300,000 people into the Russian army - around twice the size of the force that Putin invaded with. But it is unclear when exactly these men will become available, and the move will do nothing to solve Russia's chronic lack of equipment, supplies and other logistical issues that have spelled disaster for its invasion so-far. Putin had resisted declaring any kind of mobilistion until now, apparently fearing backlash from Russians who may have been supporting his 'special military operation' only because they had nothing to lose. But the Russian leader dramatically changed tack under pressure from allies, propagandists and hardliners after another humiliating military defeat near Kharkiv last week which had sparked calls for him to resign. He was at pains to stress that the mobilisation is only partial, and will not affect ordinary citizens, conscripts or students. Those called up to service - starting today - will be those with experience of service and combat, he insisted. Speaking after Putin, Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu gave a rare update on Russian casualty figures, preposterously claiming that only 6,000 Kremlin troops have been killed in the war so far. Ukrainian losses, he said, were ten times that: 61,000 dead in addition to 49,000 wounded. In a speech delayed for 13 hours overnight - triggering wishful rumours of a coup inside the Kremlin - Putin delivered his twisted interpretation of the war to date. He attempted to rewrite history to paint the West and NATO as the aggressor - saying they had pushed Ukraine into a war with Russia, despite ordering an invasion of the country himself just seven months ago. Ukraine began the war back in 2014, he said - referring to the date of Russia's last invasion - when the 'Nazi' regime in Kyiv had turned the military on its own civilians in an attempted genocide following what he called a 'coup' to oust the country's last pro-Kremlin leader. In Putin's retelling, the West 'refused a peaceful solution' and instead began rearming Ukraine for an attack on the Donbas - leaving him with no choice but to launch a pre-emptive war to protect people. He falsely claimed that peace negotiations with Ukraine were deliberately undermined by Kyiv's bloody-minded Western allies, who then began training and equipping its armed forces with the goal of destroying Russia. Attacks on schools and hospitals are not the work of the Russian army, as reams of evidence suggests, but are in fact the work of Ukrainian Nazis and nationalists, he said. Facing these threats, Putin said he has no choice but to accept the requests of his puppet leaders in occupied Ukraine to hold referendums on joining Russia, and no choice but to call up his military reserves. He added: 'In its aggressive anti-Russian policies, the West has crossed all lines... There are plans in Washington and Brussels to move the military action on to Russian territory. A dead soldier lies on the ground in Ukraine as Putin dramatically escalates his war A refrigerated train filled with the bodies of Putin's fallen troops returns from Ukraine earlier in the war 'Doctors called after Putin suffered coughing fit amid chaotic scenes behind TV address' Doctors were called to Putin's aid amid behind the scenes chaos as he prepared to issue his doomsday nuclear threats, Kremlin rumours have claimed. The Russian tyrant allegedly suffered coughing fits and chest pains in the lead-up to his TV address, which was delayed for 13 hours. The General SVR Telegram channel, believed to be run by a former Kremlin insider which had predicted the mobilisation move, said Putin's speech had to be re-recorded multiple times because of his ill health. They also claimed that three key figures threatened to resign over the president's dramatic escalation, including the respected Elvira Nabiullina, the head of the Russian central bank who has kept the economy afloat amid Western sanctions. The Telegram channel said: 'Several attempts to start recording an appeal were frustrated due to coughing. 'After the fourth unsuccessful attempt to record an appeal, doctors were called to the president, to whom Putin also complained of chest pains.' Advertisement 'They are not just talking about Russia being destroyed on the battlefield, they are talking about political, cultural, and all other types of sovereignty with complete pillage. Now they're talking about nuclear blackmail. 'Those who make such statements will be reminded that our country also has various weapons of destruction and with regard to certain components they are even more modern than the NATO ones. 'If there is any threat to the territorial integrity of our country and to protect our people we will certainly use all means available to us. I'm not bluffing. 'Russia citizens can be certain that the territorial integrity of our motherland, our independence and security will be assured. I shall stress - by all means available to us 'And those trying to blackmail us with nuclear weapons should know that the tables can turn on them 'In our historic tradition our people had it in their destiny to stop those how are trying to subjugate our motherland and it will happen now.' The allegations are an almost exact inversion of everything Russia has been accused of doing, and is a common trope of Kremlin propaganda. Referendums will begin this week into next week, according to Russia occupation authorities, with the results expected to be announced shortly after. Police and officials will go door-to-door to ensure people cast their votes, they said, leaving few doubts about which way they will be voting. Ballot boxes will also be set up inside Russia itself, ostensibly to allow those who have already fled those regions a chance to cast a vote - but in all likelihood will be stuffed with fake ballots. Early 'polling' released by Russian state media last night showed - unsurprisingly - that more than 80 per cent of people in the four regions want to join Russia. In Donetsk and Luhansk - the focus of Putin's war effort - the reported figure was over 90 per cent.

White House spokesman Jake Sullivan described the votes as a violation of Ukrainian sovereignty which carry 'no legitimacy'. Emmanuel Macron, speaking at the UN where heads of state are gathered for a general assembly, said that if Moscow's plan 'wasn't so tragic it would be funny.' German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said Putin will only give up his 'imperial ambitions' that risk destroying Ukraine and Russia if he recognises he cannot win the war. 'This is why we will not accept any peace dictated by Russia and this is why Ukraine must be able to fend off Russia's attack,' Scholz said. Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida told the assembly the U.N.'s credibility was in danger because of the invasion by Russia, a permanent member of the Security Council, and reforms of the council were needed. 'Russia's invasion of Ukraine is a conduct that tramples the philosophy and principles of the U.N. charter ... It should never be tolerated,' Kishida said. Ukraine's Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba vowed that: 'The Russians can do whatever they want. It will not change anything. 'Ukraine has every right to liberate its territories and will keep liberating them whatever Russia has to say.' If the referendum plan 'wasn't so tragic it would be funny,' French President Emmanuel Macron told reporters ahead of the U.N. assembly in New York. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said Putin will only give up his 'imperial ambitions' that risk destroying Ukraine and Russia if he recognises he cannot win the war. 'This is why we will not accept any peace dictated by Russia and this is why Ukraine must be able to fend off Russia's attack,' Scholz said in his first address to the General Assembly. Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida told the assembly the U.N.'s credibility was in danger because of the invasion by Russia, a permanent member of the Security Council, and reforms of the council were needed. 'Russia's invasion of Ukraine is a conduct that tramples the philosophy and principles of the U.N. charter ... It should never be tolerated,' Kishida said. 'The situation on at the front clearly indicates the initiative is with Ukraine,' Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said in a video address released early on Wednesday. Ukraine's position did not change because of 'some noise' from Russia, Zelensky added in a reference to the referendums. Advertisement Russia is now almost seven months into what was intended to be a days-long war in Ukraine, and the situation for its troops is becoming increasingly desperate. Having been forced to retreat from Kyiv in the early months of fighting after its advance stalled, the Kremlin's war machine instead focused its efforts on 'liberating' the eastern Donbas region. Months of grinding warfare saw Russia capture the whole of the Luhansk region, but only around half of neighbouring Donetsk - which make up the Donbas. As Russia's advances slowed and then stopped, Ukraine went on the counter-attack - launching an offensive on the southern city of Kherson. Russia moved forces from other areas of the country to help defend the city, at which point Ukraine launched a second counter-attack east out of Kharkiv - in the north. That move caught the Kremlin's commanders completely off guard, triggering a rout that handed 3,000 square miles of territory that Russia had spent months capturing back to Ukraine in just a few days. And Kyiv has continued to press the attack, regaining a foothold in the Luhansk region and threatening to push further across the province. Faced with war on two fronts and not enough men to hold the territory he has already captured, Putin was left with few options but to begin conscripting men. However, experts and analysts say it will do little to turn the tide of the war in his favour. It will take at least weeks, possibly months, to gather, equip, train and transport hundreds of thousands more men to the frontlines - time that Russia does not have. By the time reinforcements arrive winter will be setting in when combat operations will be considerably harder, compounding the issues that Russia's military already faces. And mobilising more men will do nothing to solve the chronic lack of equipment and supplies among Russia's ranks, or fix the logistical issues which have hampered its attacks. Some drew comparisons with the disastrous Winter War that the Soviet Union fought against Finland, which ended with hundreds of thousands of Red Army troops dead or wounded to around 25,000 Finnish. Western leaders had pre-empted Putin's remarks at the UN last night, saying they would not recognise the results of any 'sham' referendums in Ukraine. 'The Russians can do whatever they want. It will not change anything,' Ukraine's Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said on Tuesday as world leaders were arriving for the United Nations General Assembly meeting. He later doubled down on the issue, tweeting: 'Sham 'referendums' will not change anything. Neither will any hybrid 'mobilization.' 'Russia has been and remains an aggressor illegally occupying parts of Ukrainian land. Ukraine has every right to liberate its territories and will keep liberating them whatever Russia has to say.' French President Emmanuel Macron said that if the referendum plan 'wasn't so tragic it would be funny.' He described Russia's invasion as 'a return to a new age of imperialism and colonies' and warned that inaction risked 'tearing down the global order without which peace is not possible.' 'It's not a matter of choosing one side between East and West, or North or South. It's a matter of responsibility' to the UN Charter, he said. Putin lashed out at the free world after his military suffered a humiliating rout near Kharkiv last week that handed a swathe of territory back to Ukraine (pictured, destroyed Russian tanks) Russia is increasingly resorting to desperate moves to hold on to the territory it has seized in Ukraine, including the apparent use of incendiary weapons (pictured) Meanwhile, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said the world was 'facing a new fragmentation' after years of hope following the end of the Cold War and his own nation's reunification. Chancellor Olaf Scholz said the world was 'facing a new fragmentation' after years of hope following the end of the Cold War and his own nation's reunification. Scholz said that President Vladimir Putin, who invaded Ukraine in February, will 'only give up his war and his imperialist ambitions if he realizes he cannot win.' 'We stand firmly at the side of those under attack — for the protection of the lives and the freedom of the Ukrainians, and for the protection of our international order,' he said. And Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida told the assembly the U.N.'s credibility was in danger because of the invasion by Russia, a permanent member of the Security Council. 'Russia's invasion of Ukraine is a conduct that tramples the philosophy and principles of the U.N. charter ... It should never be tolerated,' Kishida said. President Joe Biden will make an address to the UN today in which he will argue that Russia's 'naked aggression' in Ukraine is an affront to the heart of what the international body stands for. White House officials said the focus of his time at the general assembly will be rallying Ukraine allies to stay the course against Russia, and remain united in the face of Putin's threats. 'He'll offer a firm rebuke of Russia's unjust war in Ukraine and make a call to the world to continue to stand against the naked aggression that we've seen these past several months,' White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan said in previewing the president's address. 'He will underscore the importance of strengthening the United Nations and reaffirm core tenets of its charter at a time when a permanent member of the Security Council has struck at the very heart of the charter by challenging the principle of territorial integrity and sovereignty.' In his nightly address Zelenskyy said there were lots of questions surrounding the announcements but stressed that they would not change Ukraine's commitment to retake areas occupied by Russian forces. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky addressed world leaders at the UN last night, thanking Western leaders for condemning Russia's plans to break away parts of his country Emmanuel Macron was among leaders to address the UN on Ukraine last night, accusing Putin of trying to 'return to an age of imperialism and colonies' 'The situation on the front line clearly indicates that the initiative belongs to Ukraine,' he said. 'Our positions do not change because of the noise or any announcements somewhere. And we enjoy the full support of our partners in this. 'I thank all friends and partners of Ukraine for today's mass principled firm condemnation of Russia's attempts to stage new sham referenda,' Zelensky said. In another signal that Russia is digging in for a protracted and ramped-up conflict, the Kremlin-controlled lower of house of parliament voted Tuesday to toughen laws against desertion, surrender and looting by Russian troops. Lawmakers also voted to introduce possible 10-year prison terms for soldiers refusing to fight. If approved, as expected, by the upper house and then signed by Putin, the legislation would strengthen commanders' hands against failing morale reported among soldiers. In the Russian-occupied city of Enerhodar, shelling continued around Europe's largest nuclear power plant. Ukrainian energy operator Energoatom said Russian shelling again damaged infrastructure at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant and briefly forced workers to start two diesel generators for emergency power to reactor cooling pumps. Such pumps are essential for avoiding a meltdown at a nuclear facility even though all six of the plant's reactors have been shut down. Energoatom said the generators were later switched off as main power weas restored. The Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant has been a focus for concern for months because of fears that shelling could lead to a radiation leak. Russia and Ukraine blame each other for the shelling."", ""The move sparked panic as flights out of Russia sold out as civilians try to escape a potentially being called up Police wearing blacked-out helmets are dragging anti-mobilisation protestors off the streets of Russia tonight, as thousands come out to demonstrate against being sent to the front lines in Ukraine. More than 1,000 people have been arrested tonight in 37 cities across Russia, including Moscow and St Petersburg, as they voiced their anger at President Vladimir Putin's order to mobilise 300,000 reservists. There have been angry clashes between activists and security forces, with protestors being forcefully taken to the ground and removed from the streets as the government cracks down on vocal dissent. Demonstrators tonight chanted anti-war slogans, with some calling for Putin himself to go to the trenches in Ukraine, while other's have angrily proclaimed they're not willing to die for him. It is reported a total of 828 arrests have been made so far, with this number likely to rise throughout the night as the government cracks down on vocal dissent. In the capital Moscow 303 people have been arrested, while the former imperial capital of St Petersburg saw 279 taken into custody, and 40 more have been arrested in Yekaterinburg, a city east of the Ural Mountains. As protests spread, many men of fighting age opted to try and leave the country, driven by fears the border might soon be closed, with tickets for one-way flights out of Moscow being snapped up by worried Russians. The decision to mobilise the country is the first of its type in the country since the Second World War, and has come as Russian forces sustain humiliating losses to advancing Ukrainian troops in the east of the country. The first protests against the partial mobilisation took place in Siberia, with demonstrators risking being jailed under draconian laws forbidding criticism of the armed forces. Videos circulating on social media show people marching through the streets of Moscow chanting 'no to war', and mass arrests by armed police wearing riot gear and all black clothing.

While some took to the streets, others tried to flee the regime and ticket prices duly skyrocketed, with a family of three having to fork out £44,000 to fly to Johannesburg, while the cheapest flights to Dubai were costing more than £8,000 - about ten times the average monthly wage, for a one-way economy fare.

Kirill Martynov, editor-in-chief of the opposition news site, claimed Putin has declared war 'on his people and his country' with the controversial mobilisation order. He wrote: 'The panic of the Russian Federation and the indifference of Ukraine are not accidental. Putin's announcement of an allegedly partial, limited mobilisation is much more dangerous for the Russians themselves. 'Until recently, the main problem of Russian citizens was the inability to buy currency or the withdrawal of Western brands from the country, and now the national sport of men will be salvation from the front, saving life, health and, if possible, freedom. 'Vladimir Putin really wants to enter into some kind of history and drags along the people who still hoped to live. 'Having started an unreasonable, aggressive war against a neighbouring sovereign country, annexing its territories, destroying his own soldiers for the sake of illusions of geopolitics and amateur lectures on history, blackmailing the world with a nuclear bomb, and finally starting mobilization, Vladimir Putin declared war on his people and country.' Advertisement According to Russian investigative news outlet RBK, all plane tickets to countries where Russians would not need a visa, including Turkey, Armenia and Georgia, have now sold out, while flagship airline Aeroflot is not displaying any available flights. Some alleged people already had been turned back from Russia's land border with Georgia and that the website of the state Russian railway company collapsed because too many people were checking for ways out of the country. Putin's apocalyptic nuclear warnings have prompted even China to demand a ceasefire 'through dialogue and consultation', while Turkey's Recep Tayyip Erdogan said Putin should return all occupied land, including Crimea, to its 'rightful owners'. Meanwhile the US will retaliate with 'a devastating strike' if Putin uses nuclear weapons, the United States Army's former European commander has warned. Russian Railways and Aeroflot said they hadn't 'yet' been ordered to ban men aged 18 to 65 from boarding. A group based in Serbia, Russians, Belarussians, Ukrainians and Serbs Together Against War, tweeted that there were no available flights to Belgrade from Russia until mid-October. Flights to Turkey, Georgia or Armenia also sold out, according to the Belgrade-based group. Alexei Navalny, Russia's most prominent opposition leader, said Putin was sending more Russians to their deaths for a failing war. 'It is clear that the criminal war is getting worse, deepening, and Putin is trying to involve as many people as possible in this,' Navalny said in a video message from jail recorded and published by his lawyers. 'He wants to smear hundreds of thousands of people in this blood,' Navalny said. The tyrant's announcement, made in an early-morning television address, raised fears that some men of fighting age would not be allowed to leave Russia. Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu said the call-up would be limited to those with experience as professional soldiers, and that students and those who had only served as conscripts would not be called up. Nevertheless, the move has raised fears of mass conscription in the worrying escalation of the war. A former top Russian state TV presenter on propagandist Channel One, Zhanna Agalokova, 56, today publicly denounced Putin - and sent back honours she had been awarded. In a letter she told the warmonger: 'Mr President, your leadership is plunging the country into the abyss. I consider awards given by you as unacceptable.' Meanwhile a mixture of fear, anger, and dissent was spreading across Russian social media networks. 'I am super worried for my young male friends and my boyfriend,' said one woman, 28, from a city thousands of miles east of the Kremlin where the Russian president issued his fateful TV call-up. Lilianna D demanded: 'I recommend mobilising the entire Duma [parliament] and their families first of all. And let people see how loyal they are.' Andrey Shipilov, a Cyprus-based Russian journalist, posted: 'A friend from Russia has just messaged…an entire institute's [graduates], all reserve officers, have already been called up this morning'. Putin vowed that he will use 'all available means' to defend what he sees as Russian territory, adding: 'I'm not bluffing' (pictured, a Russian nuclear test) Russia has announced plans for referendums to take place in four regions of Ukraine it either fully or partially occupied - Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson The benchmark rouble-based MOEX index hit its lowest point since February 24 Screaming former Putin advisor warns despot is ready to NUKE Britain A former Russian MP and Putin advisor declared that British cities will be targeted by Putin's nukes in a bare-faced tirade this morning on the Today programme. Sergei Markov had barely exchanged pleasantries with BBC Radio 4 host Justin Webb when he launched into a series of threats about nuclear war. 'It's not a good morning for everybody. In Russia there's partial mobilisation and for your British listeners Vladimir Putin told you that he would be ready to use nuclear weapons against Western countries... including against Great Britain. 'Your cities will be targeted.' Markov, who was elected to Russia's State Duma in 2007 representing Putin's United Russia party, is now a professor of international relations at a Moscow university and has a history of spouting Putin's rhetoric in Western media. 'If Great Britain will continue to be aggressor against Russia... if Prime Minister of Great Britain Liz Truss still has a plan to destroy Russia, people in London should understand the threat [of nuclear weapons],' he said. Markov's unhinged comments today came moments after the Russian president announced partial mobilisation to reinforce his faltering war in Ukraine and delivered his most pronounced nuclear threat yet towards the West. Markov from the get-go set about decrying Western involvement in the Russia-Ukraine conflict and accused the West of using Ukrainian soldiers as 'slaves' to deplete the Russian army. 'It was absolutely clear that Russia has no war against Ukraine...there's no reason to use tactical nuclear weapons against Ukrainians,' he said. 'But Ukraine is occupied by Western countries... it's Western countries fighting against Russian army, using Ukrainian soldiers as their slaves. This was the main idea of Vladimir Putin.' Bemused host Justin Webb allowed Markov to reach a conclusion before calmly asking whether the ex-Putin aide and the Russian people believed there could be a winner in a nuclear war. 'Everybody in the world is now thinking about nuclear war... which could be the result of crazy behaviour of US president Joe Biden and prime ministers of Great Britain Boris Johnson and [Liz] Truss,' Markov retorted. Advertisement Putin's gambit comes after Ukraine routed a large part of the Russian army last week, leaving him backed into a corner of his own making and facing the possible collapse of his so-called 'special military operation'. But rather than back down, the Russian leader has instead chosen to double down and hold the free world to ransom - putting Russia and its huge nuclear arsenal on direct collision course with Ukraine and its allies, who have already vowed not to accept the results of 'sham' referendums or to stop liberating occupied territory. Retired Lieutenant General Ben Hodges today said any response by America 'may not be nuclear' but warned that if Putin were to use nukes in Ukraine that the US could look to 'destroy the Black Sea Fleet or destroy Russian bases in Crimea'. Gen Hodges, who commanded the US Army in Europe between 2014 and 2018, stressed the 'possibility' of Putin ordering a nuclear strike on Ukraine was 'very unlikely'. But he said the use of any strategic weapons of mass destruction would be met with a swift and severe reaction from President Joe Biden. 'He [Putin] knows the US will have to respond if Russia uses a nuclear weapon,' Gen Hodges told MailOnline. 'The US response may not be nuclear...but could very well be a devastating strike that could, for example, destroy the Black Sea Fleet or destroy Russian bases in Crimea. 'So, I think President Putin and those around him will be reluctant to draw the US into the conflict directly.' John Kirby, spokesman for the White House's National Security Council, said Putin's nuclear threat was 'irresponsible' and it would be taken 'seriously' by the US. The White House official reiterated previous comments by President Joe Biden when asked what the US response would be to Russia reaching for its nuclear arsenal, which analysts speculate could mean detonating a demonstration blast over the Black Sea, using battlefield nuclear warheads to limit the radiation, or ultimately using a larger weapon. 'There'll be severe consequences. Not only will he be that much more of pariah on the world stage, but there'll have to be severe consequences that the international community will have.' NATO's secretary general Jens Stoltenberg added that Putin was issuing 'dangerous and reckless rhetoric', but it demonstrated 'that the war is not going according to his plans' and it was clear that the Russian president had made 'a big miscalculation'. Speaking ahead of Putin's speech last night, President Zelensky dismissed 'noise' from Russia and said it will not alter Ukraine's resolve. Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba likewise vowed: 'The Russians can do whatever they want. It will not change anything. Ukraine has every right to liberate its territories and will keep liberating them whatever Russia has to say.' Mykhailo Podolyak, an adviser to Ukrainian President Volodrymyr Zelensky, spoke out this morning after Putin's announcement - calling it 'predictable' and saying it show the war is not going to plan. President Joe Biden is expected to give a speech to the UN later today when he will rally Ukraine's allies to stay the course. Retired Lieutenant General Ben Hodges, who commanded the US Army in Europe between 2014 and 2018, said the chance of Putin nuking Ukraine was 'very unlikely' The US could launch 'devastating strikes' on Russian military targets in Crimea and the Black Sea, pictured, if Putin nukes Ukraine, a former US Army commander has warned today 'This will hurt Russia more than it hurts Ukraine': Why Putin's 300,000 reservists WON'T win the war – and could end up backfiring Vladimir Putin today ordered the first mobilisation of Russia’s military reserves since the Second World War in an attempt to turn around his failing war in Ukraine. Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu claimed that 300,000 men – twice the size of the original invading force – will be pressed into service, including veterans and those with ‘special skills’ the army needs. But, according to Dr Stepan Stepanenko, the lead Russia Research Fellow at the Henry Jackson Society, the new recruits are unlikely to turn the tide in Putin’s favour. He told MailOnline: ‘They will be cannon fodder, it’s as simple as that. 300,000 is a lot, even if you give them sticks it will make a difference. ‘But it is unlikely the Russian infrastructure, particularly the corrupt military infrastructure, can deploy them all at the same time. They will probably be deployed bit by bit, they will get killed off bit by bit, and it won't make much difference to the overall war. ‘If anything, it will swing the war in Ukraine’s favour rather than Russia’s. Already there are protests in Russia by those who don’t want to go. ‘They don’t have the modern tanks or modern planes they did a few months ago. There was talk in Putin's speech about setting the entire country on a war footing, but it has not yet happened and I'm not sure the Russian people will be able to do it. The corruption in Russia is so high that any kind of turnaround is highly improbable.’ Viktorija Starych-Samuolienė, the co-founder of the Council on Geostrategy, agreed. She told MailOnline: ‘It is important to remember that [Defence Minister Sergei] Shoigu has given wildly inaccurate statements in the past, and his figure of 300,000 conscripts may prove to be another one of these. ‘Regardless of the true number of newly called-up soldiers, it will take time for them to be equipped, trained and transported to the front lines. ‘One of the biggest challenges the Russian military currently faces is in logistics: soldiers not having armour plating or the right type of shovels, using decades-old equipment and vehicles, no secure communications methods etc… This problem will not go away and will almost certainly become worse with the addition of (for argument's sake) 300,000 new soldiers.’ Advertisement Podolyak said mobilisation will prove extremely unpopular within Russia, and accused Putin of trying to shift the blame for starting an 'unprovoked war' and crashing the economy on to the West. It is thought the mobilisation will press around 300,000 people into the Russian army - around twice the size of the force that Putin invaded with. But it is unclear when exactly these men will become available, and the move will do nothing to solve Russia's chronic lack of equipment, supplies and other logistical issues that have spelled disaster for its invasion so-far. Putin had resisted declaring any kind of mobilistion until now, apparently fearing backlash from Russians who may have been supporting his 'special military operation' only because they had nothing to lose. But the Russian leader dramatically changed tack under pressure from allies, propagandists and hardliners after another humiliating military defeat near Kharkiv last week which had sparked calls for him to resign. He was at pains to stress that the mobilisation is only partial, and will not affect ordinary citizens, conscripts or students. Those called up to service - starting today - will be those with experience of service and combat, he insisted. Speaking after Putin, Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu gave a rare update on Russian casualty figures, preposterously claiming that only 6,000 Kremlin troops have been killed in the war so far. Ukrainian losses, he said, were ten times that: 61,000 dead in addition to 49,000 wounded. In a speech delayed for 13 hours overnight - triggering wishful rumours of a coup inside the Kremlin - Putin delivered his twisted interpretation of the war to date. He attempted to rewrite history to paint the West and NATO as the aggressor - saying they had pushed Ukraine into a war with Russia, despite ordering an invasion of the country himself just seven months ago. Ukraine began the war back in 2014, he said - referring to the date of Russia's last invasion - when the 'Nazi' regime in Kyiv had turned the military on its own civilians in an attempted genocide following what he called a 'coup' to oust the country's last pro-Kremlin leader. In Putin's retelling, the West 'refused a peaceful solution' and instead began rearming Ukraine for an attack on the Donbas - leaving him with no choice but to launch a pre-emptive war to protect people. He falsely claimed that peace negotiations with Ukraine were deliberately undermined by Kyiv's bloody-minded Western allies, who then began training and equipping its armed forces with the goal of destroying Russia. Attacks on schools and hospitals are not the work of the Russian army, as reams of evidence suggests, but are in fact the work of Ukrainian Nazis and nationalists, he said. Facing these threats, Putin said he has no choice but to accept the requests of his puppet leaders in occupied Ukraine to hold referendums on joining Russia, and no choice but to call up his military reserves. He added: 'In its aggressive anti-Russian policies, the West has crossed all lines... There are plans in Washington and Brussels to move the military action on to Russian territory. A dead soldier lies on the ground in Ukraine as Putin dramatically escalates his war A refrigerated train filled with the bodies of Putin's fallen troops returns from Ukraine earlier in the war 'Doctors called after Putin suffered coughing fit amid chaotic scenes behind TV address' Doctors were called to Putin's aid amid behind the scenes chaos as he prepared to issue his doomsday nuclear threats, Kremlin rumours have claimed. The Russian tyrant allegedly suffered coughing fits and chest pains in the lead-up to his TV address, which was delayed for 13 hours. The General SVR Telegram channel, believed to be run by a former Kremlin insider which had predicted the mobilisation move, said Putin's speech had to be re-recorded multiple times because of his ill health. They also claimed that three key figures threatened to resign over the president's dramatic escalation, including the respected Elvira Nabiullina, the head of the Russian central bank who has kept the economy afloat amid Western sanctions. The Telegram channel said: 'Several attempts to start recording an appeal were frustrated due to coughing. 'After the fourth unsuccessful attempt to record an appeal, doctors were called to the president, to whom Putin also complained of chest pains.' Advertisement 'They are not just talking about Russia being destroyed on the battlefield, they are talking about political, cultural, and all other types of sovereignty with complete pillage. Now they're talking about nuclear blackmail. 'Those who make such statements will be reminded that our country also has various weapons of destruction and with regard to certain components they are even more modern than the NATO ones. 'If there is any threat to the territorial integrity of our country and to protect our people we will certainly use all means available to us. I'm not bluffing. 'Russia citizens can be certain that the territorial integrity of our motherland, our independence and security will be assured. I shall stress - by all means available to us 'And those trying to blackmail us with nuclear weapons should know that the tables can turn on them 'In our historic tradition our people had it in their destiny to stop those how are trying to subjugate our motherland and it will happen now.' The allegations are an almost exact inversion of everything Russia has been accused of doing, and is a common trope of Kremlin propaganda. Referendums will begin this week into next week, according to Russia occupation authorities, with the results expected to be announced shortly after. Police and officials will go door-to-door to ensure people cast their votes, they said, leaving few doubts about which way they will be voting. Ballot boxes will also be set up inside Russia itself, ostensibly to allow those who have already fled those regions a chance to cast a vote - but in all likelihood will be stuffed with fake ballots. Early 'polling' released by Russian state media last night showed - unsurprisingly - that more than 80 per cent of people in the four regions want to join Russia. In Donetsk and Luhansk - the focus of Putin's war effort - the reported figure was over 90 per cent.

White House spokesman Jake Sullivan described the votes as a violation of Ukrainian sovereignty which carry 'no legitimacy'. Emmanuel Macron, speaking at the UN where heads of state are gathered for a general assembly, said that if Moscow's plan 'wasn't so tragic it would be funny.' German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said Putin will only give up his 'imperial ambitions' that risk destroying Ukraine and Russia if he recognises he cannot win the war. 'This is why we will not accept any peace dictated by Russia and this is why Ukraine must be able to fend off Russia's attack,' Scholz said. Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida told the assembly the U.N.'s credibility was in danger because of the invasion by Russia, a permanent member of the Security Council, and reforms of the council were needed. 'Russia's invasion of Ukraine is a conduct that tramples the philosophy and principles of the U.N. charter ... It should never be tolerated,' Kishida said. Ukraine's Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba vowed that: 'The Russians can do whatever they want. It will not change anything. 'Ukraine has every right to liberate its territories and will keep liberating them whatever Russia has to say.' If the referendum plan 'wasn't so tragic it would be funny,' French President Emmanuel Macron told reporters ahead of the U.N. assembly in New York. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said Putin will only give up his 'imperial ambitions' that risk destroying Ukraine and Russia if he recognises he cannot win the war. 'This is why we will not accept any peace dictated by Russia and this is why Ukraine must be able to fend off Russia's attack,' Scholz said in his first address to the General Assembly.

'Russia's invasion of Ukraine is a conduct that tramples the philosophy and principles of the U.N. charter ... It should never be tolerated,' Kishida said. 'The situation on at the front clearly indicates the initiative is with Ukraine,' Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said in a video address released early on Wednesday. Ukraine's position did not change because of 'some noise' from Russia, Zelensky added in a reference to the referendums. Advertisement Russia is now almost seven months into what was intended to be a days-long war in Ukraine, and the situation for its troops is becoming increasingly desperate. Having been forced to retreat from Kyiv in the early months of fighting after its advance stalled, the Kremlin's war machine instead focused its efforts on 'liberating' the eastern Donbas region. Months of grinding warfare saw Russia capture the whole of the Luhansk region, but only around half of neighbouring Donetsk - which make up the Donbas. As Russia's advances slowed and then stopped, Ukraine went on the counter-attack - launching an offensive on the southern city of Kherson. Russia moved forces from other areas of the country to help defend the city, at which point Ukraine launched a second counter-attack east out of Kharkiv - in the north. That move caught the Kremlin's commanders completely off guard, triggering a rout that handed 3,000 square miles of territory that Russia had spent months capturing back to Ukraine in just a few days. And Kyiv has continued to press the attack, regaining a foothold in the Luhansk region and threatening to push further across the province. Faced with war on two fronts and not enough men to hold the territory he has already captured, Putin was left with few options but to begin conscripting men. However, experts and analysts say it will do little to turn the tide of the war in his favour. It will take at least weeks, possibly months, to gather, equip, train and transport hundreds of thousands more men to the frontlines - time that Russia does not have. By the time reinforcements arrive winter will be setting in when combat operations will be considerably harder, compounding the issues that Russia's military already faces. And mobilising more men will do nothing to solve the chronic lack of equipment and supplies among Russia's ranks, or fix the logistical issues which have hampered its attacks. Some drew comparisons with the disastrous Winter War that the Soviet Union fought against Finland, which ended with hundreds of thousands of Red Army troops dead or wounded to around 25,000 Finnish. Western leaders had pre-empted Putin's remarks at the UN last night, saying they would not recognise the results of any 'sham' referendums in Ukraine. 'The Russians can do whatever they want. It will not change anything,' Ukraine's Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said on Tuesday as world leaders were arriving for the United Nations General Assembly meeting. He later doubled down on the issue, tweeting: 'Sham 'referendums' will not change anything. Neither will any hybrid 'mobilization.' 'Russia has been and remains an aggressor illegally occupying parts of Ukrainian land. Ukraine has every right to liberate its territories and will keep liberating them whatever Russia has to say.' French President Emmanuel Macron said that if the referendum plan 'wasn't so tragic it would be funny.' He described Russia's invasion as 'a return to a new age of imperialism and colonies' and warned that inaction risked 'tearing down the global order without which peace is not possible.' 'It's not a matter of choosing one side between East and West, or North or South. It's a matter of responsibility' to the UN Charter, he said. Putin lashed out at the free world after his military suffered a humiliating rout near Kharkiv last week that handed a swathe of territory back to Ukraine (pictured, destroyed Russian tanks) Russia is increasingly resorting to desperate moves to hold on to the territory it has seized in Ukraine, including the apparent use of incendiary weapons (pictured) Meanwhile, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said the world was 'facing a new fragmentation' after years of hope following the end of the Cold War and his own nation's reunification. Chancellor Olaf Scholz said the world was 'facing a new fragmentation' after years of hope following the end of the Cold War and his own nation's reunification. Scholz said that President Vladimir Putin, who invaded Ukraine in February, will 'only give up his war and his imperialist ambitions if he realizes he cannot win.' 'We stand firmly at the side of those under attack — for the protection of the lives and the freedom of the Ukrainians, and for the protection of our international order,' he said. And Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida told the assembly the U.N.'s credibility was in danger because of the invasion by Russia, a permanent member of the Security Council. 'Russia's invasion of Ukraine is a conduct that tramples the philosophy and principles of the U.N. charter ... It should never be tolerated,' Kishida said. President Joe Biden will make an address to the UN today in which he will argue that Russia's 'naked aggression' in Ukraine is an affront to the heart of what the international body stands for. White House officials said the focus of his time at the general assembly will be rallying Ukraine allies to stay the course against Russia, and remain united in the face of Putin's threats. 'He'll offer a firm rebuke of Russia's unjust war in Ukraine and make a call to the world to continue to stand against the naked aggression that we've seen these past several months,' White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan said in previewing the president's address. 'He will underscore the importance of strengthening the United Nations and reaffirm core tenets of its charter at a time when a permanent member of the Security Council has struck at the very heart of the charter by challenging the principle of territorial integrity and sovereignty.' In his nightly address Zelenskyy said there were lots of questions surrounding the announcements but stressed that they would not change Ukraine's commitment to retake areas occupied by Russian forces. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky addressed world leaders at the UN last night, thanking Western leaders for condemning Russia's plans to break away parts of his country Emmanuel Macron was among leaders to address the UN on Ukraine last night, accusing Putin of trying to 'return to an age of imperialism and colonies' 'The situation on the front line clearly indicates that the initiative belongs to Ukraine,' he said. 'Our positions do not change because of the noise or any announcements somewhere. And we enjoy the full support of our partners in this. 'I thank all friends and partners of Ukraine for today's mass principled firm condemnation of Russia's attempts to stage new sham referenda,' Zelensky said. In another signal that Russia is digging in for a protracted and ramped-up conflict, the Kremlin-controlled lower of house of parliament voted Tuesday to toughen laws against desertion, surrender and looting by Russian troops. Lawmakers also voted to introduce possible 10-year prison terms for soldiers refusing to fight. If approved, as expected, by the upper house and then signed by Putin, the legislation would strengthen commanders' hands against failing morale reported among soldiers. In the Russian-occupied city of Enerhodar, shelling continued around Europe's largest nuclear power plant. Ukrainian energy operator Energoatom said Russian shelling again damaged infrastructure at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant and briefly forced workers to start two diesel generators for emergency power to reactor cooling pumps. Such pumps are essential for avoiding a meltdown at a nuclear facility even though all six of the plant's reactors have been shut down. Energoatom said the generators were later switched off as main power weas restored. The Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant has been a focus for concern for months because of fears that shelling could lead to a radiation leak. Russia and Ukraine blame each other for the shelling.""]"
6,122,6_hong_kong_hong kong_china,"['hong', 'kong', 'hong kong', 'china', 'chinese', 'beijing', 'law', 'chinas', 'national', 'security']","[""Hong Kong's freedoms were declared dead today after China's parliament rubber-stamped a new security law to give Beijing sweeping powers over the city, sparking global outrage. The bill gives the Communist Party draconian powers to punish 'secession, subversion, terrorism and foreign interference' and allows its secret police to operate openly in Hong Kong. Chinese president Xi Jinping cast one of the 2,878 votes for the bill - with only one against - in a move which has triggered a fresh wave of protests in the city despite Beijing's promise to 'smash' any resistance. Lawmakers in the city mourned 'the end of Hong Kong' today and said the former British colony 'just becomes another Chinese city' under Beijing's authoritarian control. Washington said the move would 'fundamentally undermine Hong Kong's high degree of autonomy and freedoms' which were promised when it returned to Chinese rule under a 'one country, two systems' formula in 1997. US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo yesterday said Hong Kong no longer qualified for special treatment under US law, potentially dealing a crushing blow to its status as a major financial hub. Japan has also voiced concern while UK ministers are facing calls to take 'immediate action'. Taiwan accused China of 'shattering' the city's freedom, offering Hong Kong residents the chance to escape Beijing's rule by moving to Taiwan under a plan for 'humanitarian assistance'. Meanwhile, riot police were deployed across Hong Kong today after mass protests as lawmakers debated a bill that would criminalise disrespect of China's national anthem. Chinese leader Xi Jinping pushes a button to vote on the new national security law for Hong Kong, which critics say will destroy the autonomy of the former British colony today China's Communist Party leaders and delegates sit at the opening of the National People's Congress in Beijing as the country's parliament voted to impose a new security law on Hong Kong The National People's Congress voted 2,878 to 1 in favour of the decision to empower its standing committee to draft the Hong Kong national security legislation, with six abstentions A scuffle broke out at a session of Hong Kong's Legislative Council which was debating a separate measure criminalising any abuse or insults of the Chinese national anthem Pro-democracy supporters are pictured scuffling with riot police during an detention at a rally in Causeway Bay district on Wednesday. The national anthem and national security bills have re-ignited the anti-government unrest which started in June last year in the Asian financial hub The security law was 'only the latest in a series of actions undermining Hong Kong freedoms, Pompeo told Congress. 'No reasonable person can assert today that Hong Kong maintains a high degree of autonomy from China, given facts on the ground,' he said. Beijing reacted angrily to Pompeo's move, saying the decision to revoke Hong Kong's special status 'is the most barbaric, the most unreasonable and the most shameless'. In a further response today, the governments of the US, UK, Australia and Canada said China's move was 'in direct conflict with its international obligations'. Direct rule from Beijing 'would curtail the Hong Kong people's liberties, and in doing so, dramatically erode Hong Kong's autonomy and the system that made it so prosperous,' a joint statement said. 'We are also extremely concerned that this action will exacerbate the existing deep divisions in Hong Kong society; the law does nothing to build mutual understanding and foster reconciliation within Hong Kong. 'Rebuilding trust across Hong Kong society by allowing the people of Hong Kong to enjoy the rights and freedoms they were promised can be the only way back from the tensions and unrest that the territory has seen over the last year.' 'The world’s focus on a global pandemic requires enhanced trust in governments and international cooperation. Beijing’s unprecedented move risks having the opposite effect.' China says the law was necessary because Hong Kong has become a 'national security risk' following years of anti-Beijing demonstrations. Chinese authorities and the Beijing-backed government in Hong Kong say there is no threat to the city's high degree of autonomy and the new security law would be tightly focused. Premier Li Keqiang said lawmakers had 'passed the decision to maintain national security, and it represents the steady and lasting [execution of] one country, two systems, and the safeguard of the long-term prosperity and stability of Hong Kong.' But the move prompted immediate warnings that the law would be used to persecute protesters, and China could bring charges of subversion and terrorism against them. The Chinese National People's Congress passed the national security law for Hong Kong unanimously at its closing ceremony in Beijing on Thursday.

Pictured, police stand guard on a road to deter pro-democracy protesters from blocking roads in Mong Kok Riot police stand guard outside a Louis Vuitton shop during a protest against Beijing's plans to impose national security legislation in Hong Kong on Thursday. The bill has been approved The move will ultimately change the territory's mini-constitution, or Basic Law, adding a national security law with full details to be decided later by Chinese leaders - bypassing Hong Kong's legislature. Critics say the act would lead to the widespread use of secret police, arbitrary detentions, surveillance and even control over the internet on the island territory. The new law could see Chinese intelligence agencies set up bases in the city, which was promised in 1997 that its freedoms would remain unchanged for 50 years. Those liberties included a free market economy, an independent judiciary, free speech and a local legislature. 'It's the end of Hong Kong... they are cutting off our souls, taking away the values which we've always embraced, values like human rights, democracy, rule of law,' said Hong Kong lawmaker Claudia Mo. Emily Lau, a former chair of the city's Democratic Party, said Beijing could send authorities to Hong Kong to set up their own 'national security office' and impose the mainland's laws. 'One country, two systems is over. It's one country, one system,' she told Sky News today, urging Boris Johnson to speak out 'however busy he is' with the pandemic. The Human Rights Foundation said the Chinese Communist Party had 'signed a death sentence' for Hong Kong's autonomy. Hong Kong's unpopular pro-Beijing leader Carrie Lam has said the law will not stifle freedoms, claiming it showed 'the country's care towards Hong Kong'. 'It will not affect the legitimate rights and freedoms enjoyed by Hong Kong residents,' she said, adding that the new powers were there to 'sanction an extremely small minority of criminals who threaten national security'. 'A stable and safe society will provide a favourable business and investment environment. This will help better Hong Kong’s development down the road,' she said. The Chinese National People's Congress passed the Hong Kong bill at its closing ceremony in Beijing this afternoon local time. The law is expected to be enacted before September. The National People's Congress voted 2,878 to 1 in favour of the decision to empower its standing committee to draft the legislation, with six abstentions. The legislators gathered in the Great Hall of the People burst into sustained applause when the vote tally was projected onto screens. A Hong Kong protester gestures 'five demands' while attending a rally in a shopping mall today Riot police were deployed across Hong Kong today after mass protests yesterday as lawmakers debated a bill that would criminalise disrespect of China's national anthem A man smokes past a line of riot police in Hong Kong during the second day of debate on a contentious bill that would criminalise insulting or abusing the Chinese national anthem Police fired pepper pellets and made 360 arrests on Wednesday as thousands took to the streets in anger over the anthem bill and national security legislation proposed by China that has raised international alarm over freedoms in the city. On Thursday, dozens gathered in a shopping mall, chanting 'good kids don't become cops,' and 'reclaim Hong Kong' as the Hong Kong's parliament continued to debate over the bill - the latest spark of anti-government unrest in the semi-autonomous city. Meanwhile three pro-democracy lawmakers were ejected from Hong Kong's legislative chamber this morning, disrupting debate on a bill that would criminalise insulting or abusing the Chinese national anthem. 'We have wanted to use any method to stop this national anthem law getting passed by this legislature, which is basically controlled by the Chinese Communist Party, because the law is just another way of putting pressure on Hong Kong people,' one of the ejected lawmakers, Eddie Chu, said outside the chamber. Protests raged in Hong Kong for months last year over plans for a separate law which would have allowed Hong Kong residents to be extradited to the mainland. The protests were spearheaded by young people, who will see China's 50-year promise of freedom expire in their lifetimes. Nearly 23 of those 50 years have already passed. The angry protests have subsided during the coronavirus pandemic, which first emerged in China, but the new bill has seen the first major demonstrations for months. China's troops have said that they are ready to 'smash' any protests against the bill. The Chinese Ministry of Foreign affairs said on Wednesday that China would take necessary countermeasures to foreign interference regarding the new legislation.

The United States and China clashed over Hong Kong at the United Nations on Wednesday after Beijing opposed a request by Washington for the Security Council to meet over the national security legislation. The US mission said it was 'a matter of urgent global concern that implicates international peace and security'. China said the legislation was an internal matter. The loss of Hong Kong's trade privileges could mean Hong Kong identity card holders might lose their ability to visit the United States without applying for a visa in advance. Washington also could revoke its promise to exchange Hong Kong dollars for U.S dollars, potentially disrupting the city's financial system, Deutsche Bank economist Michael Spencer said in a report. The New York Times reported that Trump administration officials were preparing to cancel the visas of thousands of Chinese students who are linked to the People's Liberation Army. Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden would also sanction China if he is elected in November, his campaign said, accusing Trump of having 'enabled' Beijing's curbs on Hong Kong freedom. If Washington opts for hardline measures it would risk 'all of the financial connectivity that China has to the free market', according to Robert Spalding, a US-China expert at the Hudson Institute. The two countries are locked in a number of other disputes, a row over Chinese telecommunications firm Huawei and a fierce dispute over Beijing's handling of the virus outbreak. Meanwhile, Taiwan promised to settle any Hong Kong people who flee for political reasons, offering help from employment to counselling. Hong Kong's demonstrators have won widespread sympathy in Taiwan, which China considers as its rightful territory. 'The decision to impose national security legislation on Hong Kong shatters China's solemn promise in 1997 to respect Hong Kong's autonomy and freedoms,' Taiwan's foreign ministry said. 'Taiwan will be ready to offer necessary humanitarian assistance.' Lord Chris Patten, the last British governor of Hong Kong, has called on world leaders to stand up to Beijing and help Hong Kong fight for its freedom. Lord Patten has also described the new law as 'a frontal assault' on the relative freedoms granted to the semi-autonomous city Prince Charles and the last British Governor of Hong Kong Chris Patten (left) raise their glasses for the loyal toast prior to the colony's handover to China after 154 years of British rule Meanwhile Lord Chris Patten, the last British governor of Hong Kong, has called on world leaders to stand up to Beijing and help Hong Kong fight for its freedom in a column on the Financial Times. Lord Patten has also described the new law as 'a frontal assault' on the relative freedoms granted to the semi-autonomous city. He said Britain must act over the 'disgraceful breach' of China's international treaty obligations, and branded the Communist Party 'a very nasty, brutal, bullying and mendacious regime'. China blocked a UN Security Council meeting to discuss the legislation on Wednesday. Ambassador Zhang Jun said Hong Kong matters are 'purely China's internal affairs.' Labour's shadow foreign secretary Lisa Nandy today demanded 'immediate action' from Britain to 'ensure we defend the values of democracy, freedom and the rule of law'. 'As the world searches for a global response to Covid-19, defending the rule of law, democracy and freedom of expression here and across the world is more important than ever,' she told foreign secretary Dominic Raab. 'I am deeply concerned that in the absence of any strategic approach, China will continue to act with impunity with very stark consequences for people in Hong Kong and elsewhere,' she said. Japan said today it was 'seriously concerned' about the Chinese parliament's decision, describing Hong Kong as an 'extremely important partner'. 'It is the long-standing policy of Japan to attach great importance to upholding a free and open system which has been enjoying and the democratic and stable development of Hong Kong,' a statement said."", ""China's 'unacceptable' crackdown in Hong Kong could shut the door to Huawei's involvement in Britain's 5G mobile network, Boris Johnson has said as London and Beijing traded blows today. Mr Johnson said the draconian new security law that China has imposed on Hong Kong was 'plainly an unacceptable breach' of the freedoms that the city was guaranteed after Britain handed it back in 1997. Linking the crisis to the Huawei deal, the PM told the Evening Standard that 'I don't want to see our critical national infrastructure at risk of being in any way controlled by potentially hostile state vendors... so we have to think very carefully about how to proceed now.' Q&A on Hong Kong's British Nationals Overseas (BNOs) What is a British National (overseas)? Hong Kongers could register for this special status before the 1997 handover. They get a UK passport but no automatic right to live and work in the UK. You cannot apply to become a BNO. How many of them are there? As of February, there were 349,881 BNO passport holders. The Government estimates that there are around 2.9million BNOs currently in Hong Kong. What is Britain offering them? A path to citizenship. BNOs will get five years 'limited leave to remain'. They can then apply for 'settled status'. After 12 months with settled status, they can apply for citizenship. Their close family will also be eligible. Advertisement Mr Johnson has been under massive pressure to change course on Huawei after agreeing in January to give the Chinese tech giant a 'limited' role in the 5G network, despite fears that Beijing would use it for espionage. Since then, the coronavirus pandemic and the chaos in Hong Kong have thrown Britain's relations with China into crisis - with Beijing now threatening to punish the UK for offering refuge to Hong Kongers. Hundreds were arrested in a crackdown on Hong Kong protesters yesterday just hours after the new law came into force, bringing in long prison sentences for dissent and trials run by the mainland Communist Party. Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab yesterday unveiled plans to offer residency and a possible route to citizenship to British Nationals (Overseas), a group of nearly three million people with links to Hong Kong. But Beijing regards them as Chinese nationals and its embassy in London warned today that 'we firmly oppose this and reserve the right to take corresponding measures'. Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian told a press conference today that 'the UK should bear any consequences caused by this... Hong Kong matters are China's domestic affairs, and no countries have any right to intervene.' Mr Raab admitted last night that there would be little the UK could do if China tried to stop Hong Kongers from leaving. China did not say how it might retaliate, but it has recently hit Australia with a series of tariffs, export bans and warnings against travelling and studying in the country after it led global calls for an inquiry into coronavirus. Australia said today it is considering a similar citizenship offer, while Taiwan has opened an office to help Hong Kongers take refuge there. Boris Johnson (pictured at his House of Commons office yesterday) has warned that the Huawei 5G deal could be scuppered by China's crackdown in Hong Kong Riot police officers pin down a protester during a demonstration in Hong Kong yesterday amid anger at Beijing's new security law which could lead to suspects being tried by Communist Party courts on the mainland Protesters march in Hong Kong yesterday in a fresh round of demonstrations which saw hundreds arrested, including some people detained under Beijing's new national security law Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian (pictured) told reporters at a press conference today that 'all the consequences shall be borne by the UK side' after Britain drew up plans to offer residency to three million Hong Kongers Hong Kong police last night arrested a man accused of stabbing a police officer during protests over the new security law (pictured_ - taking him off a Cathay Pacific flight to London moments before it took off Riot police detain a man as they clear protesters taking part in a rally against a new national security law in Hong Kong on July 1, 2020, on the 23rd anniversary of the city's handover from Britain to China Hong Kongers look to take up Britain's offer 'Hundreds of thousands of people' from Hong Kong might come to the UK after the Government offered an escape route to around three million people in the city, says a former British consulate worker who alleged he was tortured in China. Simon Cheng is the first person to have been granted political asylum by the Home Office after he was allegedly shackled and beaten in secret detention in the Chinese city of Shenzhen. Mr Cheng, a British overseas national, announced Wednesday night that his immigration application had been approved last Friday by the British government. The pro-democracy activist, 29, today said that 'hundreds of thousands of people' from Hong Kong might follow his footsteps and choose to come to the UK. The former consulate worker was detained in China for over two weeks last August after Beijing accused the former consulate worker of inciting unrest amid mass anti-government demonstrations in Hong Kong. Simon Cheng (pictured) is the first person to have been granted political asylum by the Home Office in relation to China's crackdown on the Hong Kong anti-government movement after he was allegedly shackled, beaten, forced to stand for long hours in secret detention in China Eunice Wong, a Hong Kong student who has just finished her Master's degree in the UK, said she would be taking advantage of the offer. 'It's the only option. I don't think I can go back home now. I will be persecuted,' she told The Times. In a separate interview with BBC Radio 5 Live, Ms Wong said she would not be able to go home again after talking to foreign media. Thousands of Hong Kong citizens have already expressed their desire to move to Britain on social media platforms. A Facebook group named the 'Official Group for BNO Equality Movement' has seen nearly 3,000 new members in the past month. Numerous Hong Kong websites have published articles explaining the process of applying for the new BNO rights, including one titled 'Things you must know before immigration'. Advertisement The PM is under pressure on Huawei from all sides, with Tory backbenchers repeatedly bringing up the issue in yesterday's Commons debate on Hong Kong. Tom Tugendhat, the chairman of the Foreign Affairs Select Committee, also raised concerns about China's influence on the UK university sector - citing claims that 'Chinese students have already been influenced to silence debate and change outcomes here in the UK'. Labour has also called for Britain to 'develop home grown alternatives' to Chinese technology and make 'a proper assessment of the national security implications' before green-lighting the Huawei deal. Mr Raab told MPs that Huawei's role was currently 'under review' by the National Cyber Security Centre, with ministers no longer sticking by the January deal to let Huawei into 35 per cent of the network and none of its 'core' elements. Unveiling the offer to Hong Kongers, Mr Raab said the 'bespoke' new arrangement to be implemented in the coming months would grant BNOs five years' limited leave to remain in the UK with the ability to live and work. They would then be eligible to apply for settled status and would be able to apply for citizenship after 12 months with that status. At the moment, BNOs can travel on a British passport and receive UK diplomatic help but do not have the automatic right to live or work in Britain. The status had to be acquired before 1997 and can no longer be applied for, although 'dependents' of BNO holders will be eligible under the scheme. As of February, there were nearly 350,000 BNO passport holders, while the Government estimates there are around 2.9million BNOs living in Hong Kong. 'This is a special, bespoke set of arrangements developed for the unique circumstances we face and in the light of our historic commitment to the people of Hong Kong,' Mr Raab said. However, the Foreign Secretary later said 'only a proportion' would be likely to take up the new status. He also said that if Beijing tried to stop people with British National (Overseas) status from leaving Hong Kong, there would be little that could be done by the UK. Mr Raab told ITV's Peston programme: 'There is diplomatic leverage, there are other ways that we can persuade China not to fully implement either the national security law or some of the reprisals you talk about. 'But ultimately we need to be honest that we wouldn't be able to force China to allow BNOs to come to the UK.' The Chinese embassy in London insists that 'all Chinese compatriots residing in Hong Kong are Chinese nationals'. 'If the British side makes unilateral changes to the relevant practice, it will breach its own position and pledges as well as international law and basic norms governing international relations,' it said in a statement. 'We firmly oppose this and reserve the right to take corresponding measures,' it said without elaborating.

HUAWEI AND 5G Beijing has been angered by Western fears that Chinese tech giant Huawei could be used as a front for Communist Party espionage. Huawei has long been lobbying to help build Britain's 5G mobile network, but some politicians fear that Beijing could commandeer the technology to tap into communications. China has previously accused UK ministers of showing 'deep-rooted pride and prejudice' by raising fears about Huawei's involvement. Huawei denies any spying link. In January 2020, Huawei was granted a limited role in the 5G network after the government said it could manage the risks and would keep Huawei out of the 'core' of the network, limiting its role to 35 per cent. But US pressure has prompted a rethink in recent weeks. Ministers admitted this week that US sanctions are 'likely to have an impact on the viability of Huawei as a provider'. Britain is now studying ways it can cut Huawei out of its system entirely and build up an alliance of European and Asian providers that reduces China's dominance in the field. CORONAVIRUS CRISIS UK ministers have said that China faces a 'reckoning' over its handling of the coronavirus crisis, which started in Wuhan late last year and has killed more than 40,000 people in Britain. Defence Secretary Ben Wallace said in May that China has questions to answer about how the disease was allowed to spiral out of control, amid claims that China covered up the outbreak in its earliest days. Britain was among the countries to back Australia's calls for a WHO investigation into the pandemic. China has responded to Australia's pressure with a series of retaliatory measures. China's state-run Global Times stoked further tension in May by saying the UK's response to Covid-19 was 'flippant and ill-prepared' and saying the UK needed a 'miracle' to escape the 'mess' it was in. HUMAN RIGHTS Britain voiced concern about the crackdown in Hong Kong during last year's protests, saying that mass arrests and the use of live ammunition risked 'inflaming tensions'. In addition, Britain was one of 23 countries to voice alarm about Chinese human rights abuses in Xinjiang, where ethnic minority Uighurs have allegedly been detained in 're-education camps'. A joint statement signed by Britain said there were 'credible reports of mass detention; efforts to restrict cultural and religious practices; mass surveillance disproportionately targeting ethnic Uighurs; and other human rights violations and abuses'. Britain also urged China to give 'meaningful access' to UN investigators to assess the situation in Xinjiang. INFLUENCE ON BRITAIN'S ELITE A London club packed with political and business elites was caught in a row last month after a book claimed it was being used by China to 'groom' Britain's elites. The pro-China 48 Group Club, which lists Lord Heseltine among its patrons, is taking legal action over the book which suggested that China sees the club as a channel for its lobbying efforts. The club denied being a 'vehicle for Beijing' and said it was an 'independent body' promoting 'positive Sino-British relations', The Times reported. Experts have previously warned about Chinese tactics of 'elite capture' by appointing prominent foreigners as well-paid advisers and making them 'more amenable to Communist Party aims'. Advertisement Separately, foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian warned at a daily briefing today that Britain would bear all consequences for any actions it took over Hong Kong. 'All Chinese compatriots in Hong Kong, including those holding the British National (Overseas) passports, are Chinese citizens,' Zhao said. 'Before Hong Kong returned, the UK side had clearly promised not to provide the right of abode in Britain for holders of the BNO travel documents. The UK side has ignored the Chinese side's solemn position and insisted on changing the policy to provide a route for the relevant individuals to stay in the UK and obtain UK citizenship. '[The UK's move] has seriously breached its own promises and violates international law and the basic principles of international relations. The Chinese side strongly condemns this and reserves the rights of further reactions. The UK should bear any consequences caused by this.' Zhao said no amount of pressure from external forces could 'shake China's determination and will to safeguard national sovereignty and Hong Kong's prosperity and stability', also criticising a US move towards sanctions. Hu Xijin, the editor of the state-run Global Times, struck a different tone by saying that Britain should either grant citizenship immediately or not at all. 'Johnson government should give Hong Kong BNO passport holders UK citizenship, rather than let them go through a long period of uncertainty,' he said. 'No matter what's China's official response, Chinese people have no objection to UK opening its arms to Hongkongers who want to leave.' Britain regards the new security law as a breach of the 1984 treaty which agreed the terms of the handover - but China regards it as a historical document with no validity today. China unveiled the details of the security law on Tuesday night after weeks of uncertainty, pushing one of the world's most glittering financial hubs on to a more authoritarian path. Article 38 of the law even appears to claim jurisdiction over 'every person on the planet' for supposed national security crimes committed overseas. Hong Kong returned to China in 1997 under a deal known as 'one country, two systems' which maintained rights such as free speech and an independent judiciary that are unknown on the mainland. Beijing promised to preserve the city's way of life until at least 2047- but critics say its special status is now dead. Hong Kong police began their new crackdown on dissent yesterday, boasting of their draconian new powers as they rounded up hundreds of pro-democracy activists including a 15-year-old girl waving an independence flag. Police used water cannons, tear gas and pepper spray to drive protesters back on the 23rd anniversary of the former British colony's return to Chinese rule. Three were injured when a man flying a Hong Kong independence flag rammed his motorbike into a group of officers. Ten people were specifically arrested under the new security law, which lines up long prison sentences for crimes of 'subversion' and 'terrorism' which critics fear could be used to silence dissent. Around 370 were arrested on other charges, including unlawful assembly and possessing weapons. Police said that one officer was stabbed in the arm by 'rioters holding sharp objects'. They added that the suspects fled and bystanders offered no help. Authorities later arrested a 24-year-old man at the city's airport in the early hours of Thursday on suspicion of attacking and wounding an officer during protests. A police spokesman said the arrested man was surnamed Wong but could not confirm if he was leaving Hong Kong or working at the airport. Wong had purchased a ticket on Wednesday and boarded the flight with no check-in luggage, the official said. He did not respond to the air crew who called him by name, and was not at his designated seat. Police identified him after conducting a sweep of the plane. Local media reported he was arrested after a relative tipped off police about his his travel plans.

The writing that read ‘Arise! All those who don’t want to be slaves!’ was spotted Wednesday on the street of Hong Kong. It was revealed after a picture of the graffiti was shared on Twitter by Luke de Pulford, a local human rights activist. Hong Kong protesters have sprayed a graffiti (pictured( quoting lyrics from the Chinese national anthem to urge the city to rise up against Beijing’s crackdown on freedoms The quote came from China’s national anthem, ‘March of the Volunteers’ which refers to several volunteer armies that opposed Japan's invasion of Manchuria in the 1930s. Composed by playwright Tian Han in 1934, the song was initially adopted as a provisional anthem in 1949 by the Communist government. When Tian was imprisoned during the Cultural Revolution in the 1960s, the song was briefly and unofficially replaced by 'The East is Red'. It was restored and became the official Chinese national anthem in 1982. The song also became the national anthem for Hong Kong and Macau following their handovers to China in 1997 and 1999, respectively. Advertisement The new law is seen as Beijing's boldest step yet to bring the semi-autonomous territory under control of the authoritarian mainland. Campaigners say the 'one country, two systems' formula which was meant to guarantee Hong Kong's freedoms until 2047 is now dead - but China insists the law is an internal affair targeting only a handful of 'troublemakers'. The law also allows China's feared security agencies to openly set up shop in Hong Kong for the first time, and could open the door for dissidents to be tried on the mainland. An influential group of barristers says the law will weaken the independent judiciary which is seen as key to Hong Kong's success as a business hub. Brought in following anti-government protests last year, it outlaws any action deemed to be against the national interest of China. Anyone shouting slogans or holding flags calling for independence is violating the law, regardless of whether violence is used. Even driving a bus full of protesters could be deemed illegal. The most serious offenders will be labelled 'terrorists', transferred to the mainland and receive a maximum sentence of life in jail. One example of a terror act, for example, is attacking public transport, something protesters often did last year. But it also includes providing support or assistance for such acts. 'This would mean many 'moderate' or peaceful supporters of the protest movement would be caught under the law if the extreme protesters they assisted were to be arrested as terrorists,' Hong Kong lawyer Antony Dapiran said. Some trials will be held behind closed doors. A new police unit unaccountable to local laws has also been given licence to operate in the territory. Beijing, not Hong Kong, will have power over how the law is interpreted. Ahead of the protest, pro-democracy activist Tsang Kin-shing, of the League of Social Democrats, warned there was a 'large chance of our being arrested'. He said: 'The charges will not be light, please judge for yourself.' A man who gave his name as Seth, 35, said: 'I'm scared of going to jail but for justice I have to come out today, I have to stand up.' Media tycoon Jimmy Lai said the law meant Hong Kong was 'dead'. He added: 'It's worse than the worst scenario imagined. Hong Kong is totally subdued, totally under control.' Mr Lai, 72, who also supported the Tiananmen Square protesters in 1989, thinks Beijing will come for him but is unfazed. 'I cannot worry, because you never know what kind of measures they will take against me,' he said.

In a scathing critique, the city's Bar Association said the new law dismantles the legal firewall between Hong Kong's independent judiciary - which is seen as crucial to the city's success as a business hub - and China's Communist Party-controlled courts. The Association said the new national security offences were 'widely drawn' and 'are capable of being applied in a manner that is arbitrary, and that disproportionately interferes with fundamental rights, including the freedom of conscience, expression and assembly'. 'Lawyers, judges, police and Hong Kong residents were given no opportunity to familiarise themselves with the contents of the new law, including the serious criminal offences it creates, before it came into force,' it said. Barristers said the law makes clear 'suspects can be removed to face trial in Mainland China' and points out that the process does not have the usual checks and balances of extradition hearings. It noted the law allowed mainland security agents working in Hong Kong to be 'above the reach of local law' and said empowering the city's chief executive to appoint judges to oversee national security cases undermined judicial independence. In response, China dismissed the statement as 'unfounded', claiming officials had held dialogue sessions with Hong Kong residents to hear their opinions on the law. 'The lawyers' association's claim... that the law lacked meaningful consultation is totally unfounded,' said foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian. Advertisement Hong Kong's Beijing-backed leader Carrie Lam strongly endorsed the new law in her speech marking the 23rd anniversary of the handover yesterday. 'This decision was necessary and timely to maintain Hong Kong's stability,' Lam said following a flag-raising ceremony and the playing of China's national anthem. Speaking at the harbour-front venue where the last British governor Chris Patten handed Hong Kong back to Chinese rule, Lam described it as the most important development in the 23 years since then. Mr Raab yesterday rebuked HSBC for supporting the new law, saying that the rights of Hong Kong should not be 'sacrificed on the altar of bankers' bonuses'. HSBC was originally known as the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation. British banking giants HSBC and Standard Chartered - both with a major presence in Hong Kong and on the mainland - joined other firms in publicly backing the law last month. The Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce described the passing of the law earlier this week as 'instrumental in helping to restore stability and certainty to Hong Kong, which has been severely impacted by the social unrest since last year'. 'We need a stable environment which the (security law) aims to provide.' Analysts and members of the business community have said the law could add to the risk and complexity of doing business in Hong Kong, but is unlikely to spark an exodus of foreign firms because the city is still seen as the gateway to the Chinese economy. The city's Bar Association, an influential group of barristers, said the new law dismantles the legal firewall between Hong Kong's independent judiciary - which is seen as crucial to the city's success as a business hub - and China's Communist Party-controlled courts. Hong Kong restaurant is raided by police for displaying pro-democracy posters A noodle restaurant in Hong Kong has been forced to shut down after police raided the eatery for displaying pro-democracy slogans, pamphlets and figurines. The owner of 'Bowl and Plate', Gordon Lam, announced the store closure today on Facebook after being warned by the authorities that the restaurant's decorations might breach the new national security law. The post was accompanied by pictures of Mr Lam tearing down the slogans that were put up six months ago to show support of the ongoing anti-government protests in the city.

Many customers have left supportive comments under Mr Lam's post. One commenter wrote: 'They can't tear them down. They are in our hearts.' Another one read: 'The most important thing is that you're safe. We will help you once the business is reopened. One bowl...I'll eat a few more bowls!' Advertisement The Association said the new national security offences were 'widely drawn' and 'are capable of being applied in a manner that is arbitrary, and that disproportionately interferes with fundamental rights, including the freedom of conscience, expression and assembly'. 'Lawyers, judges, police and Hong Kong residents were given no opportunity to familiarise themselves with the contents of the new law, including the serious criminal offences it creates, before it came into force,' it said. China's move has provoked a backlash around the world. The US House of Representatives last night agreed unanimously to seek tough sanctions on Chinese officials and Hong Kong police. On Thursday, Australian leader Scott Morrison said he was 'very actively' considering offering Hong Kongers safe haven. Taiwan has opened an office to help Hong Kongers wanting to flee, while a proposed bill in the United States offering sanctuary to city residents has received widespread bipartisan support. China routinely dismisses all such criticism as interference in its domestic affairs. One of the crimes in the Hong Kong security law explicitly outlaws receiving funding or support from overseas to disrupt lawmaking in Hong Kong or impose sanctions on the city. Amnesty International said the new law was a 'far-reaching threat to Hong Kong's freedoms'. Its Asia-Pacific regional director, Nicholas Bequelin, added: 'With its vague language and provisions for secret trials, hand-picked judges and mainland security agencies operating freely in the city, the law is wide open to politically motivated, capricious and arbitrary interpretation by the authorities. 'Hong Kongers are facing an assault by the Beijing authorities and the Hong Kong government on freedoms that they have long enjoyed.' One major cause of alarm is Article 38 of the law which purports to claim jurisdiction over national security offences committed overseas, even by foreigners. 'If you've ever said anything that might offend [China] or Hong Kong authorities, stay out of Hong Kong,' Donald Clarke, an expert on Chinese law at George Washington University, wrote in an analysis. 'I know of no reason not to think it means what it appears to say: it is asserting extraterritorial jurisdiction over every person on the planet,' Clarke wrote. The UK updated its travel advice on Hong Kong, saying there is an 'increased risk of detention and deportation'. It advised Britons to 'avoid protests and demonstrations.' Political leaders across the spectrum have condemned China's crackdown, which came quicker than anyone expected. But Rod Wye, of the Chatham House think-tank, said Beijing will not care as it takes advantage of global instability and rifts opening up between Western powers. 'The USA and EU are moving in different directions in many areas. It is perhaps to China's advantage that that should be so,' he said.'Expressions of concern are certainly not going to change the Chinese intention one little bit.'

Mr Johnson said the draconian new security law that China has imposed on Hong Kong was 'plainly an unacceptable breach' of the freedoms that the city was guaranteed after Britain handed it back in 1997. Linking the crisis to the Huawei deal, the PM told the Evening Standard that 'I don't want to see our critical national infrastructure at risk of being in any way controlled by potentially hostile state vendors... so we have to think very carefully about how to proceed now.' Q&A on Hong Kong's British Nationals Overseas (BNOs) What is a British National (overseas)? Hong Kongers could register for this special status before the 1997 handover. They get a UK passport but no automatic right to live and work in the UK. You cannot apply to become a BNO. How many of them are there? As of February, there were 349,881 BNO passport holders. The Government estimates that there are around 2.9million BNOs currently in Hong Kong. What is Britain offering them? A path to citizenship. BNOs will get five years 'limited leave to remain'. They can then apply for 'settled status'. After 12 months with settled status, they can apply for citizenship. Their close family will also be eligible. Advertisement Mr Johnson has been under massive pressure to change course on Huawei after agreeing in January to give the Chinese tech giant a 'limited' role in the 5G network, despite fears that Beijing would use it for espionage. Since then, the coronavirus pandemic and the chaos in Hong Kong have thrown Britain's relations with China into crisis - with Beijing now threatening to punish the UK for offering refuge to Hong Kongers. Hundreds were arrested in a crackdown on Hong Kong protesters yesterday just hours after the new law came into force, bringing in long prison sentences for dissent and trials run by the mainland Communist Party. Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab yesterday unveiled plans to offer residency and a possible route to citizenship to British Nationals (Overseas), a group of nearly three million people with links to Hong Kong. But Beijing regards them as Chinese nationals and its embassy in London warned today that 'we firmly oppose this and reserve the right to take corresponding measures'. Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian told a press conference today that 'the UK should bear any consequences caused by this... Hong Kong matters are China's domestic affairs, and no countries have any right to intervene.' Mr Raab admitted last night that there would be little the UK could do if China tried to stop Hong Kongers from leaving. China did not say how it might retaliate, but it has recently hit Australia with a series of tariffs, export bans and warnings against travelling and studying in the country after it led global calls for an inquiry into coronavirus. Australia said today it is considering a similar citizenship offer, while Taiwan has opened an office to help Hong Kongers take refuge there. Boris Johnson (pictured at his House of Commons office yesterday) has warned that the Huawei 5G deal could be scuppered by China's crackdown in Hong Kong Riot police officers pin down a protester during a demonstration in Hong Kong yesterday amid anger at Beijing's new security law which could lead to suspects being tried by Communist Party courts on the mainland Protesters march in Hong Kong yesterday in a fresh round of demonstrations which saw hundreds arrested, including some people detained under Beijing's new national security law Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian (pictured) told reporters at a press conference today that 'all the consequences shall be borne by the UK side' after Britain drew up plans to offer residency to three million Hong Kongers Hong Kong police last night arrested a man accused of stabbing a police officer during protests over the new security law (pictured_ - taking him off a Cathay Pacific flight to London moments before it took off Riot police detain a man as they clear protesters taking part in a rally against a new national security law in Hong Kong on July 1, 2020, on the 23rd anniversary of the city's handover from Britain to China Hong Kongers look to take up Britain's offer 'Hundreds of thousands of people' from Hong Kong might come to the UK after the Government offered an escape route to around three million people in the city, says a former British consulate worker who alleged he was tortured in China. Simon Cheng is the first person to have been granted political asylum by the Home Office after he was allegedly shackled and beaten in secret detention in the Chinese city of Shenzhen. Mr Cheng, a British overseas national, announced Wednesday night that his immigration application had been approved last Friday by the British government. The pro-democracy activist, 29, today said that 'hundreds of thousands of people' from Hong Kong might follow his footsteps and choose to come to the UK. The former consulate worker was detained in China for over two weeks last August after Beijing accused the former consulate worker of inciting unrest amid mass anti-government demonstrations in Hong Kong. Simon Cheng (pictured) is the first person to have been granted political asylum by the Home Office in relation to China's crackdown on the Hong Kong anti-government movement after he was allegedly shackled, beaten, forced to stand for long hours in secret detention in China Eunice Wong, a Hong Kong student who has just finished her Master's degree in the UK, said she would be taking advantage of the offer. 'It's the only option. I don't think I can go back home now. I will be persecuted,' she told The Times. In a separate interview with BBC Radio 5 Live, Ms Wong said she would not be able to go home again after talking to foreign media. Thousands of Hong Kong citizens have already expressed their desire to move to Britain on social media platforms. A Facebook group named the 'Official Group for BNO Equality Movement' has seen nearly 3,000 new members in the past month. Numerous Hong Kong websites have published articles explaining the process of applying for the new BNO rights, including one titled 'Things you must know before immigration'. Advertisement The PM is under pressure on Huawei from all sides, with Tory backbenchers repeatedly bringing up the issue in yesterday's Commons debate on Hong Kong. Tom Tugendhat, the chairman of the Foreign Affairs Select Committee, also raised concerns about China's influence on the UK university sector - citing claims that 'Chinese students have already been influenced to silence debate and change outcomes here in the UK'. Labour has also called for Britain to 'develop home grown alternatives' to Chinese technology and make 'a proper assessment of the national security implications' before green-lighting the Huawei deal. Mr Raab told MPs that Huawei's role was currently 'under review' by the National Cyber Security Centre, with ministers no longer sticking by the January deal to let Huawei into 35 per cent of the network and none of its 'core' elements. Unveiling the offer to Hong Kongers, Mr Raab said the 'bespoke' new arrangement to be implemented in the coming months would grant BNOs five years' limited leave to remain in the UK with the ability to live and work. They would then be eligible to apply for settled status and would be able to apply for citizenship after 12 months with that status. At the moment, BNOs can travel on a British passport and receive UK diplomatic help but do not have the automatic right to live or work in Britain. The status had to be acquired before 1997 and can no longer be applied for, although 'dependents' of BNO holders will be eligible under the scheme. As of February, there were nearly 350,000 BNO passport holders, while the Government estimates there are around 2.9million BNOs living in Hong Kong. 'This is a special, bespoke set of arrangements developed for the unique circumstances we face and in the light of our historic commitment to the people of Hong Kong,' Mr Raab said. However, the Foreign Secretary later said 'only a proportion' would be likely to take up the new status. He also said that if Beijing tried to stop people with British National (Overseas) status from leaving Hong Kong, there would be little that could be done by the UK. Mr Raab told ITV's Peston programme: 'There is diplomatic leverage, there are other ways that we can persuade China not to fully implement either the national security law or some of the reprisals you talk about. 'But ultimately we need to be honest that we wouldn't be able to force China to allow BNOs to come to the UK.' The Chinese embassy in London insists that 'all Chinese compatriots residing in Hong Kong are Chinese nationals'. 'If the British side makes unilateral changes to the relevant practice, it will breach its own position and pledges as well as international law and basic norms governing international relations,' it said in a statement. 'We firmly oppose this and reserve the right to take corresponding measures,' it said without elaborating.

HUAWEI AND 5G Beijing has been angered by Western fears that Chinese tech giant Huawei could be used as a front for Communist Party espionage. Huawei has long been lobbying to help build Britain's 5G mobile network, but some politicians fear that Beijing could commandeer the technology to tap into communications. China has previously accused UK ministers of showing 'deep-rooted pride and prejudice' by raising fears about Huawei's involvement. Huawei denies any spying link. In January 2020, Huawei was granted a limited role in the 5G network after the government said it could manage the risks and would keep Huawei out of the 'core' of the network, limiting its role to 35 per cent. But US pressure has prompted a rethink in recent weeks. Ministers admitted this week that US sanctions are 'likely to have an impact on the viability of Huawei as a provider'. Britain is now studying ways it can cut Huawei out of its system entirely and build up an alliance of European and Asian providers that reduces China's dominance in the field. CORONAVIRUS CRISIS UK ministers have said that China faces a 'reckoning' over its handling of the coronavirus crisis, which started in Wuhan late last year and has killed more than 40,000 people in Britain. Defence Secretary Ben Wallace said in May that China has questions to answer about how the disease was allowed to spiral out of control, amid claims that China covered up the outbreak in its earliest days. Britain was among the countries to back Australia's calls for a WHO investigation into the pandemic. China has responded to Australia's pressure with a series of retaliatory measures. China's state-run Global Times stoked further tension in May by saying the UK's response to Covid-19 was 'flippant and ill-prepared' and saying the UK needed a 'miracle' to escape the 'mess' it was in. HUMAN RIGHTS Britain voiced concern about the crackdown in Hong Kong during last year's protests, saying that mass arrests and the use of live ammunition risked 'inflaming tensions'. In addition, Britain was one of 23 countries to voice alarm about Chinese human rights abuses in Xinjiang, where ethnic minority Uighurs have allegedly been detained in 're-education camps'. A joint statement signed by Britain said there were 'credible reports of mass detention; efforts to restrict cultural and religious practices; mass surveillance disproportionately targeting ethnic Uighurs; and other human rights violations and abuses'. Britain also urged China to give 'meaningful access' to UN investigators to assess the situation in Xinjiang. INFLUENCE ON BRITAIN'S ELITE A London club packed with political and business elites was caught in a row last month after a book claimed it was being used by China to 'groom' Britain's elites. The pro-China 48 Group Club, which lists Lord Heseltine among its patrons, is taking legal action over the book which suggested that China sees the club as a channel for its lobbying efforts. The club denied being a 'vehicle for Beijing' and said it was an 'independent body' promoting 'positive Sino-British relations', The Times reported. Experts have previously warned about Chinese tactics of 'elite capture' by appointing prominent foreigners as well-paid advisers and making them 'more amenable to Communist Party aims'. Advertisement Separately, foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian warned at a daily briefing today that Britain would bear all consequences for any actions it took over Hong Kong. 'All Chinese compatriots in Hong Kong, including those holding the British National (Overseas) passports, are Chinese citizens,' Zhao said. 'Before Hong Kong returned, the UK side had clearly promised not to provide the right of abode in Britain for holders of the BNO travel documents. The UK side has ignored the Chinese side's solemn position and insisted on changing the policy to provide a route for the relevant individuals to stay in the UK and obtain UK citizenship. '[The UK's move] has seriously breached its own promises and violates international law and the basic principles of international relations. The Chinese side strongly condemns this and reserves the rights of further reactions. The UK should bear any consequences caused by this.' Zhao said no amount of pressure from external forces could 'shake China's determination and will to safeguard national sovereignty and Hong Kong's prosperity and stability', also criticising a US move towards sanctions. Hu Xijin, the editor of the state-run Global Times, struck a different tone by saying that Britain should either grant citizenship immediately or not at all. 'Johnson government should give Hong Kong BNO passport holders UK citizenship, rather than let them go through a long period of uncertainty,' he said. 'No matter what's China's official response, Chinese people have no objection to UK opening its arms to Hongkongers who want to leave.' Britain regards the new security law as a breach of the 1984 treaty which agreed the terms of the handover - but China regards it as a historical document with no validity today. China unveiled the details of the security law on Tuesday night after weeks of uncertainty, pushing one of the world's most glittering financial hubs on to a more authoritarian path. Article 38 of the law even appears to claim jurisdiction over 'every person on the planet' for supposed national security crimes committed overseas. Hong Kong returned to China in 1997 under a deal known as 'one country, two systems' which maintained rights such as free speech and an independent judiciary that are unknown on the mainland. Beijing promised to preserve the city's way of life until at least 2047- but critics say its special status is now dead. Hong Kong police began their new crackdown on dissent yesterday, boasting of their draconian new powers as they rounded up hundreds of pro-democracy activists including a 15-year-old girl waving an independence flag. Police used water cannons, tear gas and pepper spray to drive protesters back on the 23rd anniversary of the former British colony's return to Chinese rule. Three were injured when a man flying a Hong Kong independence flag rammed his motorbike into a group of officers. Ten people were specifically arrested under the new security law, which lines up long prison sentences for crimes of 'subversion' and 'terrorism' which critics fear could be used to silence dissent. Around 370 were arrested on other charges, including unlawful assembly and possessing weapons. Police said that one officer was stabbed in the arm by 'rioters holding sharp objects'. They added that the suspects fled and bystanders offered no help. Authorities later arrested a 24-year-old man at the city's airport in the early hours of Thursday on suspicion of attacking and wounding an officer during protests. A police spokesman said the arrested man was surnamed Wong but could not confirm if he was leaving Hong Kong or working at the airport. Wong had purchased a ticket on Wednesday and boarded the flight with no check-in luggage, the official said. He did not respond to the air crew who called him by name, and was not at his designated seat. Police identified him after conducting a sweep of the plane. Local media reported he was arrested after a relative tipped off police about his his travel plans.

The writing that read ‘Arise! All those who don’t want to be slaves!’ was spotted Wednesday on the street of Hong Kong. It was revealed after a picture of the graffiti was shared on Twitter by Luke de Pulford, a local human rights activist. Hong Kong protesters have sprayed a graffiti (pictured( quoting lyrics from the Chinese national anthem to urge the city to rise up against Beijing’s crackdown on freedoms The quote came from China’s national anthem, ‘March of the Volunteers’ which refers to several volunteer armies that opposed Japan's invasion of Manchuria in the 1930s. Composed by playwright Tian Han in 1934, the song was initially adopted as a provisional anthem in 1949 by the Communist government. When Tian was imprisoned during the Cultural Revolution in the 1960s, the song was briefly and unofficially replaced by 'The East is Red'. It was restored and became the official Chinese national anthem in 1982. The song also became the national anthem for Hong Kong and Macau following their handovers to China in 1997 and 1999, respectively. Advertisement The new law is seen as Beijing's boldest step yet to bring the semi-autonomous territory under control of the authoritarian mainland. Campaigners say the 'one country, two systems' formula which was meant to guarantee Hong Kong's freedoms until 2047 is now dead - but China insists the law is an internal affair targeting only a handful of 'troublemakers'. The law also allows China's feared security agencies to openly set up shop in Hong Kong for the first time, and could open the door for dissidents to be tried on the mainland. An influential group of barristers says the law will weaken the independent judiciary which is seen as key to Hong Kong's success as a business hub. Brought in following anti-government protests last year, it outlaws any action deemed to be against the national interest of China. Anyone shouting slogans or holding flags calling for independence is violating the law, regardless of whether violence is used. Even driving a bus full of protesters could be deemed illegal. The most serious offenders will be labelled 'terrorists', transferred to the mainland and receive a maximum sentence of life in jail. One example of a terror act, for example, is attacking public transport, something protesters often did last year. But it also includes providing support or assistance for such acts. 'This would mean many 'moderate' or peaceful supporters of the protest movement would be caught under the law if the extreme protesters they assisted were to be arrested as terrorists,' Hong Kong lawyer Antony Dapiran said. Some trials will be held behind closed doors. A new police unit unaccountable to local laws has also been given licence to operate in the territory. Beijing, not Hong Kong, will have power over how the law is interpreted. Ahead of the protest, pro-democracy activist Tsang Kin-shing, of the League of Social Democrats, warned there was a 'large chance of our being arrested'. He said: 'The charges will not be light, please judge for yourself.' A man who gave his name as Seth, 35, said: 'I'm scared of going to jail but for justice I have to come out today, I have to stand up.' Media tycoon Jimmy Lai said the law meant Hong Kong was 'dead'. He added: 'It's worse than the worst scenario imagined. Hong Kong is totally subdued, totally under control.' Mr Lai, 72, who also supported the Tiananmen Square protesters in 1989, thinks Beijing will come for him but is unfazed. 'I cannot worry, because you never know what kind of measures they will take against me,' he said.

In a scathing critique, the city's Bar Association said the new law dismantles the legal firewall between Hong Kong's independent judiciary - which is seen as crucial to the city's success as a business hub - and China's Communist Party-controlled courts. The Association said the new national security offences were 'widely drawn' and 'are capable of being applied in a manner that is arbitrary, and that disproportionately interferes with fundamental rights, including the freedom of conscience, expression and assembly'. 'Lawyers, judges, police and Hong Kong residents were given no opportunity to familiarise themselves with the contents of the new law, including the serious criminal offences it creates, before it came into force,' it said. Barristers said the law makes clear 'suspects can be removed to face trial in Mainland China' and points out that the process does not have the usual checks and balances of extradition hearings. It noted the law allowed mainland security agents working in Hong Kong to be 'above the reach of local law' and said empowering the city's chief executive to appoint judges to oversee national security cases undermined judicial independence. In response, China dismissed the statement as 'unfounded', claiming officials had held dialogue sessions with Hong Kong residents to hear their opinions on the law. 'The lawyers' association's claim... that the law lacked meaningful consultation is totally unfounded,' said foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian. Advertisement Hong Kong's Beijing-backed leader Carrie Lam strongly endorsed the new law in her speech marking the 23rd anniversary of the handover yesterday. 'This decision was necessary and timely to maintain Hong Kong's stability,' Lam said following a flag-raising ceremony and the playing of China's national anthem. Speaking at the harbour-front venue where the last British governor Chris Patten handed Hong Kong back to Chinese rule, Lam described it as the most important development in the 23 years since then. Mr Raab yesterday rebuked HSBC for supporting the new law, saying that the rights of Hong Kong should not be 'sacrificed on the altar of bankers' bonuses'. HSBC was originally known as the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation. British banking giants HSBC and Standard Chartered - both with a major presence in Hong Kong and on the mainland - joined other firms in publicly backing the law last month. The Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce described the passing of the law earlier this week as 'instrumental in helping to restore stability and certainty to Hong Kong, which has been severely impacted by the social unrest since last year'. 'We need a stable environment which the (security law) aims to provide.' Analysts and members of the business community have said the law could add to the risk and complexity of doing business in Hong Kong, but is unlikely to spark an exodus of foreign firms because the city is still seen as the gateway to the Chinese economy. The city's Bar Association, an influential group of barristers, said the new law dismantles the legal firewall between Hong Kong's independent judiciary - which is seen as crucial to the city's success as a business hub - and China's Communist Party-controlled courts. Hong Kong restaurant is raided by police for displaying pro-democracy posters A noodle restaurant in Hong Kong has been forced to shut down after police raided the eatery for displaying pro-democracy slogans, pamphlets and figurines.

Many customers have left supportive comments under Mr Lam's post. One commenter wrote: 'They can't tear them down. They are in our hearts.' Another one read: 'The most important thing is that you're safe. We will help you once the business is reopened. One bowl...I'll eat a few more bowls!' Advertisement The Association said the new national security offences were 'widely drawn' and 'are capable of being applied in a manner that is arbitrary, and that disproportionately interferes with fundamental rights, including the freedom of conscience, expression and assembly'. 'Lawyers, judges, police and Hong Kong residents were given no opportunity to familiarise themselves with the contents of the new law, including the serious criminal offences it creates, before it came into force,' it said. China's move has provoked a backlash around the world. The US House of Representatives last night agreed unanimously to seek tough sanctions on Chinese officials and Hong Kong police. On Thursday, Australian leader Scott Morrison said he was 'very actively' considering offering Hong Kongers safe haven. Taiwan has opened an office to help Hong Kongers wanting to flee, while a proposed bill in the United States offering sanctuary to city residents has received widespread bipartisan support. China routinely dismisses all such criticism as interference in its domestic affairs. One of the crimes in the Hong Kong security law explicitly outlaws receiving funding or support from overseas to disrupt lawmaking in Hong Kong or impose sanctions on the city. Amnesty International said the new law was a 'far-reaching threat to Hong Kong's freedoms'. Its Asia-Pacific regional director, Nicholas Bequelin, added: 'With its vague language and provisions for secret trials, hand-picked judges and mainland security agencies operating freely in the city, the law is wide open to politically motivated, capricious and arbitrary interpretation by the authorities. 'Hong Kongers are facing an assault by the Beijing authorities and the Hong Kong government on freedoms that they have long enjoyed.' One major cause of alarm is Article 38 of the law which purports to claim jurisdiction over national security offences committed overseas, even by foreigners. 'If you've ever said anything that might offend [China] or Hong Kong authorities, stay out of Hong Kong,' Donald Clarke, an expert on Chinese law at George Washington University, wrote in an analysis. 'I know of no reason not to think it means what it appears to say: it is asserting extraterritorial jurisdiction over every person on the planet,' Clarke wrote. The UK updated its travel advice on Hong Kong, saying there is an 'increased risk of detention and deportation'. It advised Britons to 'avoid protests and demonstrations.' Political leaders across the spectrum have condemned China's crackdown, which came quicker than anyone expected. But Rod Wye, of the Chatham House think-tank, said Beijing will not care as it takes advantage of global instability and rifts opening up between Western powers. 'The USA and EU are moving in different directions in many areas. It is perhaps to China's advantage that that should be so,' he said.'Expressions of concern are certainly not going to change the Chinese intention one little bit.'

Justice Minister Margarita Cabello described the events at the La Modelo prison in Bogota as an attempted prison escape. But advocates for inmates said officials had cracked down on inmates staging a peaceful protest over conditions they feared would exacerbate infections with the virus. 'Today is a sad and painful day for the country,' Cabello said. The conflict at La Modelo, which houses both suspects and convicts of crimes ranging from burglary to drug trafficking, began late Saturday evening. The relative of an inmate cries as she speaks on the phone outside La Modelo jail in Bogota in Colombia yesterday Relatives of inmates gather outside La Modelo jail in Bogota, Colombia. Violence broke out in the prison out of inmates' fears that authorities are not doing enough to prevent coronavirus inside prisons Inmates shared videos online showing people outside their cells, yelling as shots rang out in the distance. 'They have us abandoned here!' one inmate exclaimed. 'They have us like dogs.' On Sunday, evidence of the violence was still visible. The body of one man lay face-up on a roof, dressed in bright blue shorts, white sneakers and a bloody grey sweatshirt. Family members, many wearing protective masks, gathered outside, trying to get any information they could. 'We're desperate because we don't know anything,' one woman cried. Authorities did not provide a detailed account of how the inmates died, saying only that seven jail workers had also been injured, two critically. Cabello said no inmates had escaped and that to date, none had been diagnosed with coronavirus either. 'This was a criminal attempt to escape that was thwarted,' she said in a video statement. The relative of an inmate cries outside La Modelo jail in Bogota, Colombia after the riot which killed 23 people Jhon Leon, director of Judicial Solidarity, an organization that works to improve inmate conditions, said prisoners had planned a nationwide protest Saturday evening after complaining about the dire state of jails for two weeks without getting a reply. The National Prison Movement, a group of inmates and their relatives, released a statement earlier in the week, saying Colombia's prisons don't have enough doctors and nurses on staff, nor sufficient medicines to treat basic illnesses. 'Those deprived of liberty raise our voices in rejection of the policies and ineffective actions that have been taken,' the group said. Leon said about 5,000 people housed in the jail, some of whom are kept six to a cell while others sleep in hallways. Prisoners want elderly inmates and those with preexisting conditions to be moved to other locations and be put in isolation, he said. They also want more information on whether any inmates have been tested for the coronavirus. Inmates point from inside of La Modelo jail in Bogota. Colombia had confirmed 231 coronavirus cases and two deaths as of Sunday 'This was a peaceful protest,' Leon said. 'The response of authorities was overhanded.' Colombia had confirmed 231 coronavirus cases and two deaths as of Sunday. But with notoriously overcrowded and often violent prisons, many are concerned that the virus could spread quickly there. For most people, the new coronavirus causes only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever or coughing. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia. The government has taken a handful of initial measures, including barring relatives from visiting inmates. The relative of an inmate cries outside La Modelo jail in Bogota. Family members are searching for more information about what happened The penitentiary service also said it is reducing the number of workers in certain areas to create more distance between people, allowing older workers and those with preexisting conditions to stay home and organizing disinfection cleaning crews. One group of 10 inmates has been employed to create masks. But human rights advocates want the government to go further, taking measures like freeing those about to finish their sentences or who are jailed as a preventative measure for non-violent crimes. On Sunday, evidence of the violence was still visible. The body of one man lay face-up on a roof, dressed in bright blue shorts, white sneakers and a bloody grey sweatshirt As of early 2019, there were 120,000 inmates in Colombia's jails, far beyond the official capacity to hold about 80,000 prisoners. The attorney general's office, among other institutions, has found that inmates have trouble accessing basic services like clean water. 'Colombia should take urgent action to mitigate the risks in the jails,' said José Miguel Vivanco, Americas director for Human Rights Watch. Inmates display a sign reading in Spanish 'More than 30 dead' at La Modelo jail in Bogota yesterday It's an issue for many nations in the region and around the world: With nearly 1.5 million prisoners behind bars, Latin America's packed jails are an ideal breeding ground for disease. In Brazil, hundreds of prisoners from several facilities in Sao Paulo state have escaped in recent days while family members of opposition activists jailed in Venezuela say they fear for their loved ones amid unconfirmed reports that four police officers at the country's most notorious jail for political prisoners have come down sick with the illness. In the US, authorities across the country have been ordering the release of non-violent offenders and restricting the number of new detainees to prevent spread of the disease. But such solutions have been slower to materialize in Latin America, where jails are frequently overcrowded and run by violent gangs."", ""ARE YOU TRAVELLING IN ECUADOR?

Crazed criminals have rampaged through the South American country's cities today after President Daniel Noboa, 36, ordered a state of emergency. Hooded gangsters seized a state TV news studio today, while a university was attacked and jail guards reportedly executed by prisoners. Ecuador has been rocked by a series of attacks including explosions and the abduction of several police officers after the government imposed a state of emergency in the wake of the escape of a powerful gang leader from prison. Adolfo 'Fito' Macías, 44, the leader of Los Choneros gang, was found missing from his cell in a low security prison on the same day he was supposed to be transferred to a maximum security facility, on Sunday. A manhunt is underway for Macías and Los Lobos leader Fabricio Colon Pico, who also escaped prison on Tuesday since his arrest last Friday for alleged involvement in a plot to assassinate Ecuador's attorney general.

Los Choneros is one of the Ecuadorian gangs authorities consider responsible for a spike in violence that reached a new level last year with the assassination of presidential candidate Fernando Villavicencio. The gang has links with Mexico's Sinaloa cartel, according to authorities. Experts and authorities have acknowledged that gang members practically rule from inside the prisons, and Macías was believed to have continued controlling his group from within the detention facility. Prison guards have reportedly been executed by the country's cartel thugs.

In February 2013, Macías escaped from a maximum security facility but was recaptured weeks later. In 2021, Macías's girlfriend was briefly arrested after she spent a week sleeping in his jail cell - and was busted as she tried to leave the prison in the middle of a riot while wearing a guard's uniform.

Why has violence spiralled in Ecuador? The country has been beset with violence from gangs battling for control in spiralling turf wars that see gun massacres and beheadings. Ecuador is situated between world-leading cocaine producers Colombia and Peru and has become a centre for foreign and domestic drug cartels. Guayaquil, a coastal city that is Ecuador's largest, is considered the country's most dangerous, with its ports a hub for drug smuggling. Noboa took office in November touting his 'Phoenix Plan' for security, including a new intelligence unit, tactical weapons for security forces, new high-security prisons and reinforced security at ports and airports. Security in Ecuador has been worsening since the coronavirus pandemic, which also brutally battered the economy. Ecuador's prisons have become a hotbed of violence, with the cartels fighting for power inside the country's jails, from which they then exert vast influence. Fishermen have been massacred at ports, maimed bodies have been hanged from bridges and riots have left hundreds dead in prisons. Prisons have become a hotbed of violence, with the cartels fighting for power inside the country's jails, from which they then exert vast influence. Since 2018, the national murder rate has more than quadrupled, soaring from six to 26 per 100,000 inhabitants - a rate that places it in the worst 15 countries. The country's National Police tallied 3,568 violent deaths in the first six months of 2023, far more than the 2,042 reported during the same period in 2022. That year ended with 4,600 violent deaths, the country's highest in history and double the total in 2021. Violent deaths nationally rose to 8,008 in 2023, the government has said, nearly double the 2022 figure. Violence in Ecuador culminated in August with the assassination of presidential candidate Fernando Villavicencio, plunging the country into chaos. A national emergency was declared in the wake of the assassination, while Ecuador's economic capital, Guayaquil, has seen multiple successive states of emergency imposed. In the north, the city of Esmeraldas is also frequently at the centre of turf wars, as cartels battle for control over the country's key drug supply routes. Behind the violence is what the UN's Office on Drugs and Crime describes as a global 'prolonged surge in both the supply of and demand for cocaine'. As the US market turns to other drugs such as fentanyl, the European market has bolstered demand for the powder, with gangs in the Balkans as well as Italy's feared 'Ndrangheta mafia understood to have expanded into Ecuador. Advertisement A TC employee said in a WhatsApp message: 'Please, they came in to kill us. 'God don't let this happen. 'The criminals are on air.' Journalists on screen were reportedly heard screaming 'they want to kill us all'. One of the hooded men who attacked the set reportedly said: 'We are on the air so that they know that we do not play with the mafia.' After about 30 minutes of chaos, police officers were seen entering the studio while someone then called out that they 'have a wounded companion.' All the gunmen who broke into the studio were arrested, a police commander said. Alina Manrique, the head of news for TC Television, said she was in the control room across from the studio when the masked men entered the building. One of the men pointed a gun at her head and told her to get on the floor, she said. Some of the assailants ran from the studio and tried to hide elsewhere in the building when they realised they were surrounded by police, she added. 'I am still in shock,' Ms Manrique told the Associated Press in a phone interview. 'Everything has collapsed. 'All I know is that it's time to leave this country, and go very far away.' Shortly after the gunmen stormed the TV station, President Noboa issued another decree designating 20 drug trafficking gangs operating in the country as terrorist groups and authorising Ecuador's military to 'neutralise' the groups - within the bounds of international humanitarian law. Ecuador's national police chief announced a short time later that authorities had arrested all the masked intruders. Cesar Zapata told the TV channel Teleamazonas that officers had seized the guns and explosives. He did not say how many people were arrested. 'This is an act that should be considered as a terrorist act,' Mr Zapata added. President Noboa decreed a national state of emergency for 60 days on Monday, allowing the authorities to suspend rights and mobilize the military in places like prisons. The government also imposed a curfew from 11pm to 5am. Noboa had vowed on Monday to 'not negotiate with terrorists nor rest until we return peace to all Ecuadorans.' He added that his government had decided to confront crime. Noboa was elected in October on a pledge to fight rampant drug-related crime and violence in the South American country - once considered a bastion of peace, but now a key stop on the US- and Europe-bound cocaine trade. He vowed Monday to bring the fight to the cartels after a powerful gang leader, Adolfo Macias, known as 'Fito,' escaped from prison the previous day.

Agents also arrested two people for possession of explosives and as suspects in at least one of the attacks in the South American country. The government has not said how many attacks were registered in total, but local media reported several, including some in northern cities, where vehicles were set on fire, and others in Quito, including an explosion near the house of the president of the National Justice Court. Authorities have not said if the incidents are part an orchestrated action. Neighbouring country Peru's government declared an emergency along its northern border on Tuesday. Prime Minister Alberto Otarola made the announcement, noting that the emergency declaration would deploy an unspecified number of army troops to support police forces. Peru's defense and interior ministers will also travel to the border to coordinate operations, according to the prime minister. Earlier in the day, Peru's interior minister ordered the 'immediate' deployment of police to the border in a bid to boost security. The Ecuadorian government has previously accused members of the main drug gangs for similar strikes. The US State Department said on Tuesday it was 'extremely concerned' by violence in Ecuador which has led the country's president to declare a state of emergency and deploy military into the streets.

'We are seeing Cubans rise up and protest for their rights like never before. We stand in solidarity with them, and we condemn the anti-democratic actions led by President Diaz-Canel. The suppression of the media, speech and protest are all gross violations of civil rights,' AOC wrote in a statement posted on Twitter. 'We also must name the U.S. contribution to Cuban suffering: our sixty-year-old embargo. Last month, once again, the U.N. voted overwhelmingly to call on the United States to lift its embargo on Cuba. 'The embargo is absurdly cruel and, like too many other U.S. policies targeting Latin Americans, the cruelty is the point. I outright reject the Biden administration's defense of the embargo. It is never acceptable for us to use cruelty as a point of leverage against every day people.' On Thursday, Biden called communism a 'failed system' and said 'I don't see socialism as a very useful substitute' after Florida Democrats and Republicans including Ron DeSantis pushed him to condemn the regime. For days after the protests started, the Biden administration refused to mention communism and instead said the social turmoil was the result of 'government mismanagement'. Biden said there were a 'number of things' his administration could to help the Cuban people but he expressed concern the communist-led government would take control of any aid sent there, such as remittances or COVID vaccines. 'They've cut off access to the internet. We're considering whether we have the technology to reinstate that access.' The widespread internet blackouts are believed to have been sparked by the government during the crackdown on protesters in the streets of Cuba. AOC's response to the crisis in Cuba mirrors a Black Lives Matter statement on Thursday, which blamed the 'cruel and inhumane' US for the current unrest in Cuba and praised the Communist regime for its 'solidarity' with oppressed people. BLM accused the US of causing the instability with its embargoes which have caused 'pain and suffering' for Cubans for 60 years in the message which was branded 'worse than embarrassing'.

Sanders broke his silence on Tuesday and demanded the US end its embargo which 'has only hurt, not helped the Cuban people' and urged the communist nation's government to refrain from violence against the island's protesters and opposition. 'All people have the right to protest and to live in a democratic society,' Vermont Sen. Sanders tweeted. 'I call on the Cuban government to respect opposition rights and refrain from violence. It's also long past time to end the unilateral U.S. embargo on Cuba, which has only hurt, not helped, the Cuban people.'

Cuba is going through its worst economic crisis in decades, along with a resurgence of coronavirus cases, as it suffers the consequences of U.S. sanctions imposed by former President Donald Trump's administration. Large contingents of Cuban police patrolled the capital, Havana, on Monday following rare protests around the island nation against food shortages and high prices amid the coronavirus crisis. Cuba's president, Miguel Díaz-Canel, said the demonstrations were stirred up on social media by Cuban Americans in the United States. Some Republican lawmakers, including Florida Governor Ron DeSantis and Texas Senator Ted Cruz, have praised the protests despite regularly villainizing protesters in their own states 'Florida supports the people of Cuba as they take to the streets against the tyrannical regime in Havana. The Cuban dictatorship has repressed the people of Cuba for decades & is now trying to silence those who have the courage to speak out against its disastrous policies,' DeSantis tweeted Sen. Lindsey Graham encouraged the Biden administration to get involved, telling the White House not to be 'AWOL' In a post shared to its 4.5million Instagram followers, BLM said: 'Black Lives Matter condemns the US federal government's inhumane treatment of Cubans, and urges it to immediately lift the economic embargo. 'This cruel and inhumane policy, instituted with the explicit intention of destabilizing the country and undermining Cubans' right to choose their own government, is at the heart of Cuba's current crisis. 'Since 1962, the United States has forced pain and suffering on the people of Cuba by cutting off food, medicine and supplies, costing the tiny island nation an estimated $130billion. 'Without that money, it is harder for Cuba to acquire medical equipment needed to develop its own Covid-19 vaccines and equipment for food production. This comes in spite of the country's strong medical care and history of lending doctors and nurses to disasters around the world.' On Monday, Secretary of State Antony Blinken denied claims the US was to blame for the unrest. He said a mismanaged economy was the root of the problems, which have seen people take to the streets. BLM's statement continued: 'The people of Cuba are being punished by the US government because the country has maintained its commitment to sovereignty and self-determination. 'United States leaders have tried to crush this revolution for decades. Instead of international amity, respect and goodwill, the US government has only instigated suffering for the country's 11 million people - of which four million are Black and Brown. 'Cuba has historically demonstrated solidarity with oppressed peoples of African descent, from protecting Black revolutionaries like Assata Shakur through granting her asylum, to supporting Black liberation struggles in Angola, Mozambique, Guinea Bissau and South Africa. 'Now, we look to President Biden to end the embargo, something Barack Obama called for in 2016. This embargo is a blatant human rights violation and it must come to an end.' Shakur, a former member of the Black Liberation Army, was convicted of being an accomplice to the murder of State Trooper Werner Foerster in 1973. At the time, she was also wanted for several felonies, including bank robber counts in New York and was known for her membership of the Black Panthers. Shakur was with two other people when they were pulled over on the New Jersey Turnpike. The three opened fire on the troopers. Passenger James Coston was shot and killed by Officer James Harper. The shootout continued until Shakur, having shot and killed Foerster execution-style fled the scene with the surviving passenger, who remains in prison. Both were apprehended by police shortly thereafter.

Another demonstration is expected Tuesday at 5pm The White House responded to the accusation saying: 'That's simply inaccurate,' 'There's every indication that yesterday's protests were reactions of the people in Cuba to exhaustion of the governance of the leaders of the state,' White House press secretary Jen Psaki said on Monday at her daily briefing. Díaz-Canel denounced vandalism that took place during the demonstrations. 'They threw stones at foreign currency shops, they stole items... and at police forces, they turned over cars - a totally vulgar, indecent and delinquent behavior,' he said. But the president said pro-government supporters had finally restored order after instructing them to fight back and 'defend the revolution' - orders that caused consternation among some Cubans. In Miami, where many Cubans who opposed Fidel Castro's regime fled after the Cuban Revolution, opponents of the revolutionary leaders started marching in solidarity with protesters still on the island.

The Cuban dictatorship has repressed the people of Cuba for decades & is now trying to silence those who have the courage to speak out against its disastrous policies,' DeSantis tweeted. 'The Communist Cuban regime will be consigned to the dustbin of history. It has brutalized & denied freedom to generations of Cubans, and forced my family & so many others to flee. The American people stand squarely with the men & women of Cuba and their noble fight for liberty,' Senator Cruz tweeted. In Miami, a group of Cuban exiles and local conservative activists from Venezuela, Colombia and Nicaragua called for people in the city to support Cuba and called for the Biden administration to intervene in the aftermath of massive protests on the island. 'The Cuban people are not on the streets asking for medicine, they're not on the streets asking for food. They're in the streets demanding freedom,' said Orlando Gutierrez-Boronat, a Cuban exile and member of the Assembly for Cuban Resistance, based in Miami. Gutierrez-Boronat said he was supportive of young people on the island taking to the streets and would like to see the U.S. to intervene militarily. 'What they are saying is they don't want a tomorrow with the Communist Party in charge.'

'We have to support those who are inside Cuba who are the real protagonists of this change,' said Garcia Perez told the Miami Herald. 'I, as a political prisoner, as an anti-Castro fighter, I am filled with hope to make a soon return to my homeland. 'Those people who are out on the streets are not asking for rafts. They're not asking for boats, they're not asking for planes or visas. They're asking for freedom', he said. In Havana, many young people took part in the demonstrations. Protests were also held elsewhere on the island, including in the small town of San Antonio de los Baños, where people objected to power outages and were visited by President Miguel Díaz-Canel. He entered a few homes, where he took questions from residents. Authorities appeared determined to put a stop to the demonstrations. More than a dozen protesters were detained, including a leading Cuban dissident who was arrested trying to attend a march in the city of Santiago, 550 miles east. The demonstrators disrupted traffic in the capital for several hours until some threw rocks and police moved in and broke them up.

Amnesty International said it had received with alarm reports of 'internet blackouts, arbitrary arrests, excessive use of force - including police firing on demonstrators.' Network monitoring company Kentik said it had observed the entire country go offline for less than 30 minutes at around 4pm on Sunday, followed by several hours of intermittent outages. 'Until very recently, large internet outages were very rare,' said Doug Madory, Kentik's director of Internet analysis. 'Internet shutdowns are new to Cuba in 2021.' Internet blockage observatory NetBlocks said there was partial disruption to social media and messaging platforms in Cuba on Monday, 'likely to limit the flow of information from Cuba.' 'We've seen how the campaign against Cuba was growing on social media in the past few weeks,'' Díaz-Canel said Monday in a nationally televised appearance in which his entire Cabinet was also present. 'That's the way it's done: Try to create inconformity, dissatisfaction by manipulating emotions and feelings.' Cuban President Miguel Díaz-Canel on Wednesday acknowledged shortcomings in his government's handling of shortages and of neglecting certain sectors, but he urged Cubans to not act with hate - a reference to violence during recent street protests Cuba's President Miguel Diaz Canel walks with his followers after an anti-government protest in San Antonio de los Banos, Cuba, on Sunday Police stand guard near the National Capitol building in Havana, Cuba A Cuban flag hangs on Parque Central Hotel in Havana, Cuba, on Monday. Things were quieter in the Cuban capital Police stand guard near the National Capitol building in Havana, Cuba, on Monday President Joe Biden called the protesters 'remarkable' and made a brief statement on Cuban demonstrations on Monday from the Roosevelt Room In a statement Monday, U.S. President Joe Biden said Cuban protesters were asserting their basic rights. 'We stand with the Cuban people and their clarion call for freedom and relief from the tragic grip of the pandemic and from the decades of repression and economic suffering to which they have been subjected by Cuba's authoritarian regime,' Biden said. 'The U.S. urges the Cuban government to serve their people rather than enriching themselves,'' Biden added. 'The Cuban people are demanding their freedom from an authoritarian regime. I don't think we've seen anything like these protests in a long long time if, quite frankly ever,' the president said. 'The US stands firmly with the people of Cuba as they assert their universal rights. And we call on the government of Cuba to refrain from violence in their attempt to silence the voices of the people of Cuba.' U.N. deputy spokesman Farhan Haq on Monday stressed the U.N. position 'on the need for freedom of expression and peaceful assembly to be respected fully, and we expect that that will be the case.' The demonstrations were extremely unusual on an island where little dissent against the government is tolerated. The last major public demonstration of discontent, over economic hardship, took place nearly 30 years in 1994. Last year, there were small demonstrations by artists and other groups, but nothing as big or widespread as what erupted this past weekend. People walk through Paseo del Prado in Havana, Cuba on a far quieter day compared to Sunday Police stand guard near the National Capitol building in Havana, Cuba on Monday Thousands of Cubans took part in rare protests Sunday against the Communist government, marching through a town chanting 'Down with the dictatorship' and 'We want liberty'.

'Enough!' and 'Unite!' One motorcyclist pulled out a U.S. flag, but it was snatched from him by others. 'We are fed up with the queues, the shortages. That's why I'm here,' one middle-age protester said. Later, about 300 pro-government protesters arrived with a large Cuban flag, shouting slogans in favor of the late President Fidel Castro and the Cuban revolution. Some assaulted a video journalist with the AP, smashing his camera. Photojournalist Ramón Espinosa also of the AP was then beaten by a group of police officers in uniforms and civilian clothes; he suffered a broken nose and an eye injury. The demonstration grew to a few thousand in the vicinity of Galeano Avenue and the marchers pressed on despite a few charges by police officers and tear gas barrages. People standing on many balconies along the central artery in the Centro Habana neighborhood applauded the protesters passing by. Others joined in the march. About 2 1/2 hours into the march, some protesters pulled up cobblestones and threw them at police, at which point officers began arresting people and the marchers dispersed. At least 20 people were taken away in police cars or by individuals in civilian clothes. Although many people tried to take out their cellphones and broadcast the protest live, Cuban authorities shut down internet service throughout the afternoon Sunday. On Monday, Cuban authorities were once again blocking Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram and Telegram, said Alp Toker, director of Netblocks, a London-based internet monitoring firm confirmed. 'This does seem to be a response to social media-fueled protest,' he said. Twitter did not appear to be blocked, though Toker noted Cuba has the ability to cut it off if it wants to.""]"

Documents presented by Facebook whistleblower Frances Haugen show how multiple studies were run producing a number various number detailing the types of users who were most likely to share fake news. Lawmakers, academics and the White House urged Facebook to share such information publicly. Facebook employees also knew misinformation about the coronavirus was dominating parts of the social media platform creating 'echo-chamber-like effects' ultimately reinforcing hesitancy over the vaccine. Researchers at Facebook were well aware that misinformation about coronavirus was spreading across its platform but did little to prevent it White House press secretary Jen Psaki said on Wednesday that it is 'unfortunately not surprising' for the administration to learn that Facebook knew of its problems with vaccine misinformation The trove of documents shows that in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, Facebook carefully investigated how its platforms spread misinformation about life-saving vaccines. They also reveal rank-and-file employees regularly suggested solutions for countering anti-vaccine content on the site, to no avail. Facebook's internal discussions were revealed in disclosures made to the Securities and Exchange Commission and provided to Congress in redacted form by former Facebook employee-turned-whistleblower Frances Haugen's legal counsel. Some researchers detailed how postings by professional organizations such as the World Health Organization, were flooded by anti-vaccine comments essentially hijacking the pro-vaccine message and further spreading falsehoods. The scale of the problem is known only to Facebook and it is not being shared with the White House, however social media platform was acutely aware that vaccine misinformation was a huge problem on its sites. Anti-vaxxers protested on Times Square against vaccination mandates earlier this month But when communicating with the public both in testimony before Congress and blog posts, execs stressed the positive response by the social media network and just how many pieces of misinformation it had removed including helping its users to find vaccination points closer to them. 'For months, I've repeatedly requested information from Facebook about covid misinformation, including questions about which users post it, how the platform amplifies it, how Facebook decides what to remove, and much more,' Rep. Anna G. Eshoo (D-Calif.) said to The Washington Post. 'I asked these questions because policymakers need to understand how covid misinformation spreads and how we can mitigate its harmful effects on vaccine hesitancy and public health. It was the whistleblower documents that shed light on these issues, instead of Facebook releasing them a long time ago,' Eshoo continued. Facebook have released their own statement on the situation stressing the company worked to promote reliable information about coronavirus throughout the pandemic. The company noted vaccine hesitancy among U.S. Facebook users has gone down by 50 percent since January. 'There's no silver bullet to fighting misinformation, which is why we take a comprehensive approach which includes removing more than 20 million pieces of content that break our covid misinformation policies … connecting more than 2 billion people to reliable information about covid-19 and vaccines, and partnering with independent fact-checkers,' Spokesperson Aasron Simpson said. Protesters against vaccine and mask mandates demonstrate near Santa Fe, New Mexico. New documents raise questions about how Facebook responded to anti-vaccine content White House press secretary Jen Psaki said on Wednesday that it is 'unfortunately not surprising' for the administration to learn that Facebook knew of its problems with vaccine misinformation. 'While social media plays an important role in society, it is clear that we need a whole of society approach to end this pandemic,' Facebook Vice President Guy Rosen wrote in a blog. 'Facts — not allegations — should help inform that effort.' 'We've continued to see platforms regularly amplify anti-vaccine content over accurate information,' Psaki said. 'That's the basic problem. And that's what we continue to see happen.' Facebook 'set the stage … by allowing vast numbers of conspiracies to be promoted on their platform so people don't trust the experts,' Hany Farid, a computer science researcher said. The internal documents show how Facebook employees were even able to see how pieces of misinformation spread. One post was noted to have racked up 53,000 re-shares and upwards of 3 million impressions after an error with Facebook's algorithms. Rep. Eshoo asked for the company to provide information on how often misinformation was being looked at on the site and whether advertisers were being alerted, but the company ignored her request. 'At this time, we have nothing to share in response to the questions you have raised, outside of what Mark Zuckerberg has said publicly,' the company wrote in response, one month later. Facebook employees were essentially facing a losing battle as they tried to combat misinformation with the possibility that any post could potentially go viral at any time. Comments were as bad as the postings in many cases and almost impossible to police. 'Vaccine hesitancy in comments is rampant,' stated one researcher. Prior to 2019, the company did not interfere with content that was anti-vaccine but it did stop recommending pages and groups with vaccine misinformation. The company began the crackdown in earnest during the pandemic started blocking adverts that contained inaccurate information on vaccines. In December the company began removed posts that spread misinformation about the safety, side effects, efficacy or ingredients of the vaccines. On Thursday, Facebook announced its parent company was rebranding will now go by the name Meta as Mark Zuckerberg tries to distance the social media behemoth from mounting scandals. Zuckerberg made the announcement at the Facebook Connect augmented and virtual reality conference. Meta refers to the 'metaverse,' Zuckerberg's vision for the company's transition into shared augmented reality, where uses work and play in virtual world environments. The attempt to escape reality couldn't come at a better time for the embattled brand, which will retain the Facebook name, but Facebook Inc. - the parent company that also owns Instagram and WhatsApp - will now go under the new title Meta. It will begin trading under MVRS on December 1. Facebook changed its name to Meta in reference to its goal of expanding beyond social media, CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced Thursday at the Facebook Connect augmented and virtual reality conference Employees pulled down a curtain draped over its iconic 'Like' sign outside the company's Silicon Valley headquarters was pulled down to reveal the new branding It includes a new logo depicting a blue infinity symbol and refers to the 'metaverse', the company's new focus to expand beyond its social media apps Haugen, a Facebook former product manager, left the company with tens of thousands of confidential documents that she copied in secret and released to roughly two dozen news outlets. She testified before Congress on October 5 and the British Parliament on Monday, presenting findings on the harm social media caused young users. One revealed that 13.5% of British teenagers and 6% of American teenagers experiencing suicidal thoughts said that they traced them to Instagram. A message posted on an internal message board in March 2020 and revealed in Haugen's documents said the app revealed that 32% of girls said Instagram made them feel worse about their bodies if they were already having insecurities. Another recent claim against the company is that Instagram bombards women and girls who suffer from eating disorders with images and videos of exceedingly thin females and others afflicted with anorexia. Internal documents revealed that Instagram's algorithm curates options based on searches and preferences of users who express interest in dieting, weight loss, and thinness. Instagram researchers this year conducted an experiment in which they typed in terms like #skinny and #thin are then offered to browse through other accounts that feature dangerously emaciated women and girls. Another core finding in the leaked documents was that Facebook staff have reported for years that they are concerned about the company's failure to police hate speech and that its algorithms flooded users with extremist content and conspiracy theories based on their political beliefs. Internal messages from staff at the social media giant show that they blamed themselves for the January 6 Capitol riot after giving extremist content a platform on the site. 'One of the darkest days in the history of democracy and self-governance. History will not judge us kindly,' said one worker while another said: 'We've been fueling this fire for a long time and we shouldn't be surprised it's now out of control.' Haugen's leaked documents also reveal that Facebook potentially mislead the US Securities and Exchange Commission by failing to disclose that its popularity among young users is slumping. It is said to have failed to explain that many of its overall users are people with more than one account on its sites, meaning the actual number of users could be up to 11% fewer than its figures would suggest. One trend shows that the time spent on Facebook by U.S. teenagers was down 16% from 2020 to 2021 and that young adults, between 18 and 29, were spending 5% less time on the app, according to reporting from Bloomberg. Facebook whistleblower Frances Haugen testifying before British lawmakers on Monday about her concerns over the tech giant's power in the tech and telecomms space. She said, among other things, that Facebook misleads the world by claiming it helps non-English-speaking companies with its technology, when it in fact fuels extremism Despite an avalanche of damaging whistleblower claims surfacing at the start of this week in what became known as the Facebook Papers, Meta on Monday reported soaring profits for the latest quarter. The company said that its net income grew 17% in the July-September period to $9.19 billion, buoyed by strong advertising revenue. That's up from profits of $7.85 billion a year earlier. Meta stock rose more than 1% in after-hours trading Tuesday and rose by more than 3% on Thursday afternoon before dropping to about 1.5% by 5pm. Third quarter revenue grew 35% to $29.01 billion, exceeding analyst expectations. The company's name change includes a new logo depicting a blue infinity symbol and refers to the 'metaverse', its new focus to expand beyond its social media apps. The term 'metaverse' can refer to digital spaces, which are made more lifelike by the use of virtual reality or augmented reality. 'Our mission remains the same, it's still about bringing people together,' he said, adding, 'Now we have a new North Star to help bring the metaverse to life.' He added that the word means 'beyond' in Greek and symbolizes that there is 'always more to build' and 'always a next chapter in the story.' 'I believe the metaverse is the next chapter of the Internet and it's the next chapter of our company too,' he said, adding, 'While most etch companies focus on how people could connect to technology, we focus on building technology so people could connect with each other.' Zuckerberg has previously suggested the metaverse to be the future of the company, and has been talking up the metaverse since July. The company has invested heavily in virtual reality and augmented reality, developing hardware such as its Oculus VR headsets and working on AR glasses and wristband technologies. The buzzy word, first coined in a dystopian novel three decades earlier, is popular in Silicon Valley and has been referenced by other tech firms such as Microsoft. In addition to its name change, Meta also announced an upcoming virtual reality headset called Project Cambria, a high-end product available to be released next year at a higher price point than the $299 Quest 2 headset, the company said in a blog post. Meta also announced the code name of its first fully AR-capable smart glasses: Project Nazare. The glasses are 'still a few years out,' the company said in a blog post and Zuckerberg noted, 'we still have a ways to go with Nazare, but we're making good progress.' The move to Meta is reminiscent of when Google abruptly renamed itself Alphabet in 2015, making Google a subsidiary and allowing it to become a technology conglomerate. Meta is set to trade under MVRS from December 1. The company's stock rose more than 1 percent in after-hours trading Tuesday and rose by more than 3% on Thursday Zuckerberg has previously suggested the metaverse to be future of the company, and has been talking up the metaverse since July In the metaverse, users' avatars move and change their expression in real time with the user But the burning question on the minds of many is whether the name is enough to help Meta shake off it's mounting public relations nightmares. For the company's independent oversight board, the answer is no. The group released a statement shortly after the announcement, saying, 'Changing their name doesn't change reality: Facebook is destroying our democracy and is the world's leading peddler of disinformation and hate.' It continued, 'Their meaningless name change should not distract from the investigation, regulation and real, independent oversight needed to hold Facebook accountable.' The company is attempting to 'divert the conversation from their current problems onto the metaverse, which is exciting and futuristic,' Anne Olderog, a senior partner at the consulting firm Vivaldi with 20 years of brand-strategy experience, told Business Insider. She called it a 'brilliant move' because 'truly, nobody understands' the metaverse. However, she added that the public could 'definitely see through things like that at this stage.' 'Facebook is the world's social media platform and they are being accused of creating something that is harmful to people and society,' marketing consultant Laura Ries told the Associated Press. She compared the name Meta to when BP rebranded to 'Beyond Petroleum' to escape criticism that it harmed the environment. 'They can't walk away from the social network with a new corporate name and talk of a future metaverse.' The company has invested heavily in virtual reality and augmented reality, developing hardware such as its Oculus VR headsets and working on AR glasses and wristband technologies In addition to a new drop of documents from Haugen last Monday that became known as the Facebook Papers, U.S. officials announced Meta had agreed to pay up to $14.25 million to settle civil claims by the government that the company discriminated against American workers and violated federal recruitment rules. And last Tuesday in the U.K., the company was fined $70 million after failing to provide enough important information to the competition regulator investigating the firm's takeover of GIF sharing platform Giphy. Britain's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) launched a probe into the acquisition in June last year, shortly after the deal was announced, over concerns about a 'substantial lessening of competition.' Facebook responded to the fine, saying: 'We strongly disagree with the CMA's unfair decision to punish Facebook for a best effort compliance approach, which the CMA itself ultimately approved. We will review the CMA's decision and consider our options.' Facebook has also admitted that users can share information about how to enter countries illegally and about people smuggled on its social media platforms. The admission comes as Arizona Attorney General Mark Brnovich urged the Department of Justice and US Attorney General Merrick Garland to investigate the social media giant over its 'facilitation' of illegal migration into the United States. The move could benefit the California-based behemoth's reputation, which has suffered hit after hit in recent years. The company had been facing a number of scandals long before its controversy over the Facebook Papers. It was accused of facilitating the spread of misinformation during the 2016 US presidential election, prompting a a series of congressional hearings and policy changes, including the introduction of third-party fact-checkers and further transparency in political advertising. In 2019, the Federal Trade Commission fined Facebook $5 billion for allowing 87 million US profiles to be harvested for information used for political advertising by British firm Cambridge Analytica. Some of the advertising was used to help the 2016 campaign of former president Donald Trump. When announcing the new name, Zuckerberg paid no notice to any of the scandals or Facebook Papers, but focused solely on Meta's goals going forward. Those familiar with the popular children's game Roblox already know the metaverse as it describes itself as a metaverse company. Epic Games' Fortnite is also considered to be part of the metaverse. The metaverse is 'going to be a big focus, and I think that this is just going to be a big part of the next chapter for the way that the internet evolves after the mobile internet,' Zuckerberg told The Verge earlier this year. 'And I think it's going to be the next big chapter for our company too, really doubling down in this area.' On Sunday, Meta announced it was hiring 10,000 people in Europe to build the metaverse out."", ""Whistleblowers at social media giant Facebook are saying the company didn't do enough to stop the spread of misinformation in the days and weeks leading up to, as well as during, the Capitol riot on January 6. New internal documents provided by former Facebook employee-turned-whistleblower Frances Haugen provide a rare glimpse into how the company appears to have simply stumbled into the Jan. 6 riot. Reports say that in California, Facebook engineers were racing to tweak internal controls to slow the spread of misinformation and inciteful content. Emergency actions - some of which were rolled back after the 2020 election - included banning Trump, freezing comments in groups with a record for hate speech, filtering out the 'Stop the Steal' rallying cry and empowering content moderators to act more assertively by labeling the U.S. a 'Temporary High Risk Location' for political violence. At the same time, frustration inside Facebook erupted over what some saw as the company's halting and often reversed response to rising extremism in the U.S. Former Facebook employee Frances Haugen (pictured above) has provided new details on the company's response to the Capitol riot Five people died in the insurrection, which attempted to stop American electors from certifying the 2020 Presidential Election for Joe Biden Within Facebook, there were complaints that the company hadn't done enough to stop the spread of misinformation extremism that people believe led to the riots 'Haven´t we had enough time to figure out how to manage discourse without enabling violence?' one employee wrote on an internal message board at the height of the Jan. 6 turmoil. 'We´ve been fueling this fire for a long time and we shouldn´t be surprised it´s now out of control.' It´s a question that still hangs over the company today, as Congress and regulators investigate Facebook´s part in the Jan. 6 riots. It quickly became clear that even after years under the microscope for insufficiently policing its platform, the social network had missed how riot participants spent weeks vowing - on Facebook itself - to stop Congress from certifying Joe Biden´s election victory. The documents also appear to bolster Haugen´s claim that Facebook put its growth and profits ahead of public safety, opening the clearest window yet into how Facebook´s conflicting impulses - to safeguard its business and protect democracy - clashed in the days and weeks leading up to the attempted Jan. 6 coup. This story is based in part on disclosures Haugen made to the Securities and Exchange Commission and provided to Congress in redacted form by Haugen´s legal counsel. The redacted versions received by Congress were obtained by a consortium of news organizations, including The Associated Press. What Facebook called 'Break the Glass' emergency measures put in place on Jan. 6 were essentially a toolkit of options designed to stem the spread of dangerous or violent content that the social network had first used in the run-up to the bitter 2020 election. As many as 22 of those measures were rolled back at some point after the election, according to an internal spreadsheet analyzing the company's response. 'As soon as the election was over, they turned them back off or they changed the settings back to what they were before, to prioritize growth over safety,' Haugen said in an interview with '60 Minutes.' A Capitol police officer was one of the five people who died as a result of the riot New internal documents provided by former Facebook employee-turned-whistleblower Frances Haugen provide a rare glimpse into how the company, after years under the microscope for the policing of its platform, appears to have simply stumbled into the Jan. 6 riot Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg has faced heavy criticism for how his platform controls information and data An internal Facebook report following Jan. 6, previously reported by BuzzFeed, faulted the company for having a 'piecemeal' approach to the rapid growth of 'Stop the Steal' pages, related misinformation sources, and violent and inciteful comments. Facebook says the situation is more nuanced and that it carefully calibrates its controls to react quickly to spikes in hateful and violent content, as it did on Jan 6. The company said it´s not responsible for the actions of the rioters and that having stricter controls in place prior to that day wouldn´t have helped. Facebook´s decisions to phase certain safety measures in or out took into account signals from the Facebook platform as well as information from law enforcement, said spokeswoman Dani Lever. 'When those signals changed, so did the measures.' Lever said some of the measures stayed in place well into February and others remain active today. Some employees were unhappy with Facebook's managing of problematic content even before the Jan. 6 riots. One employee who departed the company in 2020 left a long note charging that promising new tools, backed by strong research, were being constrained by Facebook for 'fears of public and policy stakeholder responses' (translation: concerns about negative reactions from Trump allies and investors). Videos of rioters entering the Capitol building often went viral themselves through the social media giant Facebook was founded in 2004, originally meant to be used as network of Harvard University students Research conducted by Facebook well before the 2020 campaign left little doubt that its algorithm could pose a serious danger of spreading misinformation and potentially radicalizing users 'Similarly (though even more concerning), I´ve seen already built & functioning safeguards being rolled back for the same reasons,' wrote the employee, whose name is blacked out. Research conducted by Facebook well before the 2020 campaign left little doubt that its algorithm could pose a serious danger of spreading misinformation and potentially radicalizing users. One 2019 study, entitled 'Carol´s Journey to QAnon-A Test User Study of Misinfo & Polarization Risks Encountered through Recommendation Systems,' described results of an experiment conducted with a test account established to reflect the views of a prototypical 'strong conservative' - but not extremist - 41-year North Carolina woman. This test account, using the fake name Carol Smith, indicated a preference for mainstream news sources like Fox News, followed humor groups that mocked liberals, embraced Christianity and was a fan of Melania Trump. Within a single day, page recommendations for this account generated by Facebook itself had evolved to a 'quite troubling, polarizing state,' the study found. By day 2, the algorithm was recommending more extremist content, including a QAnon-linked group, which the fake user didn´t join because she wasn't innately drawn to conspiracy theories. A week later the test subject's feed featured 'a barrage of extreme, conspiratorial and graphic content,' including posts reviving the false Obama birther lie and linking the Clintons to the murder of a former Arkansas state senator. Much of the content was pushed by dubious groups run from abroad or by administrators with a track record for violating Facebook´s rules on bot activity. Those results led the researcher, whose name was redacted by the whistleblower, to recommend safety measures running from removing content with known conspiracy references and disabling 'top contributor' badges for misinformation commenters to lowering the threshold number of followers required before Facebook verifies a page administrator´s identity. Among the other Facebook employees who read the research the response was almost universally supportive. 'Hey! This is such a thorough and well-outlined (and disturbing) study,' one user wrote, their name blacked out by the whistleblower. 'Do you know of any concrete changes that came out of this?' Facebook said the study was an one of many examples of its commitment to continually studying and improving its platform. Another study turned over to congressional investigators, titled 'Understanding the Dangers of Harmful Topic Communities,' discussed how like-minded individuals embracing a borderline topic or identity can form 'echo chambers' for misinformation that normalizes harmful attitudes, spurs radicalization and can even provide a justification for violence. Examples of such harmful communities include QAnon and, hate groups promoting theories of a race war. 'The risk of offline violence or harm becomes more likely when like-minded individuals come together and support one another to act,' the study concludes. Charging documents filed by federal prosecutors against those alleged to have stormed the Capitol have examples of such like-minded people coming together. Prosecutors say a reputed leader in the Oath Keepers militia group used Facebook to discuss forming an 'alliance' and coordinating plans with another extremist group, the Proud Boys, ahead of the riot at the Capitol. 'We have decided to work together and shut this s-t down,' Kelly Meggs, described by authorities as the leader of the Florida chapter of the Oath Keepers, wrote on Facebook, according to court records. Facebook needs to change its CEO, not its name: The public has lost trust in the network and the only way to regain it is for Zuckerberg to stand down, professor of communications says A former spokesperson for President Barack Obama's Treasury Department is calling for Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg to resign after more revelations have been made public about the company's failure to stop disinformation. Kara Alaimo, now serving as an associate professor in the Lawrence Herbert School of Communication at Hofstra University, claims that Zuckerberg 'has done little to try to fix' the problems with the social media behemoth. A new whistleblower affidavit submitted by a former Facebook employee accuses the social media giant of prioritizing profits over their due diligence to combat hate speech, misinformation and other threats to the public. The new allegations, submitted anonymously under penalty of perjury, echoed the claims made by fellow whistleblower Frances Haugen, who delivered a scathing testimony before Congress this month on Facebook's moral failings. Kara Alaimo, now serving as an associate professor in the Lawrence Herbert School of Communication at Hofstra University, says that the first step to fixing problems at Facebook would be for CEO Mark Zuckerberg to resign Zuckerberg, who founded Facebook, has a net worth is $122 billion, making him the 5th-richest person in the world In the most dramatic line of the affidavit, the former employee anguished over Facebook's inability to act quickly to help curb racial killings in Myanmar in 2017 as military officials used the site to spread hate speech. The op-ed comes as Facebook considers changing the company's name after all the bad publicity. The company is also hinting at plans for a so-called 'metaverse' - a virtual reality version of the internet where people can game, work and communicate. The tech giant's CEO Mark Zuckerberg has been a leading voice on the concept, which would blur the lines between the physical world and the digital one. It could allow someone to don a virtual reality headset to make them feel as if they're face-to-face with a friend, despite being thousands of miles apart and connected via the internet. Whistleblower Frances Haugen delivered a scathing testimony before Congress earlier this month on Facebook's moral failings. Alaimo says the company needs much more than a cosmetic change. 'The place to start is with Zuckerberg's resignation,' she wrote in the op-ed. Zuckerberg, Alaimo said, either can't fix Facebook's issues or won't. 'It's clear that he lacks the moral inclination or the capacity to solve these problems,' she wrote. 'Either way, he's got to go. The company should announce a new chief executive with all possible haste. It should be someone thoughtful and committed to transparency about how social media is harming our society -- who has the will and competence to put the platform on a very different course.' Simply put, Alaimo argues Zuckerberg's company, which has nearly three billion users, has lost the public trust. 'It's because the public has lost faith in Facebook. And rightly so. For all the family photos shared or funny videos consumed that the company has made possible, 'Facebook' is now also a name associated in recent years with misinformation, privacy violations, the spread of hate and autocracy.' Alaimo calls Facebook's reputation 'bankrupt' and says the name will do little to restore public trust. Haugen has said that Facebook holds culpability for the January 6 Capitol insurrection The company said it more or less 'stumbled' onto the riot, which resulted in the deaths of five people As the world begins to truly contend with just how dangerous social media platforms can be, Facebook's reckoning has been kicked into overdrive following former staffer Frances Haugen's shocking allegations that the company has long known about its platform's toxic effects on society -- and has done little to try to fix them. 'The only way for Facebook to restore that trust is to change its leadership and address the actual issues that have justifiably prompted so much concern.' This is the first time the company has faced such accusations since the internal memos released and testimony given by Haugen. Haugen and the new whistleblower also submitted the allegations to the Securities and Exchange Commission, which oversees all publicly traded companies. In the SEC affidavit, the anonymous ex-employee alleges that Facebook officials routinely undermined efforts within the company to fight misinformation and hate speech out of fear of angering then-President Donald Trump and his allies. The former employee said that on one occasion, Facebook's Public Policy team defended a 'white list' that exempted the alt-right media company Breitbart News and other Trump-aligned publishers from Facebook's ordinary rules against spreading fake news. Alaimo says 'he company should announce a new chief executive with all possible haste' Facebook is blamed by Haugen as knowing Instagram harmed young girls' body image and even tried to brainstorm ways to appeal to toddlers by 'exploring playdates as a growth lever.' Ultimately, Alaimo argues, 'changing a name won't change reality.' The complaints come after Haugen's testimony before Congress in early October, where she claimed Facebook promoted divisiveness as a way to keep people on the site, with Haugen saying the documents showed the company had failed to protect young users. It also showed that the company knew Instagram harmed young girls' body image and even tried to brainstorm ways to appeal to toddlers by 'exploring playdates as a growth lever.' 'The company's leadership knows how to make Facebook and Instagram safer, but won't make the necessary changes because they have put their astronomical profits before people. Congressional action is needed,' Haugen said at a hearing. Haugen, who anonymously filed eight complaints about her former employer with the US Securities and Exchange Commission, told 60 Minutes earlier this month: 'Facebook, over and over again, has shown it chooses profit over safety.' She claimed that a 2018 change prioritizing divisive posts, which made Facebook users argue, was found to boost user engagement. That in turn helped bosses sell more online ads that have seen the social media giant's value pass $1 trillion. 'You are forcing us to take positions that we don't like, that we know are bad for society. We know if we don't take those positions, we won't win in the marketplace of social media,' Haugen said. She also blamed Facebook for spurring the January 6 Capitol riot."", ""A former spokesperson for President Barack Obama's Treasury Department is calling for Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg to resign after more revelations have been made public about the company's failure to stop disinformation.

She also blamed Facebook for spurring the January 6 Capitol riot. 'We've been fueling this fire for a long time': Facebook employees raged as they scrambled to delete posts that incited violence on Jan 6 - but the firm didn't allow them to target some groups calling for violence Whistleblowers at social media giant Facebook are saying the company didn't do enough to stop the spread of misinformation in the days and weeks leading up to, as well as during, the Capitol riot on January 6. New internal documents provided by former Facebook employee-turned-whistleblower Frances Haugen provide a rare glimpse into how the company appears to have simply stumbled into the Jan. 6 riot. Reports say that in California, Facebook engineers were racing to tweak internal controls to slow the spread of misinformation and inciteful content. Emergency actions - some of which were rolled back after the 2020 election - included banning Trump, freezing comments in groups with a record for hate speech, filtering out the 'Stop the Steal' rallying cry and empowering content moderators to act more assertively by labeling the U.S. a 'Temporary High Risk Location' for political violence. At the same time, frustration inside Facebook erupted over what some saw as the company's halting and often reversed response to rising extremism in the U.S. Former Facebook employee Frances Haugen (pictured above) has provided new details on the company's response to the Capitol riot Five people died in the insurrection, which attempted to stop American electors from certifying the 2020 Presidential Election for Joe Biden Within Facebook, there were complaints that the company hadn't done enough to stop the spread of misinformation extremism that people believe led to the riots 'Haven´t we had enough time to figure out how to manage discourse without enabling violence?' one employee wrote on an internal message board at the height of the Jan. 6 turmoil. 'We´ve been fueling this fire for a long time and we shouldn´t be surprised it´s now out of control.' It´s a question that still hangs over the company today, as Congress and regulators investigate Facebook´s part in the Jan. 6 riots. It quickly became clear that even after years under the microscope for insufficiently policing its platform, the social network had missed how riot participants spent weeks vowing - on Facebook itself - to stop Congress from certifying Joe Biden´s election victory. The documents also appear to bolster Haugen´s claim that Facebook put its growth and profits ahead of public safety, opening the clearest window yet into how Facebook´s conflicting impulses - to safeguard its business and protect democracy - clashed in the days and weeks leading up to the attempted Jan. 6 coup. This story is based in part on disclosures Haugen made to the Securities and Exchange Commission and provided to Congress in redacted form by Haugen´s legal counsel. The redacted versions received by Congress were obtained by a consortium of news organizations, including The Associated Press. What Facebook called 'Break the Glass' emergency measures put in place on Jan. 6 were essentially a toolkit of options designed to stem the spread of dangerous or violent content that the social network had first used in the run-up to the bitter 2020 election. As many as 22 of those measures were rolled back at some point after the election, according to an internal spreadsheet analyzing the company's response. 'As soon as the election was over, they turned them back off or they changed the settings back to what they were before, to prioritize growth over safety,' Haugen said in an interview with '60 Minutes.' A Capitol police officer was one of the five people who died as a result of the riot New internal documents provided by former Facebook employee-turned-whistleblower Frances Haugen provide a rare glimpse into how the company, after years under the microscope for the policing of its platform, appears to have simply stumbled into the Jan. 6 riot Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg has faced heavy criticism for how his platform controls information and data An internal Facebook report following Jan. 6, previously reported by BuzzFeed, faulted the company for having a 'piecemeal' approach to the rapid growth of 'Stop the Steal' pages, related misinformation sources, and violent and inciteful comments. Facebook says the situation is more nuanced and that it carefully calibrates its controls to react quickly to spikes in hateful and violent content, as it did on Jan 6. The company said it´s not responsible for the actions of the rioters and that having stricter controls in place prior to that day wouldn´t have helped. Facebook´s decisions to phase certain safety measures in or out took into account signals from the Facebook platform as well as information from law enforcement, said spokeswoman Dani Lever. 'When those signals changed, so did the measures.' Lever said some of the measures stayed in place well into February and others remain active today. Some employees were unhappy with Facebook's managing of problematic content even before the Jan. 6 riots. One employee who departed the company in 2020 left a long note charging that promising new tools, backed by strong research, were being constrained by Facebook for 'fears of public and policy stakeholder responses' (translation: concerns about negative reactions from Trump allies and investors). Videos of rioters entering the Capitol building often went viral themselves through the social media giant Facebook was founded in 2004, originally meant to be used as network of Harvard University students Research conducted by Facebook well before the 2020 campaign left little doubt that its algorithm could pose a serious danger of spreading misinformation and potentially radicalizing users 'Similarly (though even more concerning), I´ve seen already built & functioning safeguards being rolled back for the same reasons,' wrote the employee, whose name is blacked out. Research conducted by Facebook well before the 2020 campaign left little doubt that its algorithm could pose a serious danger of spreading misinformation and potentially radicalizing users. One 2019 study, entitled 'Carol´s Journey to QAnon-A Test User Study of Misinfo & Polarization Risks Encountered through Recommendation Systems,' described results of an experiment conducted with a test account established to reflect the views of a prototypical 'strong conservative' - but not extremist - 41-year North Carolina woman. This test account, using the fake name Carol Smith, indicated a preference for mainstream news sources like Fox News, followed humor groups that mocked liberals, embraced Christianity and was a fan of Melania Trump. Within a single day, page recommendations for this account generated by Facebook itself had evolved to a 'quite troubling, polarizing state,' the study found. By day 2, the algorithm was recommending more extremist content, including a QAnon-linked group, which the fake user didn´t join because she wasn't innately drawn to conspiracy theories. A week later the test subject's feed featured 'a barrage of extreme, conspiratorial and graphic content,' including posts reviving the false Obama birther lie and linking the Clintons to the murder of a former Arkansas state senator. Much of the content was pushed by dubious groups run from abroad or by administrators with a track record for violating Facebook´s rules on bot activity. Those results led the researcher, whose name was redacted by the whistleblower, to recommend safety measures running from removing content with known conspiracy references and disabling 'top contributor' badges for misinformation commenters to lowering the threshold number of followers required before Facebook verifies a page administrator´s identity. Among the other Facebook employees who read the research the response was almost universally supportive. 'Hey! This is such a thorough and well-outlined (and disturbing) study,' one user wrote, their name blacked out by the whistleblower. 'Do you know of any concrete changes that came out of this?' Facebook said the study was an one of many examples of its commitment to continually studying and improving its platform. Another study turned over to congressional investigators, titled 'Understanding the Dangers of Harmful Topic Communities,' discussed how like-minded individuals embracing a borderline topic or identity can form 'echo chambers' for misinformation that normalizes harmful attitudes, spurs radicalization and can even provide a justification for violence. Examples of such harmful communities include QAnon and, hate groups promoting theories of a race war. 'The risk of offline violence or harm becomes more likely when like-minded individuals come together and support one another to act,' the study concludes. Charging documents filed by federal prosecutors against those alleged to have stormed the Capitol have examples of such like-minded people coming together. Prosecutors say a reputed leader in the Oath Keepers militia group used Facebook to discuss forming an 'alliance' and coordinating plans with another extremist group, the Proud Boys, ahead of the riot at the Capitol. 'We have decided to work together and shut this s-t down,' Kelly Meggs, described by authorities as the leader of the Florida chapter of the Oath Keepers, wrote on Facebook, according to court records.""]"

The gesture is a symbol of resistance inspired by the Hunger Games film franchise, which takes place in a dystopian world whose characters live under a brutal totalitarian government that severely restricts their rights. The salute was first taken up by Thai protesters opposing a 2014 military coup and has been a noticeable feature of pro-democracy demonstrations in the country ever since, including mass rallies last year. Myanmarese protesters have now adopted the symbol of resistance at huge demonstrations against last Monday's arrest of de-facto civilian leader Aung San Suu Kyi and other top officials.

Aside from the Myawaddy incident, the protests have been peaceful. Backed by a din of car horns, tens of thousands of changing protesters in Yangon, the largest city, held up banners reading 'Justice for Myanmar' and 'We do not want military dictatorship', while others waved the signature red flags of Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy (NLD) party. Many of those present wore red t-shirts and carried red balloons in support of the NLD, chanting: 'We don't want military dictatorship! We want democracy!' Many protesters have flashed a three-fingered salute from the Hunger Games movie franchise. The salute was first adopted by pro-democracy demonstrators in Thailand in 2014.

Later on Sunday, Reuters news agency reported that the internet had been restored in Yangon, citing residents. There was no comment from the military in the capital Naypyitaw, more than 350 km (220 miles) north of Yangon.

Pictured: Protesters during a demonstration in Yangon on Sunday Online calls to protest have prompted bold displays of defiance, including the nightly deafening clamour of people banging pots and pans - a practice traditionally associated in the country with driving out evil spirits. There was a smaller protest in Mandalay, Myanmar's second-largest city while a crowd of hundreds spent the night outside a police station in the town of Payathonzu in Karen state in the southeast, where they believed local NLD lawmakers had been arrested. There were also protests in other Asian countries, with some 300 people gathering at the United Nations office in Bangkok and Sunday, prompting Thai authorities to deploy riot police though there were no reports of clashes. The coup last Monday took the international community by surprise.

Pictured: A policeman holds flowers given to him by a protester in Yangon Speaking on Sunday before reports of internet restrictions being lifted in Yangon, monitoring group Netblocks said that Myanmar 'remains in the midst of a nation-scale internet blackout', with connectivity at 14 percent of usual levels. Tom Anders, UN special rapporteur on human rights in Myanmar said: 'The generals are now attempting to paralyse the citizen movement of resistance - and keep the outside world in the dark - by cutting virtually all internet access.' Dozens have been detained so far, in addition to Suu Kyi, 75, and her top aides. The precise number of arrests is not yet known, but monitoring group Assistance Association for Political Prisoners said on Saturday that more than 150 people were still in custody. Rumours that Suu Kyi had been released triggered brief but raucous street celebrations among her supporters on Saturday, before they were denied by her lawyer who said Suu Kyi remained in detention and he has not been able to see her.

She remains an immensely popular figure at home despite a tarnished reputation abroad. Suu Kyi was sharply criticised for failing to condemn the military's brutal crackdown on the Rohingya ethnic minority. In 2019 she lost what remaining credibility she had among the international community when she defended the military at an International Criminal Court hearing into atrocities against the Rohingyas in 2017.

The military had hinted at its coup intentions days in advance, with army commander Min Aung Hlaing insisting that the NLD's landslide victory in November elections was the result of voter fraud. Following the takeover, the junta proclaimed a one-year state of emergency after which it promised to hold fresh elections, without offering any precise timeframe. The coup took the international community by surprise, with Myanmar watchers expecting those in power to be too consumed with managing the coronavirus pandemic and the country's struggling economy to act on fractures with the NLD. Many countries were quick to condemn the power grab, with US President Joe Biden leading calls for the generals to relinquish power and release those arrested in the post-coup crackdown.

Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said he will leave office once a new government is in place, hours before the speaker of the Sri Lankan parliament said President Gotabaya Rajapaksa would step down on Wednesday. Hundreds of thousands of people massed in the capital Colombo to demand the government take responsibility for mismanaging the nation\'s finances, and for crippling food and fuel shortages. Police had attempted to thwart promised protests with a curfew, then lifted it as lawyers and opposition politicians denounced it as illegal. After storming the gates of the presidential palace, a throng of protesters walked through its rooms, with some among the boisterous crowd jumping into the compound\'s pool.

July 1: New inflation record The government publishes data showing inflation has hit a record high for the ninth consecutive month, a day after the IMF asks Sri Lanka to rein in high prices and galloping inflation. July 9: President\'s home stormed President Rajapaksa flees his official residence in Colombo with the assistance of troops, shortly before demonstrators storm the compound, and he is taken to an undisclosed location offshore. Footage from inside the residence shows jubilant protesters jumping in the pool and exploring its stately bedrooms. Wickremesinghe\'s residence is set on fire. Police say he and his family were not at the scene. Rajapaksa later offers to step down on July 13, parliamentary speaker Mahinda Abeywardana says in a televised statement. Advertisement Rajapaksa had to be extracted from his residence by troops who fired into the air to keep the crowd outside at bay. Soon after they stormed the presidential palace, Rajapaksa\'s nearby seafront office also fell into the hands of protesters. No casualties have been reported in the fire so far, and police said Wickremesinghe and his family were away at the time. Security forces attempted to disperse the huge crowds that had mobbed Colombo\'s administrative district earlier in the day, with dozens injured in the resulting clashes. A spokeswoman for Colombo\'s main hospital said three people were being treated for gunshot wounds, along with 36 others suffering breathing difficulties after being caught up in tear gas barrages. The fire came hours after the Prime Minister he said he would resign over a worsening economic crisis. In videos on social media, red smoke can be seen rising into the sky, as flames take hold. The office of Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said the protesters forced their way into his Colombo home on Saturday evening. He said earlier that he will resign only when all parties have agreed on a new government. He was responding to a call by leaders of political parties represented in Parliament that he and President Gotabaya Rajapaksa quit, after tens of thousands of people trooped to the capital to vent their fury at the leaders they hold responsible for the nation\'s worst economic and political crisis. \'Today in this country we have a fuel crisis, a food shortage, we have the head of the World Food Program coming here and we have several matters to discuss with the IMF. Therefore, if this government leaves there should be another government,\' he said. But he made it clear he will not step down before a new government is formed, angering crowds that moved near his home to force him to leave office immediately. Two defence ministry sources said President Gotabaya Rajapaksa was removed from the official premises on Friday for his safety ahead of the planned rally over the weekend, with government spokesman Mohan Samaranayake unsure of Rajapaksa\'s whereabouts. The island of 22 million people is struggling under a severe foreign exchange shortage that has limited essential imports of fuel, food and medicine, plunging it into the worst economic crisis since independence in 1948. Many blame the country\'s decline on President Gotabaya Rajapaksa, as it muddles through with aid from India and other countries and its leaders try to negotiate a bailout with the International Monetary Fund. The president\'s older brother resigned as prime minister in May after violent protests saw him seek safety at a naval base, while three other Rajapaksa relatives had quit their Cabinet posts earlier. Much of the public ire has been pointed at the Rajapaksa family, with protesters blaming them for dragging Sri Lanka into chaos with poor management and allegations of corruption and nepotism. A new prime minister, Ranil Wickremesinghe, took over in May to help steer the country out of the crisis. Meanwhile, Rajapaksa has held on to power despite largely peaceful protests since March demanding his resignation. Thousands of people swarmed into Colombo\'s government district, shouting slogans against the president and dismantling several police barricades to reach Rajapaksa\'s house, a witness said. There were even reports that angry protesters from out of town had forced railway staff to run trains to take them to Colombo. Thousands of people broke through barricades and entered President Gotabaya Rajapaksa\'s residence and nearby office to vent their anger against a leader they hold responsible for the nation\'s worst crisis. Footage showed people in a jubilant mood taking a dip in the garden pool of the residence. Some lay on beds, others made tea and drank, and made \'statements\' from the conference room that Rajapaksa and Wickremesinghe must immediately quit. Wickremesinghe said he suggested to the president to have an all-party government, but didn\'t say anything about Rajapaksa\'s whereabouts. Opposition parties in Parliament were currently discussing the formation of a new government. Rajapaksa appointed Wickremesinghe as prime minister in May in the hope that the career politician would use his diplomacy and contacts to resuscitate a collapsed economy. But people\'s patience wore thin as shortages of fuel, medicine and cooking gas only increased and oil reserves ran dry. Many protesters accuse Wickremesinghe of trying to save Rajapaksa when he came under pressure to resign and every other member of his powerful political dynasty quit the Cabinet. Later Saturday evening, protesters to Wickremesinghe\'s home in a bid to force him to quit immediately. Privately-owned Sirasa Television reported that at least six of their staff members including four reporters were hospitalised after they were beaten by police while covering the protest near Wickremesinghe\'s home. Sri Lanka Medical Council, the country\'s top professional body, warned that the country\'s hospitals were running with minimum resources and will not be able to handle any mass casualties from the unrest. Demonstrators have been camped outside the entrance to his office for the past three months. Videos posted on social media showed protesters storming the residence, chanting \'Gota go home,\' calling the president by his nickname. Dozens were seen jumping into the pool, milling about the house and and watching television. Outside the building, barricades were overturned and a black flag was hoisted on a pole. At the president\'s office, security personnel tried to stop demonstrators who pushed through fences to run across the lawns and inside the colonial-era building. Police fired shots in the air but were unable to stop the angry crowd from surrounding the presidential residence and pushing through fences to run across the lawns and inside the colonial-era building. At least 34 people including two police officers were wounded in scuffles as protesters tried to enter the residence. Two of the injured are in critical condition while others sustained minor injuries, said an official at the Colombo National Hospital who spoke on condition of anonymity as he was not authorised to speak to the media. Sri Lanka Medical Council said that the president, prime minister and the government would be held responsible if people died or were maimed. It urged the leaders to heed the cry of the people, resign and hand over the reins to an all-party government.

The fury that Sri Lankans feel towards President Gotabaya Rajapaksa runs deep. Rolling blackouts cut electricity to power fans and air-conditioners, essential items double in price each month, and petrol to fuel tuk-tuks and motorbikes is hard to come by. Sri Lankans must now dedicate enormous quantities of their time to queueing. Queueing for food, queueing for gas, queueing for water. This is on top of their usual working weeks, to earn rupees that are worth less and less. In poorer neighbourhoods, people have taken to banding together and cooking in the street - with the food they can afford and the food they can find. Malnourishment is now a problem in South Asia\'s most developed country. These problems, long-running and ongoing as they are, are put squarely at the door of President Gotabaya Rajapaksa and his family, who have run the country like their own personal business for over a decade. Between Gotabaya and his brother, Mahinda, who was prime minister until he was forced out by violent riots in May, and the other brothers and family members they appointed to governmental posts, they have been accused of a myriad of corruption offences. Ranging from dodgy deals with Chinese state companies to diverting tsunami relief funds and dipping into public coffers to make personal purchases of land, the alleged mismanagement has been egregious. The present prime minister, Ranil Wickremesinghe, revealed that Sri Lanka has less than $1 million in foreign reserves, dwindling medical supplies and almost no fuel. Advertisement It was not clear if Rajapaksa was inside his residence when it was stormed earlier Saturday. A government spokesman, Mohan Samaranayake, said he had no information about his movements. Leaders of political parties in Parliament met later and decided to request Rajapaksa and Wickremesinghe to step down, opposition lawmaker Rauff Hakeem said on Twitter. He said a consensus was reached that the parliamentary speaker should take over as temporary president and work on an interim government. Sri Lanka\'s economy is in a state of collapse, relying on aid from India and other countries as its leaders try to negotiate a bailout with the International Monetary Fund. The economic meltdown has led to severe shortages of essential items, leaving people struggling to buy food, fuel and other necessities. The turmoil has led to months of protests, which have nearly dismantled the Rajapaksa political dynasty that has ruled Sri Lanka for most of the past two decades. With fuel supplies scarce, many protesters crowded onto buses and trains to come to the city to protest, while others made their way on bicycles and on foot. Protest and religious leaders called on Rajapaksa to step down, saying he has lost the people\'s mandate. \'His claim that he was voted in by the Sinhala Buddhists is not valid now,\' said Ven. Omalpe Sobitha, a prominent Buddhist leader. He urged Parliament to convene immediately to select an interim president but said that Wickremesinghe did not enjoy the people\'s support. Protest leaders in their proclamation demanded the resignation of not only the president and the government but all government officials and the country\'s ambassadors. They said that the protesters should have access to governance as a pressure group. Sri Lanka\'s Prime Minister, Ranil Wickremesinghe, has summoned an emergency meeting of political party leaders today in response. Last month, Wickremesinghe said the country\'s economy had collapsed. He said that the negotiations with the IMF have been complex because Sri Lanka was now a bankrupt state. The economic meltdown has led to severe shortages of essential items, leaving people struggling to buy food, fuel and other necessities. The turmoil has led to months of protests, which have nearly dismantled the Rajapaksa political dynasty that has ruled Sri Lanka for most of the past two decades. In April, Sri Lanka announced it is suspending repaying foreign loans due to a foreign currency shortage. Its total foreign debt amounts to $51 billion of which it must repay $28 billion by the end of 2027. Police had imposed a curfew in Colombo and several other main urban areas on Friday night but withdrew it Saturday morning amid objections by lawyers and opposition politicians who called it illegal. U.S. Ambassador to Sri Lanka Julie Chung on Friday asked people to protest peacefully and called for the military and police \'to grant peaceful protesters the space and security to do so.\' Demonstrators run from tear gas used by police during a protest demanding the resignation of President Gotabaya Rajapaksa People at the anti government protest rally near the President\'s house in Colombo call for the resignation of the president over the alleged failure to address the economic crisis Protestors march in an anti-government demonstration outside the Galle International Cricket Stadium in the south of the island during the second day play of the second cricket Test match between Sri Lanka and Australia A demonstrator throws back a tear gas grenade towards police members as police use tear gas and water cannons to disperse demonstrators Police and security troops react to a tear gas cannister that has landed near them \'Chaos & force will not fix the economy or bring the political stability that Sri Lankans need right now,\' Chung said in a tweet. Despite a severe shortage of fuel that has stalled transportation services, demonstrators packed into buses, trains and trucks from several parts of the country to reach Colombo to protest the government\'s failure to protect them from economic ruin. Discontent has worsened in recent weeks as the cash-strapped country stopped receiving fuel shipments, forcing school closures and rationing of petrol and diesel for essential services. Sampath Perera, a 37-year-old fisherman took an overcrowded bus from the seaside town of Negombo 45 km (30 miles) north of Colombo, to join the protest. \'We have told Gota over and over again to go home but he is still clinging onto power. We will not stop until he listens to us,\' Perera said. He is among the millions squeezed by chronic fuel shortages and inflation that hit 54.6% in June. Political instability could undermine Sri Lanka\'s talks with the International Monetary Fund seeking a $3 billion bailout, a restructuring of some foreign debt and fund-raising from multilateral and bilateral sources to ease the dollar drought.', ""More video has emerged overnight of Sri Lankan protestors having fun and enjoying themselves after they stormed the President's House and presidential compound on Saturday - until they set alight to the prime minister's residence. The raucous uprising was enough to force the resignation of Sri Lanka's President and Prime Minister, as months of frustration brought on by an unprecedented economic crisis boiled over. As well as holding an impromptu pool party, the protestors enjoyed a sing-along on the president's grand piano, a pillow fight in the prime minister's bedrooms, and even made time for a spot of weight-lifting in the president's private gym. But the light-hearted high jinx gave way to more ominous anger as a fire was started in the prime minister's private home Temple Trees that burned into the night. The prime minister was not present at the time. Today the protesters are refusing to budge from President Gotabaya Rajapaksa's residence, a day after they stormed his home, forcing him to flee on a navy ship and announce he would resign. 'Our struggle is not over,' student leader Lahiru Weerasekara told reporters the day after Rajapaksa, currently taking refuge on a vessel offshore, said he would step down on Wednesday. 'We won't give up this struggle until he actually leaves.' The prime minister, Ranil Wickremesinghe, said he will leave office once an all-party interim government is in place, hours before the speaker of the Sri Lankan parliament said President Gotabaya Rajapaksa would also step down on Wednesday July 13. Calm had returned to Colombo by the following morning, as Sri Lankans roamed through the ransacked presidential palace a day after protesters had stormed the building. Hundreds of thousands of people had massed in the capital Colombo on Saturday to demand the government take responsibility for mismanaging the nation's finances, and for crippling food and fuel shortages.

The International Monetary Fund (IMF), which has been in talks with the Sri Lankan government for a possible $3 billion bailout, said on Sunday it was monitoring events closely. 'We hope for a resolution of the current situation that will allow for resumption of our dialogue on an IMF-supported programme,' the global lender said in a statement. The political chaos could complicate efforts to pull Sri Lanka out of its worst economic crisis in seven decades, triggered by a severe shortage of foreign currency that has stalled the imports of essentials like fuel, food and medicines. Police had attempted to thwart promised protests with a curfew, then lifted it as lawyers and opposition politicians denounced it as illegal. After storming the gates of the presidential palace, a throng of protesters walked through its rooms, with some among the boisterous crowd jumping into the compound's pool. Others were seen laughing and lounging in the stately bedrooms of the residence, with one pulling out what he claimed was a pair of Rajapaksa's underwear. On Sunday, amazed ordinary folk took the opportunity to inspect the colonial-era building. Members of the security forces, some with assault rifles, stood outside the compound but did not stop people going in. Among those taking a look was 61-year-old handkerchief seller B.M. Chandrawathi, who sauntered into a first-floor bedroom accompanied by her daughter and grandchildren. 'I've never seen a place like this in my life,' Chandrawathi said as she tried out a plush sofa. 'They enjoyed super luxury while we suffered,' she said. 'We were hoodwinked. I wanted my kids and grandkids to see the luxurious lifestyles they were enjoying.'

Footage from inside the residence shows jubilant protesters jumping in the pool and exploring its stately bedrooms. Wickremesinghe's residence is set on fire. Police say he and his family were not at the scene. Rajapaksa later offers to step down on July 13, parliamentary speaker Mahinda Abeywardana says in a televised statement. Advertisement Rajapaksa had to be extracted from his residence by troops who fired into the air to keep the crowd outside at bay. Soon after they stormed the presidential palace, Rajapaksa's nearby seafront office also fell into the hands of protesters. No casualties have been reported in the fire, and police said Wickremesinghe and his family were away at the time. Security forces attempted to disperse the huge crowds that had mobbed Colombo's administrative district earlier in the day, with dozens injured in the resulting clashes. A spokeswoman for Colombo's main hospital said three people were being treated for gunshot wounds, along with 36 others suffering breathing difficulties after being caught up in tear gas barrages. The fire came hours after the Prime Minister he said he would resign over a worsening economic crisis. In videos on social media, red smoke can be seen rising into the sky, as flames take hold. The office of Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said the protesters forced their way into his Colombo home on Saturday evening. He said earlier that he will resign only when all parties have agreed on a new government. He was responding to a call by leaders of political parties represented in Parliament that he and President Gotabaya Rajapaksa quit, after tens of thousands of people trooped to the capital to vent their fury at the leaders they hold responsible for the nation's worst economic and political crisis. 'Today in this country we have a fuel crisis, a food shortage, we have the head of the World Food Program coming here and we have several matters to discuss with the IMF. Therefore, if this government leaves there should be another government,' he said. But he made it clear he will not step down before a new government is formed, angering crowds that moved near his home to force him to leave office immediately. Two defence ministry sources said President Gotabaya Rajapaksa was removed from the official premises on Friday for his safety ahead of the planned rally over the weekend, with government spokesman Mohan Samaranayake unsure of Rajapaksa's whereabouts. The island of 22 million people is struggling under a severe foreign exchange shortage that has limited essential imports of fuel, food and medicine, plunging it into the worst economic crisis since independence in 1948. Many blame the country's decline on President Gotabaya Rajapaksa, as it muddles through with aid from India and other countries and its leaders try to negotiate a bailout with the International Monetary Fund. The president's older brother resigned as prime minister in May after violent protests saw him seek safety at a naval base, while three other Rajapaksa relatives had quit their Cabinet posts earlier. Much of the public ire has been pointed at the Rajapaksa family, with protesters blaming them for dragging Sri Lanka into chaos with poor management and allegations of corruption and nepotism. Ranil Wickremesinghe, took over as prime minister in May to help steer the country out of the crisis. Meanwhile, Rajapaksa has held on to power despite largely peaceful protests since March demanding his resignation. Thousands of people swarmed into Colombo's government district, shouting slogans against the president and dismantling several police barricades to reach Rajapaksa's house, a witness said. There were even reports that angry protesters from out of town had forced railway staff to run trains to take them to Colombo. Thousands of people broke through barricades and entered President Gotabaya Rajapaksa's residence and nearby office to vent their anger against a leader they hold responsible for the nation's worst crisis. Footage showed people in a jubilant mood taking a dip in the garden pool of the residence. Some lay on beds, others made tea and drank, and made 'statements' from the conference room that Rajapaksa and Wickremesinghe must immediately quit. Wickremesinghe said he suggested to the president to have an all-party government, but didn't say anything about Rajapaksa's whereabouts. Opposition parties in Parliament were currently discussing the formation of a new government. Rajapaksa appointed Wickremesinghe as prime minister in May in the hope that the career politician would use his diplomacy and contacts to resuscitate a collapsed economy. But people's patience wore thin as shortages of fuel, medicine and cooking gas only increased and oil reserves ran dry. Many protesters accuse Wickremesinghe of trying to save Rajapaksa when he came under pressure to resign and every other member of his powerful political dynasty quit the Cabinet. Later Saturday evening, protesters to Wickremesinghe's home in a bid to force him to quit immediately. Privately-owned Sirasa Television reported that at least six of their staff members including four reporters were hospitalised after they were beaten by police while covering the protest near Wickremesinghe's home. Sri Lanka Medical Council, the country's top professional body, warned that the country's hospitals were running with minimum resources and will not be able to handle any mass casualties from the unrest. Demonstrators have been camped outside the entrance to his office for the past three months. Videos posted on social media showed protesters storming the residence, chanting 'Gota go home,' calling the president by his nickname. Dozens were seen jumping into the pool, milling about the house and and watching television. Outside the building, barricades were overturned and a black flag was hoisted on a pole. At the president's office, security personnel tried to stop demonstrators who pushed through fences to run across the lawns and inside the colonial-era building. Police fired shots in the air but were unable to stop the angry crowd from surrounding the presidential residence and pushing through fences to run across the lawns and inside the colonial-era building. At least 34 people including two police officers were wounded in scuffles as protesters tried to enter the residence. Two of the injured are in critical condition while others sustained minor injuries, said an official at the Colombo National Hospital who spoke on condition of anonymity as he was not authorised to speak to the media. Sri Lanka Medical Council said that the president, prime minister and the government would be held responsible if people died or were maimed. It urged the leaders to heed the cry of the people, resign and hand over the reins to an all-party government.

Built in 1804, it was previously the residence of the British Governor and Governors-General and was known as the 'King's House' or the 'Queen's House' until Sri Lanka became a republic in 1972.

The fury that Sri Lankans feel towards President Gotabaya Rajapaksa runs deep. Rolling blackouts cut electricity to power fans and air-conditioners, essential items double in price each month, and petrol to fuel tuk-tuks and motorbikes is hard to come by. Sri Lankans must now dedicate enormous quantities of their time to queueing. Queueing for food, queueing for gas, queueing for water. This is on top of their usual working weeks, to earn rupees that are worth less and less. In poorer neighbourhoods, people have taken to banding together and cooking in the street - with the food they can afford and the food they can find. Malnourishment is now a problem in South Asia's most developed country. These problems, long-running and ongoing as they are, are put squarely at the door of President Gotabaya Rajapaksa and his family, who have run the country like their own personal business for over a decade. Between Gotabaya and his brother, Mahinda, who was prime minister until he was forced out by violent riots in May, and the other brothers and family members they appointed to governmental posts, they have been accused of a myriad of corruption offences. Ranging from dodgy deals with Chinese state companies to diverting tsunami relief funds and dipping into public coffers to make personal purchases of land, the alleged mismanagement has been egregious. The present prime minister, Ranil Wickremesinghe, revealed that Sri Lanka has less than $1 million in foreign reserves, dwindling medical supplies and almost no fuel. Advertisement It was not clear if Rajapaksa was inside his residence when it was stormed earlier Saturday. A government spokesman, Mohan Samaranayake, said he had no information about his movements. Leaders of political parties in Parliament met later and decided to request Rajapaksa and Wickremesinghe to step down, opposition lawmaker Rauff Hakeem said on Twitter. He said a consensus was reached that the parliamentary speaker should take over as temporary president and work on an interim government. Sri Lanka's economy is in a state of collapse, relying on aid from India and other countries as its leaders try to negotiate a bailout with the International Monetary Fund. The economic meltdown has led to severe shortages of essential items, leaving people struggling to buy food, fuel and other necessities. The turmoil has led to months of protests, which have nearly dismantled the Rajapaksa political dynasty that has ruled Sri Lanka for most of the past two decades. With fuel supplies scarce, many protesters crowded onto buses and trains to come to the city to protest, while others made their way on bicycles and on foot. Protest and religious leaders called on Rajapaksa to step down, saying he has lost the people's mandate. 'His claim that he was voted in by the Sinhala Buddhists is not valid now,' said Ven. Omalpe Sobitha, a prominent Buddhist leader. He urged Parliament to convene immediately to select an interim president but said that Wickremesinghe did not enjoy the people's support. Protest leaders in their proclamation demanded the resignation of not only the president and the government but all government officials and the country's ambassadors. They said that the protesters should have access to governance as a pressure group. Sri Lanka's Prime Minister, Ranil Wickremesinghe, has summoned an emergency meeting of political party leaders today in response. Last month, Wickremesinghe said the country's economy had collapsed. He said that the negotiations with the IMF have been complex because Sri Lanka was now a bankrupt state. The economic meltdown has led to severe shortages of essential items, leaving people struggling to buy food, fuel and other necessities. The turmoil has led to months of protests, which have nearly dismantled the Rajapaksa political dynasty that has ruled Sri Lanka for most of the past two decades. In April, Sri Lanka announced it is suspending repaying foreign loans due to a foreign currency shortage. Its total foreign debt amounts to $51 billion of which it must repay $28 billion by the end of 2027. Police had imposed a curfew in Colombo and several other main urban areas on Friday night but withdrew it Saturday morning amid objections by lawyers and opposition politicians who called it illegal. U.S. Ambassador to Sri Lanka Julie Chung on Friday asked people to protest peacefully and called for the military and police 'to grant peaceful protesters the space and security to do so.' Demonstrators run from tear gas used by police during a protest demanding the resignation of President Gotabaya Rajapaksa People at the anti government protest rally near the President's house in Colombo call for the resignation of the president over the alleged failure to address the economic crisis Protestors march in an anti-government demonstration outside the Galle International Cricket Stadium in the south of the island during the second day play of the second cricket Test match between Sri Lanka and Australia A demonstrator throws back a tear gas grenade towards police members as police use tear gas and water cannons to disperse demonstrators Police and security troops react to a tear gas cannister that has landed near them 'Chaos & force will not fix the economy or bring the political stability that Sri Lankans need right now,' Chung said in a tweet. Despite a severe shortage of fuel that has stalled transportation services, demonstrators packed into buses, trains and trucks from several parts of the country to reach Colombo to protest the government's failure to protect them from economic ruin. Discontent has worsened in recent weeks as the cash-strapped country stopped receiving fuel shipments, forcing school closures and rationing of petrol and diesel for essential services. Sampath Perera, a 37-year-old fisherman took an overcrowded bus from the seaside town of Negombo 45 km (30 miles) north of Colombo, to join the protest. 'We have told Gota over and over again to go home but he is still clinging onto power. We will not stop until he listens to us,' Perera said. He is among the millions squeezed by chronic fuel shortages and inflation that hit 54.6% in June. Political instability could undermine Sri Lanka's talks with the International Monetary Fund seeking a $3 billion bailout, a restructuring of some foreign debt and fund-raising from multilateral and bilateral sources to ease the dollar drought.""]"
