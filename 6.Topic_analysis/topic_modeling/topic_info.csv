The masked young man, who is being searched for by the Metropolitan Police today for the vandalism in Parliament Square, claimed that Mr Churchill only fought the Nazis to protect the empire - not for \'people of colour\'. Using black spray paint yesterday he daubed the phrase \'was racist\' below the wartime leader\'s name, leaving the monument reading: \'Churchill was a racist\'. A \'f*** your agenda\' was also added on the stone. After leaving Parliament Square last night he spoke to a BBC reporter and : \'I tagged up the statue of Churchill because he\'s a confirmed racist. He fought the Nazis to protect the Commonwealth from invasion - he didn\'t do it for black people or for people of colour or for people of anything. He did it sheerly for colonialism. People will be angry - but I\'m angry that for many years we have been oppressed\'. He added; You can\'t enslave people, have the largest colonial empire in history and be like \'Yeah let\'s be peaceful - let\'s talk\'. It don\'t work like that. We\'re p***ed off. F**k that\'. He also that people from BAME backgrounds who fought in the Second World War are not properly recognised for their sacrifices. Critics have flagged the Twitter video to the Met Police to help their investigation - but his supporters have urged the BBC reporter to delete it in case it led detectives to him accusing him of putting the graffiti artist \'at risk\'. It came as a group of volunteers including four Army cadets cleaned up the memorial to Winston Churchill with their own cleaning products in London this morning. One, a warehouse worker called Max, 25, who had just finished a night shift and went to Saturday\'s protests, also cleaned up, telling MailOnline he went there because it \'just felt like it was the right thing to do.\' A professional cleaner - remarkably called Winston - also turned up to do the job professionally after a group of Tory MPs started scrubbing the plinth before English Heritage officers told them to stop because they \'would end up doing more damage\'. Fears of a second wave of coronavirus were sparked today after thousands of Black Lives Matters protesters defied pleas from the government to not gather in groups and took to the streets across Britain over the weekend. Professor Keith Neal, an epidemiologist at Nottingham University, told MailOnline the protests are \'not going to help keep transmission down\'. As the row over Black Lives Matter protests continued today, it also emerged: Boris Johnson insists Britain isn\'t a racist country while Home Secretary Priti Patel vowed to bring violent protesters to \'justice\' for attacking police in London and tearing down the Edward Colston statue in Bristol. 17 suspects have been identified by Avon and Somerset Police but there have been no arrests; Policing minister Kit Malthouse there would need to be a \'post-mortem\' into how the anti-racism protests across the weekend were enforced - but it was not practical to arrest all those who took part for breaking coronavirus-related restrictions; Met Police Chief Cressida Dick she is \'depressed\' by the BLM disturbances and : \'The violent criminality we saw is disgraceful and will have been frightening\' Bristol\'s Mayor Marvin Rees he is in \'no rush\' to fish out the Edward Colston statue and when it is pulled from the dock it will probably go to a museum rather than be put back; Sir Keir Starmer has the toppling of a slave trader statue during Black Lives Matter protests in Bristol was \'completely wrong\' - but adds the statue should have been removed some time ago; Activists stand around the Churchill statue yesterday after it was daubed in graffiti during the Black Lives Matter protests A group of young men of remove graffiti from a statue of Winston Churchill at Parliament Square in London this morning The graffiti artist\'s supporters have called for the BBC to delete their video of his interview in case it leads police to him Demonstrators raise their fists in the air after climbing onto the statue in Parliament Square during the Black Lives Matters protest on Sunday A protester is placed in a spit hood as he is restrained by Police Officers close to Westminster tube station yesterday A workman takes away the damaged Union flag today from the Cenotaph after a Black Lives Matter protester tried to burn it down during yesterday\'s demonstrations that turned violent in central London Fears of a coronavirus spike across the UK after thousands attend Black Lives Matters protests as top experts warn ANY mass gathering risks spreading the virus Fears of a second wave of coronavirus were sparked today after thousands of Black Lives Matters protesters defied pleas from the government to not gather in groups and took to the streets across Britain over the weekend. Leading infectious disease experts have warned any mass gathering risks \'significant numbers of further cases\', with the infection known to spread rapidly among tightly-packed crowds. Professor Keith Neal, an epidemiologist at Nottingham University, told MailOnline the protests — prompted by the murder of George Floyd by police in Minneapolis — are \'not going to help keep transmission down\'. Britain\'s Covid-19 outbreak has slowed drastically in the past month. Just 55 deaths were recorded today — the lowest daily toll since before Boris Johnson imposed the lockdown on March 23 to contain the crisis. Top scientists have already voiced concerns about Number 10\'s plans to start easing lockdown, including allowing groups of up to six people to meet. They the virus is still circulating at dangerous levels in the community. Huge crowds like those which formed in London and Bristol over the weekend could be a fertile breeding ground for the coronavirus if people attending are carrying the bug, experts . Professor Neal, who has studied viruses such as SARS for three decades, : \'We will have to wait to see if one of the marches turns into a super-spreading event.\' Advertisement It came as the clean-up also began in Bristol as council crews removed BLM placards and used chemicals and spray to clean graffit off the plinth from which the statue of slave trader Edward Colston was torn down yesterday. Speaking to MailOnline today, Max : \'For me it was a decision I made last night. I worked during a long night shift and I received the news that the statue was being defaced. I just felt like it was the right thing to do. \'It was completely independent, I thought to myself I\'d be the only one there. I didn\'t mean to antagonise or upset anyone to do it. When I got there I was pleased to see four young Army cadets already cleaning the statue. \'I did actually attend the Black Lives Matter protest on Saturday in support of the movement. I feel strongly to show solidarity. I understand the actions that carried on late into last night were that of a minority. \'But I will not have war memorials defaced. The violence and to see the anger and hatred towards the police was very, very hard to watch for me. It came to standing up for what\'s right.\' Max added: \'We brought our own cleaning products and they weren\'t really up to the job. We only left because remarkably a gentleman called Winston asked us to stop because he\'d been asked to do the job professionally.\' Priti Patel today vowed to bring violent Black Lives Matter protesters to \'justice\' for attacking police in London and tearing down the Edward Colston statue in Bristol as Labour MPs backed its destruction - but police officers battling the activists in the streets their bosses have got their tactics \'completely wrong\'. The Home Secretary that the UK demonstrations following the murder of George Floyd by police in Minneapolis had been \'subverted by thuggery\' and told those responsible: \'Justice will follow\'. She told the Commons this afternoon: \'We strongly support the right to protest peacefully but that does not extend to the violent behaviour that we have witnessed across the country throughout the weekend. And when it comes to any assault on our brave police that is completely unacceptable. Any perpetrator should be in absolutely no doubt that they will be arrested and prosecuted.\' She added: ‘We are privileged to live in an open, democratic country with many values entrenched not just in our constitution but also in a rules-based system. ‘There is no justification for violence at all. And when it comes to exercising people’s voices and obviously their particular issues and concerns there are many avenues through which those voices and concerns can be raised and made at a local council level. ‘Obviously that is the right way to approach these issues.’ Rank-and-file officers left bloodied by attacks with sticks and rocks have today accused their bosses of allowing \'lawlessness\' to take hold because of public perception instead of allowing them to deal with the attackers \'more robustly\'. In Bristol there have been no arrests at all in relation to the destruction of Colston\'s statue despite 17 suspects being identified and Avon and Somerset Police have they have \'no regrets\' about not stopping it being pulled down and thrown in the city\'s harbour. Boris UK is NOT racist country but government must do more to tackle discrimination Boris Johnson believes Britain is not a racist country and backed police to arrest any Black Lives Matter supporter who attacked officers, defaced Churchill\'s statue or threw Bristol\'s Edward Colston statue into the city\'s harbour, his spokesman today Downing Street has the toppling of the monument to 17th century slave trader Colston yesterday was an \'act of criminal damage\' as Avon and Somerset Police came under fire for not holding anyone over the incident despite admitting it had identified 17 suspects. His spokesman : \'The PM doesn\'t doubt that there continues to be discrimination and racism, but does not agree that this is a racist country. We have made very significant progress on this issue, but there remains more to do and we will not be complacent in our efforts to stamp out racism and discrimination where it happens.\' When asked about the Colston statue\'s destruction he : \'People can campaign for the removal of a statue, but what happened yesterday was a criminal act and when the criminal law is broken that is unacceptable and the police will want to hold to account those responsible\'. Mr Johnson received an update from Met chief Dame Cressida Dick on Sunday night after more disturbances in Westminster, which saw 35 officers injured by rocks and bottles. There were 36 arrests yesterday. \'They have our full support in tackling any violence, vandalism and disorderly behaviour,\' the Prime Minister\'s official spokesman , adding: \'It is completely unacceptable they were subjected to attacks over the weekend\' Advertisement Labour\'s shadow justice secretary David Lammy has compared those who toppled the monument to followers of Martin Luther King and the suffragettes - but it \'should have come down a long time ago in a democratic way\'. He told ITV\'s Good Morning Britain: \'I\'m quite sure that those young people who brought that statue down knew that they would be facing the law but that was a price they were willing to pay and there are many examples throughout history, from Martin Luther King to Harvey Milk, who protested on behalf of gay rights. Many, many men and women following these people and being prepared to break the law because they believed the issue of justice they wanted to shine a light on was a bigger project\'. Since last Wednesday 49 officers in London have been injured but there have only been around 60 arrests - and Ken Marsh, chief of the Met Police Federation, has asked Commissioner Dame Cressida Dick to apologise to her officers and : \'Let me be clear, we as a police service can deal with these outbreaks of disorder, no problems. But it seems we are more concerned about image and perception rather than protecting our brave police officers and maintaining order. \'It\'s sadly now clear – and frankly has been clear for a number of days - that some people are using these protests as an excuse to attack police officers. We have had enough warnings. The tactics being used by the Metropolitan Police are very wrong. And need to be looked at as a matter of urgency.\' In Bristol yesterday a group armed with ropes and tools dragged down the statue of slave trader Edward Colston in a \'premeditated\' act of criminal damage and were then allowed to roll it to the city\'s dock and hurl it into the water. Superintendent Andy Bennett, who was in charge in the city yesterday, he had \'no regrets\' about not intervening as activists dragged the statue down - but conceded that officers were \'duty-bound\' to investigate. He : \'As a police officer, I don\'t get to choose which laws I uphold and which I don\'t. We are duty-bound to investigate this. We know and have identified 17 main offenders in terms of tearing it down and an investigation is underway.\' Avon and Somerset Police chief constable Andy Marsh backed the decision and that had his officers intervened to arrest those responsible there would have been a \'very violent confrontation\'. \'To arrest suspects would likely to lead to injuries to suspects, injuries to officers, and people who were not involved in damaging property being thrown into a very violent confrontation with the police that could have had serious ramifications for the city of Bristol and beyond,\' Mr Marsh . \'Can you imagine scenes of police in Bristol fighting with protesters who were damaging the statue of a man who is reputed to have gathered much of his fortune through the slave trade? \'I think there would have been very serious implications and whilst I certainly do not condone crime or damage of any sort, I fully support the actions of my officers. \'They responded with common sense, sound judgment and in the best interest of public safety.\' A council employee later turned up to clean graffiti from the statue of Winston Churchill at Parliament Square this morning The volunteers brought their own cleaning products as they tried to remove graffiti from the Churchill statue today A protester is pulled away as peaceful demonstrations in the capital turn violent in the wake of the death of George Floyd in the U.S. As the protests descended into chaos, one protester (left and right) was seen climbing on the historic monument The Cenotaph and setting fire to the Union Jack flag Protesters throw statue of Edward Colston into Bristol harbour during a Black Lives Matter protest rally yesterday The chairman of the Police Federation, which represents all officers in England and Wales, has criticised Avon and Somerset Police for its decision not to intervene in a protest in Bristol where a statue of a slave trader was torn down. John Apter told BBC Breakfast: \'To have no police presence there I think sent quite a negative message. I am a police officer so I don\'t support this lawlessness we saw where this statue was ripped down and rolled down the street and pushed into the river because that is not how we do things\'. Max, 25, (above) a warehouse worker who attended the BLM protests on Saturday, he felt compelled to clean the graffiti from Churchill\'s statue this morning In London 22 officers were injured over the weekend on top of 13 last week after being pelted with objects on Whitehall. One activist clambered onto The Cenotaph, the war monument dedicated to the millions of lives lost during the First World War, and set fire to the Union Jack flag, while another gang defaced the monument to Winston Churchill in Westminster and daubed \'was a racist\' on its plinth. Police officers were shown being chased down streets and across bridges by protesters throwing bottles and rocks. One Met Police riot unit tackling the violence tweeted a picture of a boulder thrown at them last night and : \'No it\'s not an asteroid. It\'s one of the many things we had thrown at us last night between Parliament Square and Elephant and Castle. Multiple officers injured from our line alone. Unacceptable\'. Yesterday, one activist even scaled the huge statue to stick a \'Black Lives Matter\' placard to the wartime leader\'s torso. Home Secretary Priti Patel had branded those who had defaced the monument \'repulsive criminals\'. She : \'Winston Churchill is one of the greatest Britons who ever lived. We have him to thank for our very freedom to protest. The vandals who did this are repulsive criminals who I want to see brought to justice.\' Under the Churchill status yesterday, a protester had stuck a sign laying out why they believed he was a racist, saying he called the Indians a \'beastly\' people and supported the use of poison gas against \'uncivilised tribes\'. Some protestors posed for photos in front of the defaced statue and a group of activists took a knee around it in Parliament Square. Four uniformed police stood nearby as the crowd took photographs. Banners with messages such as \'British Colonialism is to Blame\' and \'What if it was your son?\' had been left at the base of the column. A white man later stripped away the banners and walked away as the crowd shouted at him. The area has become a key gathering place for activists demanding racial justice and opposing the Government. The £30,000 statue was unveiled by his widow Clementine in 1973 and created by Ivor Roberts-Jones. Protesters hold placards at the Churchill statue during the Black Lives Matter protest rally in Parliament Square yesterday It is not the first time it has been defaced. In 2000, it was sprayed with red paint to give the appearance of blood dripping from its mouth, while during the 2010 student protests it was defaced and urinated on. It comes after the Prime Minister the anti-racism demonstrations had been \'subverted by thuggery\' after protesters tore down a statue of a slave trader in Bristol and clashed with police in the capital. Scotland Yard 12 people were arrested and eight officers injured in London yesterday, while in Bristol protesters toppled the bronze memorial to slave trader Edward Colston and dumped it into the harbour. Black Lives Matter demonstrations were carried out peacefully for much of yesterday in London, but there were clashes with police on Whitehall, with bottles thrown at officers in one incident near the Cenotaph. Most of yesterday\'s arrests related to public order offences, while one was for criminal damage following an incident at the Cenotaph. Scotland Yard 29 people were arrested and 14 officers were injured on Saturday.

The Duchess of Sussex broke her silence on the murder of George Floyd and gave her support to the Black Lives Matter protests in the US last week during an address to graduating students at Immaculate Heart High School in Los Angeles. She revealed she had not spoken about the death of the 46-year-old black man, who died after white police officer Derek Chauvin put his knee on his neck in Minneapolis on May 25 for nine minutes, before because she had been \'nervous\'. A source told Hello! magazine that the situation \'raised a lot of emotion\' for Meghan, 38, who has opened up in the past about how racism has affected her own family. The Duchess of Sussex broke her silence on the murder of George Floyd last week, declaring that \'black lives matter\' and revealed that she had not spoken about his death before because she had been \'nervous\'. Meghan, 38, gave an address to graduating pupils at her old school, Immaculate Heart High School in Los Angeles (pictured) \'Meghan was excited to be part of the IHHS graduation ceremony, but, after this week, knew there was no way she could speak to a group of compassionate, service-driven young women without addressing George Floyd and the racism that plagues this country,\' they . \'Her heart hurts for the young people that are graduating into a world of uncertainty and injustice. She hopes her words provided a small bit of hope, comfort or inspiration to the school community she cares about so deeply.\' In her poignant six-minute virtual speech delivered to pupils at her former school, Meghan : \'George Floyd\'s life mattered and Breonna Taylor\'s life mattered and Philando Castile\'s life mattered and Tamir Rice\'s life mattered.\' The other three people Meghan mentioned were African Americans killed by US police over the past six years. The Duchess also referred to Los Angeles as the family\'s \'home town\' after moving there with Harry and their son Archie, one. According to the source, Meghan was \'excited to be part of the IHHS graduation ceremony, but, after this week, knew there was no way she could speak to a group of compassionate, service-driven young women without addressing George Floyd and the racism that plagues [the US]\' On speaking out about Mr Floyd, she : \'I wasn\'t sure what I could to you. I wanted to the right thing and I was really nervous that it would get picked apart. And I realised the only wrong thing to is to nothing.\' The video was released to black women\'s lifestyle magazine Essence, which published it on its website saying \'courtesy of Meghan, Duchess of Sussex\'. The Duchess also how the students are \'going to have empathy for those who don\'t see the world through the same lens that you do\', adding: \'With as diverse, vibrant and opened-minded as I know the teachings at Immaculate Heart are, I know you know that black lives matter.\' Meghan also referred to some advice she was given by a teacher aged 15, saying: \'I remember my teacher at the time, one of my teachers, Ms Pollia, to me as I was leaving for a day of volunteering, ""always remember to put other\'s needs above your own fears"". \'And that has stuck with me throughout my entire life and I have thought about it more in the last week than ever before.\' On speaking out about Mr Floyd, Meghan (pictured in South Africa in September) : \'I wasn\'t sure what I could to you. I wanted to the right thing and I was really nervous that it would get picked apart. And I realised the only wrong thing to is to nothing\' Meghan was referring to her former theology teacher, Maria Pollia, who has previously described her as a \'remarkable student\' who was \'very enthusiastic about the material, but always took it a step further\'. Meghan also spoke to the students about their futures, saying: \'You know that you\'re going to rebuild, rebuild and rebuild until it is rebuilt. \'Because when the foundation is broken, so are we. You are going to lead with love, you are going to lead with compassion, you are going to use your voice.\' Her speech left some Immaculate Heart students in tears, with one on Twitter with the user name \'blm • gia\' saying: \'Meghan Markle talking about George Floyd and BLM in my virtual graduation. I\'m crying.\' Yesterday it emerged Harry and Meghan have been \'quietly\' having meetings with key people and organisations linked to the Black Lives Matter movement to \'educate\' themselves. Meghan mentioned three other people who were killed by US police over the past six years during her speech to pupils at her old school. She also referred to Los Angeles as the family\'s \'home town\' after moving there with Harry and their son Archie, one (pictured together in South Africa in September) According to a source, the couple have been having \'private conversations\' with people \'on all levels\' to ensure they are \'connected to the issues of police brutality and the Black Lives Matter movement\'. They told Harper\'s Bazaar\'s royal editor Omid Scobie: \'Harry and Meghan have been having private conversations with community leaders and people at every level, to ensure that they understand current events. \'This is something that is incredibly personal to Meghan, especially given everything she has experienced. And as a couple, it is, of course, very important. They are both feeling it, just like the rest of us.\' Meghan has previously described the experiences of both her mother and grandfather, and her own journey as a biracial woman. Protests have taken place across America and beyond after white police officer Derek Chauvin (seen right) knelt on unarmed George Floyd\'s neck for eight minutes and 46 seconds last week, despite Floyd\'s desperate repeated pleas for help crying, \'I can\'t breathe\'. Floyd (left and right) passed out and later died The former Suits star became the first mixed-race person in modern history to marry a senior British royal, in 2018. But Meghan and the Duke of Sussex quit as senior working royals in March to pursue personal and financial freedom in the US, after telling of their struggles dealing with their royal life and the intense media interest. The American ex-actress recounted, before marrying into the Windsor family, how her grandfather told her as a child that he and his family stopped off at Kentucky Fried Chicken during a road trip, but had to go to the back of the restaurant for \'coloureds\' and eat the chicken in the car park. \'That story still haunts me,\' she wrote. \'It reminds me of how young our country is. How far we\'ve come and how far we still have to come.\' An old clip of Meghan filmed as part of the \'I Won\'t Stand For...\' campaign for non-profit organisation Erase the Hate, has come to light following the recent protests. In the video, Meghan shared her hope that society will become more \'open-minded\' Meghan, whose father Thomas Markle is Caucasian and mother Doria Ragland is African-American, wrote of her background: \'While my mixed heritage may have created a grey area surrounding my self-identification, keeping me with a foot on both sides of the fence, I have come to embrace that. \'To who I am, to share where I\'m from, to voice my pride in being a strong, confident mixed-race woman.\' In a piece for Elle Magazine in 2015, she she witnessed her mother being called \'the n word\' by another driver in Los Angeles and described the heartache it caused. \'My skin rushed with heat as I looked to my mom. Her eyes welling with hateful tears, I could only breathe out a whisper of words, so hushed they were barely audible: \'It\'s OK, Mommy\',\' she wrote. Meghan also described how her great-great-great-grandfather went on to create his own identity when freed from slavery. The Duchess has opened up in the past about how racism has affected her own family. She is pictured as a young girl with her father Thomas Markle \'Because in 1865 (which is so shatteringly recent), when slavery was abolished in the United States, former slaves had to choose a name. A surname, to be exact,\' she wrote. \'Perhaps the closest thing to connecting me to my ever-complex family tree, my longing to know where I come from and the commonality that links me to my bloodline, is the choice that my great-great-great grandfather made to start anew. \'He chose the last name Wisdom.\' As a child, her father, from whom she is now estranged, created a Barbie family for Christmas when they were only sold in sets of white dolls or black dolls. She wrote on her lifestyle blog how her new collection had \'a black mom doll, a white dad doll, and a child in each colour. My dad had taken the sets apart and customised my family.\' \'I\'m so sorry that you have to grow up in a world where this is still present\': Meghan\'s full speech to students \'Immaculate Heart High School, the graduating class of 2020. For the past couple of weeks I\'ve been planning on saying a few words to you for your graduation. \'And as we\'ve all seen over the last week what is happening in our country and in our state and in our home town of LA has been absolutely devastating. \'And I wasn\'t sure what I could to you. I wanted to the right thing and I was really nervous that I wouldn\'t or that it would get picked apart. \'And I realised the only wrong thing to is to nothing. Because George Floyd\'s life mattered and Breonna Taylor\'s life mattered and Philando Castile\'s life mattered and Tamir Rice\'s life mattered, and so did so many other people whose names we know and whose names we do not know. Stephon Clark, his life mattered. \'And I was thinking about this moment when I was a sophomore in high school, I was 15, and as you know sophomore year is the year we do volunteer work, which is a prerequisite for graduating. \'And I remember my teacher at the time, one of my teachers, Ms Pollia, to me as I was leaving for a day of volunteering, \'always remember to put other\'s needs above your own fears\'. \'And that has stuck with me throughout my entire life and I have thought about it more in the last week than ever before. \'So the first thing I want to to you is that I\'m sorry. I\'m so sorry that you have to grow up in a world where this is still present.\' \'I was 11 or 12 years old when I was just about to start Immaculate Heart Middle School in the fall, and it was the LA Riots, which was also triggered by senseless act of racism. \'And I remember the curfew and I remember rushing back home and on that drive home, seeing ash fall from the sky and smelling the smoke and seeing the smoke billow out of buildings and seeing people run out of buildings carrying bags and looting. \'And I remember seeing men in the back of a van just holding guns and rifles. And I remember pulling up at the house and seeing the tree, that had always been there, completely charred. And those memories don\'t go away. \'And I can\'t imagine that at 17 or 18 years old, which is how old you are now, that you would have to have a different version of that same type of experience. That\'s something that you should have an understanding of, but an understanding of as a history lesson, not as your reality. \'So I am sorry in a way that we have not gotten the world to a place where you deserve it to be. \'The other thing though that I do remember about that time was how people came together, and we are seeing that right now. We are seeing that from the sheriff in Michigan or the police chief in Virginia. \'We are seeing people stand in solidarity, we are seeing communities come together and to uplift. And you are going to be part of this movement. \'I know that this is not the graduation that you envisioned and this is not the celebration that you imagined. \'But I also know that there\'s a way for us to reframe this for you to not see this as the end of something but instead to see this as the beginning of you harnessing all the work, all of the values, all of the skills that you have embodied over the last four years – and now you channel that. \'Now all of that work gets activated. Now you get to be part of rebuilding. And I know that sometimes people how many times do we need to rebuild? \'But you know that you\'re going to rebuild, rebuild and rebuilt until it is rebuilt. Because when the foundation is broken, so are we. You are going to lead with love, you are going to lead with compassion, you are going to use your voice. You\'re going to use your voice in a stronger way than you have ever been able to because most of you are 18 – or you\'re going to turn 18 — so you\'re going to vote. \'You are going to have empathy for those who don\'t see the world through the same lens that you do, because with as diverse, vibrant and opened minded as I know the teachings at Immaculate Heart are, I know you know that black lives matter. So I am already excited for what you\'re going to do in the world. \'You are equipped, you are ready, we need you and you are prepared. I am so proud to call each of you a fellow alumni, and I\'m so eager to see what you\'re going to do. \'Please know that I am cheering you on all along the way, I am exceptionally proud of you, and I\'m wishing you a huge congratulations on today, the start of all the impact you\'re going to make in the world as leaders that we all so deeply crave. Congratulations ladies, and thank you in advance.\' Advertisement \'If you think I\'m a racist, go f*** yourself\': Anthony Joshua hits out at critics of his Black Lives Matters speech where he told people to stop spending money in \'their\' shops and \'invest in black-owned businesses\' instead Anthony Joshua has hit out at critics who accused him of racism after he told a Black Lives Matter crowd to stop spending money in \'their\' shops and \'invest in black-owned businesses\'. The heavyweight champion, 30, had joined hundreds of protesters at a rally in Watford on Saturday, where he read out a letter about the fight against racism. Speaking to the crowd, Joshua delivered an impassioned speech written by his friend Reece Campbell who he was unable to attend the gathering. In a short clip of the address which was posted to social media without context, he : \'Show them where it hurts. \'Abstain from spending your money in their shops and economies, and invest in black-owned businesses.\' After facing criticism and accusations of racism over the snippet, Joshua took to Twitter on Sunday to explain \'the speech was passed around for someone to read and I took the lead.\' He : \'If you think I\'m a racist, go f*** yourself! If you watch the full video, the speech was passed around for someone to read and I took the lead. Anthony Joshua hits back at critics who claimed he is \'racist\' following his speech in the park Joshua responded to critics with an image of some text on Twitter on Sunday evening ""The virus has been declared a pandemic. It is out of control. And I\'m not actually talking about COVID-19. The virus I\'m referring to is called racism.” Boxing champ Anthony Joshua gave a speech at a protest in England, then led a ""Black Lives Matter"" chant. (@anthonyfjoshua) https://t.co/r8AeGsZcA3 — Bleacher Report (@BleacherReport) June 7, 2020 \'I personally spoke from the heart about the Watford community, ideas of us personally investing seven figures to create unity and opportunities and adding change to the African/Caribbean community. \'Shops aren\'t the issue here. Before you talk s***, you better boycott racism.\' He posted the statement alongside a short video, which shows him holding up a piece of paper and saying: \'That was a few words from my friend Reece who couldn’t make it here today. \'Thank you all for listening. I hope you can all take something away from today whether it\'s individually or community-wise. \'So these are my own words. I didn’t really plan anything, I\'m not into the public-speaking stuff unless it’s a question and answer type of thing.\' In another clip from the rally, Joshua is seen standing on crutches as he called on the crowd to \'stand united against the virus which has been instrumental in taking lives.\' Reading Mr Campbell\'s letter, he : \'Today we join many thousands of protesters in the UK and many hundreds of thousands across the globe. \'We stand united against the virus which has been instrumental in taking lives. A virus which is not apologetic, a virus that spreads across all sectors of our communities - sports, education, churches, entertainment, the media and the Government. \'Not just in the UK, but across the world. The virus has been declared a pandemic, this is out of control and I\'m not talking about Covid-19. The virus I\'m referring to is called racism.\' The heavyweight champion read aloud a speech from a piece of paper during the protests A snippet of the initial speech Joshua read was taken out of context on social media He went on to call for Britons to \'speak out in peaceful demonstrations\', but to not \'use these demonstrations for selfish motives and turn it into rioting and looting.\' \'How long are we going to allow racism to spread through our community and affect our lives without using the vaccine you already have in your possession? Me and you, you are the vaccine, I am the vaccine. \'We can no longer, from today onwards, we can no longer sit back and remain silent on the senseless, unlawful killings, sly racism of another human being based only on what? Their skin colour.\' Joshua later spoke to a local councillor who had attended the demonstration, and proposed plans to create a new community centre in Watford. The boxer, who lives in the town with his son JJ, four, he hopes to purchase a building and create a space for young people in the community to go after school. The anti-racism protest was one of dozens taking place across the globe this weekend following the death of George Floyd, who was killed by a white police officer in Minneapolis, United States on May 25. Protests have occurred around the world following the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis Joshua joined hundreds of peaceful protestors on the march through his hometown Joshua wore a hoodie with Black Lives Matter on the front in support of the movement Police officer Derek Chauvin has since been charged with second degree murder after a video emerged showing him kneeling on Floyd\'s neck for almost nine minutes while he laid on the floor in handcuffs. His death has sparked a series of protests across the US and solidarity demonstrations around the world. Speaking at the rally on Saturday, Joshua went on to explain that the death of Floyd was the catalyst for the protests. \'But I know I\'ve taken my street knowledge and put it into the corporate world and I\'ve gained a lot of respect in that sense. So anyway, gang culture is done,\' he . \'So, where was I. We have to engage with the youth and put an end to black youth gang culture. This postcode war - how many houses do we own on that postcode that we\'re fighting for? Joshua wore a leg brace and walked with crutches after sustaining a training injury Hundreds turned out for the Black Lives Matter protest march in Watford on Saturday \'Let\'s inject the vaccine. Every life matters - 100 per cent I agree with that. But that does include black lives and that\'s why we\'re here today. \'George Floyd - we\'re all aware of his name - was the catalyst in a list that is already way, way, way too long.\' Joshua\'s appearance on crutches also saw fans fear that the heavyweight boxer sustained a serious injury. However, spokesperson for the 30-year-old confirmed to Sportsmail that his injury is not serious, saying: \'Anthony felt a slight twinge in his knee whilst training. \'The brace Is a precautionary measure on the advise of physios. It will be further checked by his doctors but there is no immediate concern.\'', ""Priti Patel today acts of 'hooliganism' seen during anti-racism protests in the UK over the weekend were 'utterly indefensible' as she warned the perpetrators they will face justice. The Home Secretary told MPs this afternoon that there is 'no excuse for pelting flares at brave officers' or for 'vandalising the statue of Winston Churchill'. She almost 140,000 people were now thought to have attended protests in recent days and that 'while the majority were peaceful, a lawless minority of protesters have regrettably turned to violence' and they are now 'already being brought to justice'. Her comments came as Chancellor Rishi Sunak hit out at the 'small minority who committed acts of violence and vandalism' as he told them their methods 'are, and always will be, wrong'. Meanwhile, Boris Johnson's official spokesman had earlier the PM does not believe the UK is a racist country as he described the toppling of the monument to 17th century slave trader Edward Colston in Bristol yesterday as an 'act of criminal damage'. His spokesman : 'The PM doesn't doubt that there continues to be discrimination and racism, but does not agree that this is a racist country. We have made very significant progress on this issue, but there remains more to do and we will not be complacent in our efforts to stamp out racism and discrimination where it happens.' When asked about the Colston statue's destruction he : 'People can campaign for the removal of a statue, but what happened yesterday was a criminal act and when the criminal law is broken that is unacceptable and the police will want to hold to account those responsible'. Ms Patel told MPs that at least 35 officers had been injured during protests in London as she she 'salutes their bravery'. She : 'As the ugly tally of officer assaults shows some protesters regrettably turned to violence and abusive behaviour at the weekend. ‘This hooliganism is utterly indefensible. There is no justification for it. There is no excuse for pelting flares at brave officers, throwing bikes at police horses, attempting to disrespect the Cenotaph or vandalising the statue of Winston Churchill, one of the greatest protectors of our freedoms who has ever lived. ‘It is not for mobs to tear down statues and cause criminal damage in our streets and it is not acceptable for thugs to racially abuse black police officers for doing their jobs. ‘The criminals responsible for these unlawful and reckless acts are betraying the very cause that they purport to serve.’ Ms Patel in normal circumstances peaceful mass protests would be acceptable but that because of the coronavirus crisis 'these are not normal circumstances' as she reminded the nation that 'any large gatherings of people are currently unlawful'. Mr Sunak tweeted: 'To the small minority who committed acts of violence and vandalism last weekend, not only were your actions criminal, but they also perpetuate a dangerous lie: that the temporary excitement of destruction is the same thing as change. You are, and always will be, wrong. ‘But to the vast majority who seek only peaceful protest within the law and a better future for themselves and their children: whilst our progress feels show, I promise you it is permanent.’ Downing Street today the police 'have our full support in tackling any violence, vandalism and disorderly behaviour'. Rank-and-file officers left bloodied by attacks with sticks and rocks have today accused their bosses of allowing 'lawlessness' to take hold because of public perception instead of allowing them to deal with the attackers 'more robustly'. Home Secretary Priti Patel told MPs this afternoon that 'there is no excuse for pelting flares at brave officers, throwing bikes at police horses, attempting to disrespect the Cenotaph or vandalising the statue of Winston Churchill' Police push back three young men who try to join the protest in Whitehall yesterday as Boris Johnson today that Britain is not a racist country Protesters throw statue of Edward Colston into Bristol harbour during a Black Lives Matter protest rally yesterday As the protests descended into chaos, one protester (left and right) was seen climbing on the historic monument The Cenotaph and setting fire to the Union Jack flag Arrests on Whitehall yesterday evening, including this man dragged away by his arms and legs, are to have sparked violence A protester is placed in a spit hood as he is restrained by Police Officers close to Westminster tube station yesterday Another suspect is pinned down on the fifth night of violence in Central London. Police unions the tactics have been wrong A protester is pulled away as peaceful demonstrations in the capital turn violent in the wake of the death of George Floyd in the U.S. I tagged the statue of Churchill because he's a confirmed racist': Defiant Black Lives Matter protester he desecrated the wartime PM's plinth The Black Lives Matter protester who 'tagged' the statue of Winston Churchill he did it because Britain's greatest Prime Minister was a 'confirmed racist' who cared more about colonialism than black people. The masked young man, who is being searched for by the Metropolitan Police today for the vandalism in Parliament Square, claimed that Mr Churchill only fought the Nazis to protect the empire - not for 'people of colour'. Using black spray paint yesterday he daubed the phrase 'was racist' below the wartime leader's name, leaving the monument reading: 'Churchill was a racist'. A 'f*** your agenda was also added. After leaving Parliament Square last night he spoke to a BBC reporter and : 'I tagged up the statue of Churchill because he's a confirmed racist. He fought the Nazis to protect the Commonwealth from invasion - he didn't do it for black people or for people of colour. 'It was purely for colonialism. People will be angry - but I'm angry that for many years we have been oppressed'. He added; You can't enslave people, have the largest colonial empire in history and be like 'Yeah let's be peaceful - let's talk'. It don't work like that. We're p***ed off. F**k that'. He also that people from BAME backgrounds who fought in the Second World War are not properly recognised for their sacrifices. Advertisement In Bristol there have been no arrests in relation to the destruction of Colston's statue despite 17 suspects being identified and Avon and Somerset Police have they have 'no regrets' about not stopping it being pulled down and thrown in the city's harbour. Labour's shadow justice secretary David Lammy has compared those who toppled the monument to followers of Martin Luther King and the suffragettes - but 'should have come down a long time ago in a democratic way'. He told ITV's Good Morning Britain: 'I'm quite sure that those young people who brought that statue down knew that they would be facing the law but that was a price they were willing to pay and there are many examples throughout history, from Martin Luther King to Harvey Milk, who protested on behalf of gay rights. Many, many men and women following these people and being prepared to break the law because they believed the issue of justice they wanted to shine a light on was a bigger project'. Since last Wednesday 49 officers in London have been injured but there have only been around 60 arrests - 36 people alone yesterday - and Ken Marsh, chief of the Met Police Federation, has asked Commissioner Dame Cressida Dick to apologise to her officers and : 'Let me be clear, we as a police service can deal with these outbreaks of disorder, no problems. But it seems we are more concerned about image and perception rather than protecting our brave police officers and maintaining order. 'It's sadly now clear – and frankly has been clear for a number of days - that some people are using these protests as an excuse to attack police officers. We have had enough warnings. The tactics being used by the Metropolitan Police are very wrong. And need to be looked at as a matter of urgency.' In Bristol yesterday a group armed with ropes and tools dragged down the statue of slave trader Edward Colston in a 'premeditated' act of criminal damage and were then allowed to roll it to the city's dock and hurl it into the water. Superintendent Andy Bennett, who was in charge in the city yesterday, he had 'no regrets' about not intervening as activists dragged the statue down - but conceded that officers were 'duty-bound' to investigate. He : 'As a police officer, I don't get to choose which laws I uphold and which I don't. We are duty-bound to investigate this. We know and have identified 17 main offenders in terms of tearing it down and an investigation is underway.' Avon and Somerset Police chief constable Andy Marsh has this aftenoon backed the decision and that had his officers intervened to arrest those responsible there would have been a 'very violent confrontation'. 'To arrest suspects would likely to lead to injuries to suspects, injuries to officers, and people who were not involved in damaging property being thrown into a very violent confrontation with the police that could have had serious ramifications for the city of Bristol and beyond,' Mr Marsh . 'Can you imagine scenes of police in Bristol fighting with protesters who were damaging the statue of a man who is reputed to have gathered much of his fortune through the slave trade? 'I think there would have been very serious implications and whilst I certainly do not condone crime or damage of any sort, I fully support the actions of my officers. 'They responded with common sense, sound judgment and in the best interest of public safety.' The chairman of the Police Federation, which represents all officers in England and Wales, has criticised Avon and Somerset Police for its decision not to intervene in a protest in Bristol where a statue of a slave trader was torn down. John Apter told BBC Breakfast: 'To have no police presence there I think sent quite a negative message. I am a police officer so I don't support this lawlessness we saw where this statue was ripped down and rolled down the street and pushed into the river because that is not how we do things'. In London 22 officers were injured over the weekend on top of 13 last week after being pelted with objects on Whitehall. One activist clambered onto The Cenotaph, the war monument dedicated to the millions of lives lost during the First World War, and set fire to the Union Jack flag, while another gang defaced the monument to Winston Churchill in Westminster and daubed 'was a racist' on its plinth. Police officers were shown being chased down streets and across bridges by protesters throwing bottles and rocks. One Met Police riot unit tackling the violence tweeted a picture of a boulder thrown at them last night and : 'No it's not an asteroid. It's one of the many things we had thrown at us last night between Parliament Square and Elephant and Castle. Multiple officers injured from our line alone. Unacceptable'. As police unions told MailOnline London Mayor Sadiq Khan must close down the city and ban any further Black Lives Matter protests, it also emerged: Policing minister Kit Malthouse there would need to be a 'post-mortem' into how the anti-racism protests across the weekend were enforced - but it was not practical to arrest all those who took part for breaking coronavirus-related restrictions; Met Police Chief Cressida Dick she is 'depressed' by the violence and : 'The violent criminality we saw is disgraceful and will have been frightening' Bristol's Mayor Marvin Rees he is in 'no rush' to fish out the Edward Colston statue and when it is pulled from the dock it will probably go to a museum rather than be put back; Sir Keir Starmer has the toppling of a slave trader statue during Black Lives Matter protests in Bristol was 'completely wrong' - but adds the statue should have been removed some time ago; When asked whether police should have looked to have stopped the Colston statute from being toppled in Bristol, Kit Malthouse told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: 'I know if they (police) possibly can prevent crime taking place by intervening in a public order situation they will, but obviously it is a difficult situation for frontline commanders and no doubt there will be a post-mortem, if you like, of the public order situation in Bristol, and indeed elsewhere in the country, to make sure lessons can be learned.' People celebrate in the Winston Churchill statue in Parliament Square yesterday - the day it was defaced. It is not not known if these two men were involved Protesters tied ropes around the statue of Edward Colston in Bristol city centre, before tearing it to the ground on Sunday Another suspect is led away by police on Vauxhall Bridge - one of around 60 arrests in London since protests began last Wednse Dozens of police officers have now been injured in the attacks on them in the past five days. Many have questioned why they are not all in riot gear BBC blasted for headline saying Black Lives Matter protests in London were 'largely peaceful' The BBC were last night blasted for labelling Black Lives Matter protests in London as 'largely peaceful' after 27 police officers were injured - including one officer who was pictured bleeding from the head. Violent scenes showed police officers injured on the streets and others being pelted by objects as they ran for safety as a peaceful anti-racism demonstration turned violent yesterday. Metropolitan Police chiefs 27 police officers were injured, 14 alone on Saturday, and 13 across last week, while a further eight were confirmed to have been injured last night - bringing the total to 35 in London since protests began. One scene showing police being chased by protesters as they fled a barrage of objects thrown at them has been described as 'despicable' by the Met Police Federation - which represents rank-and-file officers. But criticism was turned on the BBC last night after the publicly-funded news organisation headlined one of its online pieces about the protests: '27 police officers injured during largely peaceful protests anti-racism protests in London'. It was later changed to: 'George Floyd: London anti-racism protests leave 27 officers hurt'. Among the critics of the original headline were former UKIP leader and now Brexit Party founder Nigel Farage, who on Twitter: 'Typical of the BBC, this is why the public are turning away from them.' Former MEP Patrick O'Flynn : 'How can an event that has left 27 police officers injured merit the description 'largely peaceful'.' Advertisement But Mr Malthouse indicated that it would not have been practical to arrest all those who took part for breaking coronavirus-related restrictions. He added: 'We did right at the start that this was against the regulations. 'But obviously the reality was that people were going to come anyway. Other than arresting whatever it was - 15,000 people in London and many more elsewhere - managing the protest was I think the best call given the strength of feeling that was running.' Ken Marsh, chairman of the Metropolitan Police Federation, called for tube stations in central London to be shut and Hyde Park and Whitehall - the areas targeted by protesters last week - to be closed off to the public. The draconian measures, he , will also help stop tens of thousands of people swarming into the city ignoring social distancing regulations during the Covid-19 pandemic. Mr Marsh's comments come after violent clashes over the weekend saw a female mounted officer suffer a broken collarbone, cracked ribs and a collapsed lung after she came off her horse when the animal was spooked by flares and other missiles hurled by protesters. Officers were left bruised and bloodied after being pelted with bottles and road signs and hit with sticks and metal poles by yobs who also vandalised the Cenotaph and statue to Sir Winston Churchill outside Parliament. A total of 41 arrests were made over the weekend. With fears over further trouble this weekend - as right-wing activist Tommy Robinson pledged to travel to London on Saturday to join football fans in protecting the capital's monuments - Mr Marsh told MailOnline: 'These protests have to stop now. 'We need to be more robust in terms of policing and we need to stop this happening. We know about it, we've got the intelligence. The Mayor Sadiq Khan now needs to come out and 'I'm not having this in my city'. 'We are in the middle of a pandemic here. And we allow this to take place, even though these protests are increasingly being hijacked by those intent on confrontation with the police. 'We shouldn't have allowed it, we should have shut the tubes, shut Hyde Park and shut Whitehall.

But in the middle of this pandemic? No. Bristol mayor Colston statue WILL be fished out of docks - but it should be put in a museum Bristol Mayor Marvin Rees the statue was still underwater but confirmed it would be removed at some point and should be put in a museum. Around 10,000 people took part in the protest on Sunday, which was praised by the force for being 'peaceful and respectful'. Marvin Rees, the elected Labour Mayor of Bristol, praised the police's handling of the event as 'intelligent and nuanced'. Mr Rees he could not condone the damage and was also concerned about the implications of a mass gathering in terms of the coronavirus pandemic. 'I'm the mixed race child of a Welsh-English white woman and a black Jamaican father,' he told BBC Breakfast. 'One of my ancestors would have been taken on a ship from Africa to the Caribbean. 'That statue is an affront to me and there's a plaque on it as well that describes him as a 'wise and virtuous son', so that's a double insult. 'It's not something that I as a Bristolian would have looked on with pride and it had been a point of debate in the city.' Mr Rees Bristol only started to really discuss its relationship with slavery in a 'meaningful way' about 20 years ago and that conversation would now 'go up a few gears'. 'We have a statue up to someone who made his money buying and selling people,' he told BBC Breakfast. 'That statue is now underwater, which is a piece of poetic and historical irony because, undoubtedly, people would have been thrown off the sides of the ships during the journey themselves and there will be many African bodies on the bottom of the water.' Mr Rees the statue would be pulled out of the harbour 'at some point' and placed in a museum. Placards from the Black Lives Matter march, which were laid around the plinth where the statue had stood, have also been collected and will be put on display. Advertisement 'Let's get this dealt with, let's make sure we're all safe in relation to Covid 19 because all lives matter, and then if you want to protest do what you want to do. 'But at the moment this is just selfish. It's not necessary. My colleagues have no choice whatsoever, they have to be there and I thought they did an incredible job over the weekend. 'The provocation was quite high to which they didn't react to. They took the abuse that was thrown at them. I don't know why they're taking this sort of abuse on the back of something that took place 5000 miles away but this is where we are. I thought they did a sterling job without fear or favour. 'The problem is now that I think people have cottoned onto the fact they can now get away with coming out onto the streets, whereas they couldn't when they were locked up at home for ten weeks. 'But the legislation is that not more than six people can gather. Is it two sets of rules? This is just ridiculous and it's putting all my colleagues at risk and I don't want my colleagues to be put at risk.' The worst of the trouble erupted outside Downing Street on Saturday evening after a largely peaceful protest over the death of African-American George Floyd, who died in U.S police custody two weeks ago. Missiles, including several flares, were hurled over security gates guarding the entrance to the Prime Minister's official residence by a crowd who had earlier chanted 'Boris Johnson's a racist'. The violence prompted officers in riot gear to intervene followed by the mounted division. In the chaos that ensued, a mounted came off her horse after colliding into traffic lights as protesters threw fireworks, bangers, bottles and at one point even a Boris Bike. Dramatic footage showed a riderless horse bolting back down Whitehall, colliding with an innocent demonstrator as it do so. The injured officer was pictured lying motionless and unconscious on the floor before she was dragged away by her colleagues. She is now stable in hospital. Mr Marsh praised the officer and : 'She's a hero because, like my other colleagues, she put herself on the line for a protest that was unlawful, shouldn't have taken place and, by its very nature, could have caused thousands more deaths by being held in the middle of a pandemic. 'The officer is currently stable in hospital but serious injuries have been sustained, a broken collarbone, broken ribs and a collapsed lung. Not life-threatening but it will take quite a while to recover, three to four months I'd imagine. 'They are not nice injuries. Anyone who's had a broken collarbone will know that it's a horrible injury because it's one of those that's very difficult to heal. Likewise broken ribs and a collapsed lung are also horrible because there isn't anything you can prescribe for them. 'She will be alright but it's going to take a bit of time.' Warehouse worker tells how he joined four Army cadet volunteers to scrub off 'Churchill was a racist' graffiti A group of youong men of remove graffiti from a statue of Winston Churchill at Parliament Square in London this morning A group of volunteers including four Army cadets cleaned up a memorial to Winston Churchill in London this morning after it was defaced by activists during yesterday's violent Black Lives Matter protests. The men scrubbed graffiti off the statue one day after the phrase 'was racist' was added in spray paint by protesters below the wartime leader's name, leaving the monument reading: 'Churchill was a racist'. A fifth man, warehouse worker called Max Marshall, 25, who had just finished a night shift and went to Saturday's protests, also cleaned up, telling MailOnline he went there because it 'just felt like it was the right thing to do.' The volunteers, who brought their own cleaning products, only stopped and left when a professional cleaner - remarkably called Winston - also turned up this morning and he had been asked to do the job professionally. It came as the clean-up also began in Bristol as council crews removed BLM placards and used chemicals and spray to clean graffit off the plinth from which the statue of slave trader Edward Colston was torn down yesterday. Speaking to MailOnline today, Max : 'For me it was a decision I made last night. I worked during a long night shift and I received the news that the statue was being defaced. I just felt like it was the right thing to do. 'It was completely independent, I thought to myself I'd be the only one there. I didn't mean to antagonise or upset anyone to do it. When I got there I was pleased to see four young Army cadets already cleaning the statue. 'I did actually attend the Black Lives Matter protest on Saturday in support of the movement. I feel strongly to show solidarity. I understand the actions that carried on late into last night were that of a minority. 'But I will not have war memorials defaced. The violence and to see the anger and hatred towards the police was very, very hard to watch for me. It came to standing up for what's right.' Max added: 'We brought our own cleaning products and they weren't really up to the job. We only left because remarkably a gentleman called Winston asked us to stop because he'd been asked to do the job professionally.' Advertisement Just 24-hours after the mayhem in Westminster another Black Lives Matter protest took place in London yesterday. Thousands gathered outside the American Embassy, just south of the River Thames in Nine Elms, before heading back into Westminster, where further clashes with police took place. One officer was seen with blood pouring down his head after being hit by a traffic cone while mobile phone footage showed other officers being forced to run from a baying bottle-throwing mob. A dispersal order was enforced in Westminster until 6am this morning as riot police battled into the night to move a group of about 50 violent protesters on. Earlier in the day, Black Lives Matter protesters in Bristol had toppled a bronze statue of 17th century slave trader Edward Colston and rolled it into the harbour. The Prime Minister condemned the trouble in both cities. In a statement he the BLM protests were 'subverted by thuggery' and that the violence was a 'betrayal' of their cause. And last night English Defence League founder Tommy Robinson blasted the 'Soft-handed' police approach for failing to protect the Cenotaph and the Sir Winston Churchill statue. He told his followers on social media that he would be heading into London on Saturday, adding: 'I cannot believe what's come of our capital city. 'Attack that statue like you did in Bristol today and think there's not going to be a British public there to confront you about it, you're wrong. 'You watch next Saturday how many people turn up.' A group called the Democratic Football Lads Alliance, made up of football fans from around Britain, has pledged to form a protective ring around London's war memorials and statues to prevent them from being damaged in protests. The clean-up began in Bristol today as council teams removed BLM placards and used chemicals to clean off graffiti defacing the plinth that held the Edward Colston statue in Bristol, and another of Winston Churchill in London. On the Colston statue, Bristol Mayor Marvin Rees it will be fished out 'at some point' and it is 'highly likely' to end up in one of the city's museums - with a debate set to be held over what should replace it on the plinth. Speaking about the general public disorder, Home Secretary Priti Patel told Sky News: 'I think that is utterly disgraceful and that speaks to the acts of public disorder that actually have now become a distraction from the cause in which people are actually protesting about and trying to empathise and sympathise with. 'That is completely an unacceptable act and that speaks to the vandalism - again as we saw (on Saturday) in London - but sheer vandalism and disorder completely is unacceptable. And it's right the police follow up on that and make sure that justice is taken with those individuals responsible for such disorderly and lawless behaviour.' The shocking images come as global demonstrations intensify after George Floyd, a 46-year-old black man, died after police officer Derek Chauvin put his knee on his neck in Minneapolis on May 25 for nine minutes. Demonstrators flouted social distancing rules yesterday to flood the streets around the US Embassy in London before marching on Westminster, protesting against racial injustice and police brutality. While the majority of the protests remained peaceful, violence erupted yet again, with images showing police and demonstrators suffering injuries during the melee which led to 12 arrests and eight officers being injured. The Metropolitan Police confirmed the majority of the arrests had been made for public order offences and one was for criminal damage following the incident at the Cenotaph. Also yesterday, images showed Black Lives Matter protesters tearing down a statue of 17th century slave trader and philanthropist Edward Colston in Bristol and dumping it in the harbour. Footage showed demonstrators, packed closely together - despite social distancing guidelines, heaving the metal monument down with ropes before cheering and dancing around it, with many placing their knees on the fallen statue as it lay on the ground - in a nod to the death of Mr Floyd. Marvin Rees, the Mayor of Bristol, told BBC Radio Bristol today: 'It's still underwater. At some point it will (be fished out) but we've a number of priorities in the city at the moment, not least trying to face up to an £80million gap in our budget that we've been left with by national Government not funding us adequately for Covid.' He added: 'I think that there's a really incredible opportunity to talk about ourselves and to make a decision about what we think should go on a plinth in the city to tell us about who we are, not just who we are but who we want to be and to really use that as a place to celebrate something about ourselves, the best of ourselves. 'What I would look forward to is having that city discussion. In the meantime it's highly likely that the Colston statue will end up in one of our museums.' But Government minister for crime and policing Kit Malthouse told BBC Breakfast: 'A crime was committed, criminal damage was committed, there should be evidence gathered and a prosecution should follow.' 'There is an elected mayor of Bristol, there is a council in Bristol and it is via those democratic means that we will resolve these issues in this country - not by people showing up with ropes and tools and committing criminal damage. We have to have a sense of order and democracy - that is how we sort things out and that is what should have happened.' But Labour's shadow justice secretary David Lammy told ITV's Good Morning Britain: 'I do absolutely support protest in the incident of the Colston statue. This is a man who transported over 80,000 African men women and children. It's shameful, shameful - we're actually discussing whether he should have a statue. People have been calling for that statue to come down in Bristol for many years. There may be a role for statues such as this in museums where there is proper context where they can think about their contribution to society as well as what they got wrong.'

But she added: 'There are no excuses for the unlawful behaviour and disorder we have witnessed throughout the weekend including the disgraceful vandalism we saw in Bristol and the utterly appalling abuse of our police officers.' Commenting on the desecration of Churchill's statue, she added: 'Winston Churchill is one of the greatest Britons who ever lived. We have him to thank for our very freedom to protest. The vandals who did this are repulsive criminals who I want to see brought to justice immediately.' Police officers had suffered 'serious injuries' inflicted by 'a small minority of violent people using the guise of peaceful protest to pursue reckless lawlessness,' she . She added: 'I know that the British public will be as appalled as I am at those scenes.' Outside Downing Street some demonstrators were seen turning violent as police officers tried to control the mass chaos and form a barricade with their riot shields. A group of members of the public remove graffiti from the statue of former British Prime Minister Winston Churchill today A person cleans graffiti from the statue of Winston Churchill at Parliament Square in London this morning Yesteday, Prime Minister Boris Johnson the anti-racism demonstrations had been 'subverted by thuggery' following a day of protests across the UK. He tweeted: 'People have a right to protest peacefully & while observing social distancing but they have no right to attack the police. 'These demonstrations have been subverted by thuggery - and they are a betrayal of the cause they purport to serve. Those responsible will be held to account.' Hours after the incident that saw the statue of Edward Colston pulled down in Bristol, the M6 in the Midlands was closed as Black Lives Matter protesters walked down the carriageway. A video posted on social media showed crowds of people covering the motorway at the Exhall interchange near Coventry as traffic remained stationary on the other side. Flares are launched into the air as police and demonstrators clash during Black Lives Matter protest in the nation's capital today Members of the police force attempt to disperse the crowds as a demonstrator climbs onto the national war monument in London One eyewitness claimed there were around 100 people who were heard chanting 'Black Lives Matter' as they took part in the demonstrations. Many drivers on the motorway were pictured emerging from their cars to watch the protests, which began at around 5pm, and the southbound carriageway was closed for around two hours. Today spokesperson for the protests in London, Superintendent Jo Edwards, : 'Regrettably officers were faced with further scenes of violence and disorder following a day of predominantly peaceful protest throughout the capital. 'This is a hugely impassioned movement and we understand the public's desire to have their voices heard – however it is not right that this passion has turned into violent attacks on officers. 'I would like to thank our officers, and those from the City of London Police and British Transport Police for their professionalism in the face of entirely unacceptable behaviour. 'Overnight our policing operation will continue and I would urge demonstrators thinking of returning to stay at home. The threat of Coronavirus remains very real, and we need you to protect yourselves, your friends and your family.' As the chaos continued, one protester, who took part in defacing the statue of the former Prime Minister Winston Churchill, was heard on camera saying: 'Tagged up Churchill as a racist on the statue of Churchill because he is a confirmed racist. 'He didn't fight the Nazis for the commonwealth or for anything else or for any personal freedoms. He fought the Nazis purely to protect the commonwealth against the invasion by foreign forces.

In a statement yesterday the police chief : 'I am deeply saddened and depressed that a minority of protesters became violent towards officers in central London yesterday evening. 'This led to 14 officers being injured, in addition to 13 hurt in earlier protests this week. 'We have made a number of arrests and justice will follow. I know many who were seeking to make their voices heard will be as appalled as I am by those scenes. 'I would urge protesters to please find another way to make your views heard which does not involve coming out on the streets of London, risking yourself, your families and officers as we continue to face [the deadly coronavirus].' Following the destruction of the statue in Bristol today former Chancellor of the Exchequer Sajid Javid condemned protesters' decision to force it down, declaring on Twitter: 'This is not OK'. Speaking after the demonstration, superintendent Andy Bennett vowed there would be an investigation into the 'act of criminal damage,' near Bristol Harbourside, where slave ships once docked centuries ago. Meanwhile Home Secretary Priti Patel told Sky News: 'I think that is utterly disgraceful. That speaks to the acts of public disorder that actually have become a distraction from the cause that people are actually protesting.

The scenes come as demonstrations continue to increase around the world after George Floyd, a 46-year-old African American man, died after police officer Derek Chauvin put his knee on his neck in Minneapolis on May 25 for nine minutes. Following the death of George Floyd, three other officers who were also present at the scene, Thomas Lane, J Alexander Kueng and Tou Thao – were charged with aiding and abetting second-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. Earlier today Health Secretary Matt Hancock it is 'undoubtedly a risk' that there will be an increase in Covid-19 cases following the protests, as he urged people not to gather in groups of more than six people. Mr Hancock he supported the activists' arguments, but : 'Please don't gather in groups of more than six people because there is also a pandemic that we must address and control.'

His spokesman : 'The PM doesn't doubt that there continues to be discrimination and racism, but does not agree that this is a racist country. We have made very significant progress on this issue, but there remains more to do and we will not be complacent in our efforts to stamp out racism and discrimination where it happens.' When asked about the Colston statue's destruction he : 'People can campaign for the removal of a statue, but what happened yesterday was a criminal act and when the criminal law is broken that is unacceptable and the police will want to hold to account those responsible'. Mr Johnson received an update from Met chief Dame Cressida Dick on Sunday night after more disturbances in Westminster, which saw 35 officers injured by rocks and bottles. There were 36 arrests yesterday. 'They have our full support in tackling any violence, vandalism and disorderly behaviour,' the Prime Minister's official spokesman , adding: 'It is completely unacceptable they were subjected to attacks over the weekend' It came as his Home Secretary Priti Patel vowed to bring violent Black Lives Matter protesters to 'justice' - but police officers battling the activists in the streets their bosses have got their tactics 'completely wrong'. The Home Secretary that the UK demonstrations following the murder of George Floyd by police in Minneapolis had been 'subverted by thuggery' and told those responsible: 'Justice will follow'. She told the Commons this afternoon: 'We strongly support the right to protest peacefully but that does not extend to the violent behaviour that we have witnessed across the country throughout the weekend. And when it comes to any assault on our brave police that is completely unacceptable. Any perpetrator should be in absolutely no doubt that they will be arrested and prosecuted.' She : ‘We are privileged to live in an open, democratic country with many values entrenched not just in our constitution but also in a rules-based system. There is no justification for violence at all. And when it comes to exercising people’s voices and obviously their particular issues and concerns there are many avenues through which those voices and concerns can be raised and made at a local council level. ‘Obviously that is the right way to approach these issues.’ Rank-and-file officers left bloodied by attacks with sticks and rocks have today accused their bosses of allowing 'lawlessness' to take hold because of public perception instead of allowing them to deal with the attackers 'more robustly'. Police push back three young men who try to join the protest in Whitehall yesterday as Boris Johnson today that Britain is not a racist country Protesters throw statue of Edward Colston into Bristol harbour during a Black Lives Matter protest rally yesterday As the protests descended into chaos, one protester (left and right) was seen climbing on the historic monument The Cenotaph and setting fire to the Union Jack flag Arrests on Whitehall yesterday evening, including this man dragged away by his arms and legs, are to have sparked violence A protester is placed in a spit hood as he is restrained by Police Officers close to Westminster tube station yesterday Another suspect is pinned down on the fifth night of violence in Central London. Police unions the tactics have been wrong A protester is pulled away as peaceful demonstrations in the capital turn violent in the wake of the death of George Floyd in the U.S. I tagged the statue of Churchill because he's a confirmed racist': Defiant Black Lives Matter protester he desecrated the wartime PM's plinth The Black Lives Matter protester who 'tagged' the statue of Winston Churchill he did it because Britain's greatest Prime Minister was a 'confirmed racist' who cared more about colonialism than black people. The masked young man, who is being searched for by the Metropolitan Police today for the vandalism in Parliament Square, claimed that Mr Churchill only fought the Nazis to protect the empire - not for 'people of colour'. Using black spray paint yesterday he daubed the phrase 'was racist' below the wartime leader's name, leaving the monument reading: 'Churchill was a racist'. A 'f*** your agenda was also added. After leaving Parliament Square last night he spoke to a BBC reporter and : 'I tagged up the statue of Churchill because he's a confirmed racist. He fought the Nazis to protect the Commonwealth from invasion - he didn't do it for black people or for people of colour. 'It was purely for colonialism. People will be angry - but I'm angry that for many years we have been oppressed'. He added; You can't enslave people, have the largest colonial empire in history and be like 'Yeah let's be peaceful - let's talk'. It don't work like that. We're p***ed off. F**k that'. He also that people from BAME backgrounds who fought in the Second World War are not properly recognised for their sacrifices. Advertisement In Bristol there have been no arrests at all in relation to the destruction of Colston's statue despite 17 suspects being identified and Avon and Somerset Police have they have 'no regrets' about not stopping it being pulled down and thrown in the city's harbour. Labour's shadow justice secretary David Lammy has compared those who toppled the monument to followers of Martin Luther King and the suffragettes - but 'should have come down a long time ago in a democratic way'. He told ITV's Good Morning Britain: 'I'm quite sure that those young people who brought that statue down knew that they would be facing the law but that was a price they were willing to pay and there are many examples throughout history, from Martin Luther King to Harvey Milk, who protested on behalf of gay rights. Many, many men and women following these people and being prepared to break the law because they believed the issue of justice they wanted to shine a light on was a bigger project'. Since last Wednesday 49 officers in London have been injured but there have only been around 60 arrests - 36 people alone yesterday - and Ken Marsh, chief of the Met Police Federation, has asked Commissioner Dame Cressida Dick to apologise to her officers and : 'Let me be clear, we as a police service can deal with these outbreaks of disorder, no problems. But it seems we are more concerned about image and perception rather than protecting our brave police officers and maintaining order. 'It's sadly now clear – and frankly has been clear for a number of days - that some people are using these protests as an excuse to attack police officers. We have had enough warnings. The tactics being used by the Metropolitan Police are very wrong. And need to be looked at as a matter of urgency.' In Bristol yesterday a group armed with ropes and tools dragged down the statue of slave trader Edward Colston in a 'premeditated' act of criminal damage and were then allowed to roll it to the city's dock and hurl it into the water. Superintendent Andy Bennett, who was in charge in the city yesterday, he had 'no regrets' about not intervening as activists dragged the statue down - but conceded that officers were 'duty-bound' to investigate. He : 'As a police officer, I don't get to choose which laws I uphold and which I don't. We are duty-bound to investigate this. We know and have identified 17 main offenders in terms of tearing it down and an investigation is underway.' Avon and Somerset Police chief constable Andy Marsh has this aftenoon backed the decision and that had his officers intervened to arrest those responsible there would have been a 'very violent confrontation'. 'To arrest suspects would likely to lead to injuries to suspects, injuries to officers, and people who were not involved in damaging property being thrown into a very violent confrontation with the police that could have had serious ramifications for the city of Bristol and beyond,' Mr Marsh . 'Can you imagine scenes of police in Bristol fighting with protesters who were damaging the statue of a man who is reputed to have gathered much of his fortune through the slave trade? 'I think there would have been very serious implications and whilst I certainly do not condone crime or damage of any sort, I fully support the actions of my officers. 'They responded with common sense, sound judgment and in the best interest of public safety.' The chairman of the Police Federation, which represents all officers in England and Wales, has criticised Avon and Somerset Police for its decision not to intervene in a protest in Bristol where a statue of a slave trader was torn down. John Apter told BBC Breakfast: 'To have no police presence there I think sent quite a negative message. I am a police officer so I don't support this lawlessness we saw where this statue was ripped down and rolled down the street and pushed into the river because that is not how we do things'. In London 22 officers were injured over the weekend on top of 13 last week after being pelted with objects on Whitehall. One activist clambered onto The Cenotaph, the war monument dedicated to the millions of lives lost during the First World War, and set fire to the Union Jack flag, while another gang defaced the monument to Winston Churchill in Westminster and daubed 'was a racist' on its plinth. Police officers were shown being chased down streets and across bridges by protesters throwing bottles and rocks. One Met Police riot unit tackling the violence tweeted a picture of a boulder thrown at them last night and : 'No it's not an asteroid. It's one of the many things we had thrown at us last night between Parliament Square and Elephant and Castle. Multiple officers injured from our line alone. Unacceptable'. As police unions told MailOnline London Mayor Sadiq Khan must close down the city and ban any further Black Lives Matter protests, it also emerged: Policing minister Kit Malthouse there would need to be a 'post-mortem' into how the anti-racism protests across the weekend were enforced - but it was not practical to arrest all those who took part for breaking coronavirus-related restrictions; Met Police Chief Cressida Dick she is 'depressed' by the violence and : 'The violent criminality we saw is disgraceful and will have been frightening' Bristol's Mayor Marvin Rees he is in 'no rush' to fish out the Edward Colston statue and when it is pulled from the dock it will probably go to a museum rather than be put back; Sir Keir Starmer has the toppling of a slave trader statue during Black Lives Matter protests in Bristol was 'completely wrong' - but adds the statue should have been removed some time ago; When asked whether police should have looked to have stopped the Colston statute from being toppled in Bristol, Kit Malthouse told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: 'I know if they (police) possibly can prevent crime taking place by intervening in a public order situation they will, but obviously it is a difficult situation for frontline commanders and no doubt there will be a post-mortem, if you like, of the public order situation in Bristol, and indeed elsewhere in the country, to make sure lessons can be learned.' People celebrate in the Winston Churchill statue in Parliament Square yesterday - the day it was defaced. It is not not known if these two men were involved Protesters tied ropes around the statue of Edward Colston in Bristol city centre, before tearing it to the ground on Sunday Another suspect is led away by police on Vauxhall Bridge - one of around 60 arrests in London since protests began last Wednse Dozens of police officers have now been injured in the attacks on them in the past five days. Many have questioned why they are not all in riot gear BBC blasted for headline saying Black Lives Matter protests in London were 'largely peaceful' The BBC were last night blasted for labelling Black Lives Matter protests in London as 'largely peaceful' after 27 police officers were injured - including one officer who was pictured bleeding from the head. Violent scenes showed police officers injured on the streets and others being pelted by objects as they ran for safety as a peaceful anti-racism demonstration turned violent yesterday. Metropolitan Police chiefs 27 police officers were injured, 14 alone on Saturday, and 13 across last week, while a further eight were confirmed to have been injured last night - bringing the total to 35 in London since protests began. One scene showing police being chased by protesters as they fled a barrage of objects thrown at them has been described as 'despicable' by the Met Police Federation - which represents rank-and-file officers. But criticism was turned on the BBC last night after the publicly-funded news organisation headlined one of its online pieces about the protests: '27 police officers injured during largely peaceful protests anti-racism protests in London'. It was later changed to: 'George Floyd: London anti-racism protests leave 27 officers hurt'. Among the critics of the original headline were former UKIP leader and now Brexit Party founder Nigel Farage, who on Twitter: 'Typical of the BBC, this is why the public are turning away from them.' Former MEP Patrick O'Flynn : 'How can an event that has left 27 police officers injured merit the description 'largely peaceful'.' Advertisement But Mr Malthouse indicated that it would not have been practical to arrest all those who took part for breaking coronavirus-related restrictions. He added: 'We did right at the start that this was against the regulations. 'But obviously the reality was that people were going to come anyway. Other than arresting whatever it was - 15,000 people in London and many more elsewhere - managing the protest was I think the best call given the strength of feeling that was running.' Ken Marsh, chairman of the Metropolitan Police Federation, called for tube stations in central London to be shut and Hyde Park and Whitehall - the areas targeted by protesters last week - to be closed off to the public. The draconian measures, he , will also help stop tens of thousands of people swarming into the city ignoring social distancing regulations during the Covid-19 pandemic. Mr Marsh's comments come after violent clashes over the weekend saw a female mounted officer suffer a broken collarbone, cracked ribs and a collapsed lung after she came off her horse when the animal was spooked by flares and other missiles hurled by protesters. Officers were left bruised and bloodied after being pelted with bottles and road signs and hit with sticks and metal poles by yobs who also vandalised the Cenotaph and statue to Sir Winston Churchill outside Parliament. A total of 41 arrests were made over the weekend. With fears over further trouble this weekend - as right-wing activist Tommy Robinson pledged to travel to London on Saturday to join football fans in protecting the capital's monuments - Mr Marsh told MailOnline: 'These protests have to stop now. 'We need to be more robust in terms of policing and we need to stop this happening. We know about it, we've got the intelligence. The Mayor Sadiq Khan now needs to come out and 'I'm not having this in my city'. 'We are in the middle of a pandemic here. And we allow this to take place, even though these protests are increasingly being hijacked by those intent on confrontation with the police. 'We shouldn't have allowed it, we should have shut the tubes, shut Hyde Park and shut Whitehall.

But in the middle of this pandemic? No. Bristol mayor Colston statue WILL be fished out of docks - but it should be put in a museum Bristol Mayor Marvin Rees the statue was still underwater but confirmed it would be removed at some point and should be put in a museum. Around 10,000 people took part in the protest on Sunday, which was praised by the force for being 'peaceful and respectful'. Marvin Rees, the elected Labour Mayor of Bristol, praised the police's handling of the event as 'intelligent and nuanced'. Mr Rees he could not condone the damage and was also concerned about the implications of a mass gathering in terms of the coronavirus pandemic. 'I'm the mixed race child of a Welsh-English white woman and a black Jamaican father,' he told BBC Breakfast. 'One of my ancestors would have been taken on a ship from Africa to the Caribbean. 'That statue is an affront to me and there's a plaque on it as well that describes him as a 'wise and virtuous son', so that's a double insult. 'It's not something that I as a Bristolian would have looked on with pride and it had been a point of debate in the city.' Mr Rees Bristol only started to really discuss its relationship with slavery in a 'meaningful way' about 20 years ago and that conversation would now 'go up a few gears'. 'We have a statue up to someone who made his money buying and selling people,' he told BBC Breakfast. 'That statue is now underwater, which is a piece of poetic and historical irony because, undoubtedly, people would have been thrown off the sides of the ships during the journey themselves and there will be many African bodies on the bottom of the water.' Mr Rees the statue would be pulled out of the harbour 'at some point' and placed in a museum. Placards from the Black Lives Matter march, which were laid around the plinth where the statue had stood, have also been collected and will be put on display. Advertisement 'Let's get this dealt with, let's make sure we're all safe in relation to Covid 19 because all lives matter, and then if you want to protest do what you want to do. 'But at the moment this is just selfish. It's not necessary. My colleagues have no choice whatsoever, they have to be there and I thought they did an incredible job over the weekend. 'The provocation was quite high to which they didn't react to. They took the abuse that was thrown at them. I don't know why they're taking this sort of abuse on the back of something that took place 5000 miles away but this is where we are. I thought they did a sterling job without fear or favour. 'The problem is now that I think people have cottoned onto the fact they can now get away with coming out onto the streets, whereas they couldn't when they were locked up at home for ten weeks. 'But the legislation is that not more than six people can gather. Is it two sets of rules? This is just ridiculous and it's putting all my colleagues at risk and I don't want my colleagues to be put at risk.' The worst of the trouble erupted outside Downing Street on Saturday evening after a largely peaceful protest over the death of African-American George Floyd, who died in U.S police custody two weeks ago. Missiles, including several flares, were hurled over security gates guarding the entrance to the Prime Minister's official residence by a crowd who had earlier chanted 'Boris Johnson's a racist'. The violence prompted officers in riot gear to intervene followed by the mounted division. In the chaos that ensued, a mounted came off her horse after colliding into traffic lights as protesters threw fireworks, bangers, bottles and at one point even a Boris Bike. Dramatic footage showed a riderless horse bolting back down Whitehall, colliding with an innocent demonstrator as it do so. The injured officer was pictured lying motionless and unconscious on the floor before she was dragged away by her colleagues. She is now stable in hospital. Mr Marsh praised the officer and : 'She's a hero because, like my other colleagues, she put herself on the line for a protest that was unlawful, shouldn't have taken place and, by its very nature, could have caused thousands more deaths by being held in the middle of a pandemic. 'The officer is currently stable in hospital but serious injuries have been sustained, a broken collarbone, broken ribs and a collapsed lung. Not life-threatening but it will take quite a while to recover, three to four months I'd imagine. 'They are not nice injuries. Anyone who's had a broken collarbone will know that it's a horrible injury because it's one of those that's very difficult to heal. Likewise broken ribs and a collapsed lung are also horrible because there isn't anything you can prescribe for them. 'She will be alright but it's going to take a bit of time.' Warehouse worker tells how he joined four Army cadet volunteers to scrub off 'Churchill was a racist' graffiti A group of youong men of remove graffiti from a statue of Winston Churchill at Parliament Square in London this morning A group of volunteers including four Army cadets cleaned up a memorial to Winston Churchill in London this morning after it was defaced by activists during yesterday's violent Black Lives Matter protests. The men scrubbed graffiti off the statue one day after the phrase 'was racist' was added in spray paint by protesters below the wartime leader's name, leaving the monument reading: 'Churchill was a racist'. A fifth man, warehouse worker called Max, 25, who had just finished a night shift and went to Saturday's protests, also cleaned up, telling MailOnline he went there because it 'just felt like it was the right thing to do.' The volunteers, who brought their own cleaning products, only stopped and left when a professional cleaner - remarkably called Winston - also turned up this morning and he had been asked to do the job professionally. It came as the clean-up also began in Bristol as council crews removed BLM placards and used chemicals and spray to clean graffit off the plinth from which the statue of slave trader Edward Colston was torn down yesterday. Speaking to MailOnline today, Max : 'For me it was a decision I made last night. I worked during a long night shift and I received the news that the statue was being defaced. I just felt like it was the right thing to do. 'It was completely independent, I thought to myself I'd be the only one there. I didn't mean to antagonise or upset anyone to do it. When I got there I was pleased to see four young Army cadets already cleaning the statue. 'I did actually attend the Black Lives Matter protest on Saturday in support of the movement. I feel strongly to show solidarity. I understand the actions that carried on late into last night were that of a minority. 'But I will not have war memorials defaced. The violence and to see the anger and hatred towards the police was very, very hard to watch for me. It came to standing up for what's right.' Max added: 'We brought our own cleaning products and they weren't really up to the job. We only left because remarkably a gentleman called Winston asked us to stop because he'd been asked to do the job professionally.' Advertisement Just 24-hours after the mayhem in Westminster another Black Lives Matter protest took place in London yesterday. Thousands gathered outside the American Embassy, just south of the River Thames in Nine Elms, before heading back into Westminster, where further clashes with police took place. One officer was seen with blood pouring down his head after being hit by a traffic cone while mobile phone footage showed other officers being forced to run from a baying bottle-throwing mob. A dispersal order was enforced in Westminster until 6am this morning as riot police battled into the night to move a group of about 50 violent protesters on. Earlier in the day, Black Lives Matter protesters in Bristol had toppled a bronze statue of 17th century slave trader Edward Colston and rolled it into the harbour. The Prime Minister condemned the trouble in both cities. In a statement he the BLM protests were 'subverted by thuggery' and that the violence was a 'betrayal' of their cause. And last night English Defence League founder Tommy Robinson blasted the 'Soft-handed' police approach for failing to protect the Cenotaph and the Sir Winston Churchill statue. He told his followers on social media that he would be heading into London on Saturday, adding: 'I cannot believe what's come of our capital city. 'Attack that statue like you did in Bristol today and think there's not going to be a British public there to confront you about it, you're wrong. 'You watch next Saturday how many people turn up.' A group called the Democratic Football Lads Alliance, made up of football fans from around Britain, has pledged to form a protective ring around London's war memorials and statues to prevent them from being damaged in protests. The clean-up began in Bristol today as council teams removed BLM placards and used chemicals to clean off graffiti defacing the plinth that held the Edward Colston statue in Bristol, and another of Winston Churchill in London. On the Colston statue, Bristol Mayor Marvin Rees it will be fished out 'at some point' and it is 'highly likely' to end up in one of the city's museums - with a debate set to be held over what should replace it on the plinth. Speaking about the general public disorder, Home Secretary Priti Patel told Sky News: 'I think that is utterly disgraceful and that speaks to the acts of public disorder that actually have now become a distraction from the cause in which people are actually protesting about and trying to empathise and sympathise with. 'That is completely an unacceptable act and that speaks to the vandalism - again as we saw (on Saturday) in London - but sheer vandalism and disorder completely is unacceptable. And it's right the police follow up on that and make sure that justice is taken with those individuals responsible for such disorderly and lawless behaviour.' The shocking images come as global demonstrations intensify after George Floyd, a 46-year-old black man, died after police officer Derek Chauvin put his knee on his neck in Minneapolis on May 25 for nine minutes. Demonstrators flouted social distancing rules yesterday to flood the streets around the US Embassy in London before marching on Westminster, protesting against racial injustice and police brutality. While the majority of the protests remained peaceful, violence erupted yet again, with images showing police and demonstrators suffering injuries during the melee which led to 12 arrests and eight officers being injured. The Metropolitan Police confirmed the majority of the arrests had been made for public order offences and one was for criminal damage following the incident at the Cenotaph. Also yesterday, images showed Black Lives Matter protesters tearing down a statue of 17th century slave trader and philanthropist Edward Colston in Bristol and dumping it in the harbour. Footage showed demonstrators, packed closely together - despite social distancing guidelines, heaving the metal monument down with ropes before cheering and dancing around it, with many placing their knees on the fallen statue as it lay on the ground - in a nod to the death of Mr Floyd. Marvin Rees, the Mayor of Bristol, told BBC Radio Bristol today: 'It's still underwater. At some point it will (be fished out) but we've a number of priorities in the city at the moment, not least trying to face up to an £80million gap in our budget that we've been left with by national Government not funding us adequately for Covid.' He added: 'I think that there's a really incredible opportunity to talk about ourselves and to make a decision about what we think should go on a plinth in the city to tell us about who we are, not just who we are but who we want to be and to really use that as a place to celebrate something about ourselves, the best of ourselves. 'What I would look forward to is having that city discussion. In the meantime it's highly likely that the Colston statue will end up in one of our museums.' But Government minister for crime and policing Kit Malthouse told BBC Breakfast: 'A crime was committed, criminal damage was committed, there should be evidence gathered and a prosecution should follow.' 'There is an elected mayor of Bristol, there is a council in Bristol and it is via those democratic means that we will resolve these issues in this country - not by people showing up with ropes and tools and committing criminal damage. We have to have a sense of order and democracy - that is how we sort things out and that is what should have happened.' But Labour's shadow justice secretary David Lammy told ITV's Good Morning Britain: 'I do absolutely support protest in the incident of the Colston statue. This is a man who transported over 80,000 African men women and children. It's shameful, shameful - we're actually discussing whether he should have a statue. People have been calling for that statue to come down in Bristol for many years. There may be a role for statues such as this in museums where there is proper context where they can think about their contribution to society as well as what they got wrong.'

But she added: 'There are no excuses for the unlawful behaviour and disorder we have witnessed throughout the weekend including the disgraceful vandalism we saw in Bristol and the utterly appalling abuse of our police officers.' Commenting on the desecration of Churchill's statue, she added: 'Winston Churchill is one of the greatest Britons who ever lived. We have him to thank for our very freedom to protest. The vandals who did this are repulsive criminals who I want to see brought to justice immediately.' Police officers had suffered 'serious injuries' inflicted by 'a small minority of violent people using the guise of peaceful protest to pursue reckless lawlessness,' she . She added: 'I know that the British public will be as appalled as I am at those scenes.' Outside Downing Street some demonstrators were seen turning violent as police officers tried to control the mass chaos and form a barricade with their riot shields.

He tweeted: 'People have a right to protest peacefully & while observing social distancing but they have no right to attack the police. 'These demonstrations have been subverted by thuggery - and they are a betrayal of the cause they purport to serve. Those responsible will be held to account.' Hours after the incident that saw the statue of Edward Colston pulled down in Bristol, the M6 in the Midlands was closed as Black Lives Matter protesters walked down the carriageway. A video posted on social media showed crowds of people covering the motorway at the Exhall interchange near Coventry as traffic remained stationary on the other side. Flares are launched into the air as police and demonstrators clash during Black Lives Matter protest in the nation's capital today Members of the police force attempt to disperse the crowds as a demonstrator climbs onto the national war monument in London One eyewitness claimed there were around 100 people who were heard chanting 'Black Lives Matter' as they took part in the demonstrations. Many drivers on the motorway were pictured emerging from their cars to watch the protests, which began at around 5pm, and the southbound carriageway was closed for around two hours. Today spokesperson for the protests in London, Superintendent Jo Edwards, : 'Regrettably officers were faced with further scenes of violence and disorder following a day of predominantly peaceful protest throughout the capital. 'This is a hugely impassioned movement and we understand the public's desire to have their voices heard – however it is not right that this passion has turned into violent attacks on officers. 'I would like to thank our officers, and those from the City of London Police and British Transport Police for their professionalism in the face of entirely unacceptable behaviour. 'Overnight our policing operation will continue and I would urge demonstrators thinking of returning to stay at home. The threat of Coronavirus remains very real, and we need you to protect yourselves, your friends and your family.' As the chaos continued, one protester, who took part in defacing the statue of the former Prime Minister Winston Churchill, was heard on camera saying: 'Tagged up Churchill as a racist on the statue of Churchill because he is a confirmed racist. 'He didn't fight the Nazis for the commonwealth or for anything else or for any personal freedoms. He fought the Nazis purely to protect the commonwealth against the invasion by foreign forces. He didn't do it for black people or people of colour. He did it purely for colonialism. 'People will be angry but at the end of the day I'm angry that for many years we've been oppressed. You can't enslave people, have the largest colonial empire ever in history and they try and come like ''yeah let's be peaceful'' it don't work like that.'

In a statement yesterday the police chief : 'I am deeply saddened and depressed that a minority of protesters became violent towards officers in central London yesterday evening. 'This led to 14 officers being injured, in addition to 13 hurt in earlier protests this week. 'We have made a number of arrests and justice will follow. I know many who were seeking to make their voices heard will be as appalled as I am by those scenes. 'I would urge protesters to please find another way to make your views heard which does not involve coming out on the streets of London, risking yourself, your families and officers as we continue to face [the deadly coronavirus].' Following the destruction of the statue in Bristol today former Chancellor of the Exchequer Sajid Javid condemned protesters' decision to force it down, declaring on Twitter: 'This is not OK'. Speaking after the demonstration, superintendent Andy Bennett vowed there would be an investigation into the 'act of criminal damage,' near Bristol Harbourside, where slave ships once docked centuries ago.

McConnell appears to be more set on convicting Trump in an extraordinary turn against the president in the wake of last week's Capitol riot. A Tuesday night report from Axios cited a top Republican close to McConnell saying, 'The Senate institutional loyalists are fomenting a counterrevolution' to Trump. McConnell has been signaling support for the House Democratic impeachment effort that includes an article charging the president with 'incitement of insurrection'. The news comes on the heels of a New York Times report that McConnell told associates he believes Trump 'committed impeachable offenses' and he’s 'pleased' by the move to impeach him. Also on Tuesday Rep. Liz Cheney, the House's third-ranking Republican, announced that she would vote for impeaching President Trump. 'On January 6, 2021 a violent mob attacked the United States Capitol to obstruct the process of our democracy and stop the counting of presidential electoral votes. This insurrection caused injury, death and destruction in the most sacred space in our Republic,' wrote Cheney, the daughter of the former vice president. U.S. President Donald Trump disembarks from Air Force One at Joint Base Andrews in Maryland, after visiting the U.S.-Mexico border wall in Harlingen, Texas, Tuesday President Donald Trump returns to the White House on Marine One in Washington, D.C Tuesday Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is signaling support for the House Democratic impeachment effort that includes an article charging the president with 'incitement of insurrection'. Trump retyrns to the White House on Tuesday evening Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell denounced Trump's election challenge in a speech last week after a mob egged on by Trump invaded the U.S. Capitol Also on Tuesday Rep. Liz Cheney, the House's third-ranking Republican, announced that she would vote for impeaching President Trump 'Much more will become clear in coming days and weeks, but what we know now is enough. The President of the United States summoned this mob, assembled the mob, and lit the flame of this attack. Everything that followed was his doing. None of this would have happened without the President. The President could have immediately and forcefully intervened to stop the violence. He did not. There has never been a greater betrayal by a President of the United States of his office and his oath to the Constitution,' she continued. 'I will vote to impeach the President,' Cheney concluded. Word of the powerful Senate Republican's posture came Tuesday as the House prepared prepared to take up an impeachment article Wednesday – with signs that several Republicans will back it. McConnell worked successfully to scuttle the impeachment effort during a trial last year on different charges. His current view follows reports that McConnell never wants to speak to Trump again after the Capitol riots that had Trump supporters invading the Capitol, trashing leadership offices, and endangering the lives of lawmakers. McConnell backs the effort because it will make it easier to purge Trump from the party, the New York Times reports. One feature of impeachment – which can grind the Senate to a halt and lead to furious partisan arguments – is that it allows lawmakers to vote to prohibit the person being impeached from ever holding public office with the U.S. government. Trump may run for president in 2024, and many of his potential rivals happen to hold Senate seats. McConnell has made clear in private discussions that 'now is the moment to move on the weakened lame duck, whom he blames for Republicans losing the Senate,' according to the report. His view emerged as Trump, rather than express contrition, called impeachment a 'hoax' and a 'witch hunt,' and defended his pre-riot comments that Democrats have already was incitement. Trump called his speech minutes before the siege 'totally appropriate.' U.S. President Donald Trump disembarks from a helicopter before boarding Air Force One at Valley International Airport after visiting the U.S.-Mexico border wall, in Harlingen, Texas, U.S., January 12, 2021. A pro-Trump mob invaded the Capitol last week, with angry rioters stopped just feet short of the Senate chamber and McConnell's leadership office Nevertheless, a McConnell memo that emerged over the weekend cited scheduling challenges for impeachment – a trial might not even begin until after Jan. 19th, since the Senate is not in session. Trump ignored McConnell's advice and launched his election challenge despite two run-off elections in Georgia which the GOP lost – stripping the party of its majority. McConnell's wife, Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao, quit the Trump cabinet after the riots, which included an angry mob getting blocked steps from the door to the Senate chamber that McConnell uses when he normally strolls from his leadership office. A source told CNN McConnell 'hates' Trump and is 'furious' with him after the Capitol riots. Cheney's statement denouncing the president comes after he told supporters they need to 'get rid' of people like her. 'We got to get rid of the weak Congresspeople, the ones that aren't any good, the Liz Cheneys of the world. We got to get rid of them,' Trump . House Speaker Nancy Pelosi praised her, amid speculation numerous House Republicans might follow her lead. 'Good for her for honoring her oath of us. Would that more Republicans would honor their oaths of office,' Pelosi . 'THE PRESIDENT LIT THE FLAME.' GOP NO.3 LIZ CHENEY'S STATEMENT IN FULL On January 6, 2021 a violent mob attacked the United States Capitol to obstruct the process of our democracy and stop the counting of presidential electoral votes. This insurrection caused injury, death and destruction in the most sacred space in our Republic. Much more will become clear in coming days and weeks, but what we know now is enough. The President of the United States summoned this mob, assembled the mob, and lit the flame of this attack. Everything that followed was his doing. None of this would have happened without the President. The President could have immediately and forcefully intervened to stop the violence. He did not. There has never been a greater betrayal by a President of the United States of his office and his oath to the Constitution. I will vote to impeach the President. Advertisement The siege left five people dead, including a U.S. Capitol Police officer who was based on the Senate side. It was not immediately clear how McConnell might vote on impeachment. Convicting Trump on an impeachment article requires a two-thirds vote of the Senate, where Republicans hold 50 votes – a high bar to meet. Report on his potential thinking follows reports that a House GOP leader, Conference Chair Rep. Liz Cheney, could potentially back impeachment, after calling it a conscience vote that leaders would not whip. She, like McConnell, put out a blistering statement following the Capitol riots. The House is set to vote Tuesday on a procedure for impeachment after an angry clash at the Rules Committee over Trump's claims of election fraud. The full House is set to vote Wednesday on impeachment. Assuming passage, it has not been determined when Democratic leaders will transmit the impeachment article, or when the Senate might take it up. Amid concern among members of both parties about what Trump will do in his final eight days in office, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Mark Milley and other top military members issued a letter stating that the military would not follow any unlawful orders and expressing loyalty to the U.S. Constitution. The FBI has warned of possible plans for additional attacks on the Capitol – and announced an array of charges that could include sedition, conspiracy, and murder, along with trespassing and property theft in ongoing manhunt for Capitol riot perpetrators. More than 160 cases are currently open. Just as news broke of McConnell's posture, it was revealed that upstate New York Republican Rep. John Katko would back impeachment in the House. 'To allow the president of the United States to incite this attack without consequence is a direct threat to the future of our democracy,' Katko in a statement, Syracuse.com reported. “For that reason, I cannot sit by without taking action. I will vote to impeach this president,' he . President-elect Joe Biden Monday there was the possibility of dual-tracking an impeachment and Senate session that would be needed to get his cabinet confirmed. Biden phoned McConnell on Monday, according to the Times on the subject of a trial, and McConnell he would consult the Senate parliamentarian and get back. There are Senate rules and precedents governing impeachment, but leaders also might be able to negotiate a way to handle it, with the possibility of a special impeachment committee taking up some of the burden. Trump has continued his usual pattern of lashing out at political adversaries when under attack. 'Free speech is under assault like never before. The 25th Amendment is of zero risk to me, but will come back to haunt Joe Biden and the Biden Administration. As the expression goes, be careful what you wish for,' Trump , amid a Democratic push to have Vice President Mike Pence invoke the amendment to declare Trump unfit. Post-riot accounts from last Wednesday reveal that not only did President Trump egg on supporters who wreaked havoc in the Capitol – but he was glued to the television as the events unfolded, incapable of responding to desperate pleas to use influence to stop it and enjoying seeing it unfold. There were two major areas where the president fell dramatically short of what was being asked of him: using his personal popularity with his followers to urge them to vacate the Capitol immediately; and using the vast powers of his office to try to speed a federal response. But when key current and former aides and family members tried to reach him, he was 'busy enjoying the spectacle,' according to a Washington Post account. What Trump told supporters before they ransacked the Capitol in 'totally appropriate' speech We're going to have to fight much harder 'Republicans are constantly fighting like a boxer with his hands tied behind his back. It's like a boxer. And we want to be so nice. We want to be so respectful of everybody, including bad people. And we're going to have to fight much harder.' We're going to walk down to the Capitol 'We're going to walk down to the Capitol, and we're going to cheer on our brave senators and congressmen and women, and we're probably not going to be cheering so much for some of them, because you'll never take back our country with weakness. You have to show strength, and you have to be strong. 'Get tougher' / You are allowed to go by very different rules 'The Republicans have to get tougher. You’re not going to have a Republican Party if you don’t get tougher. They want to play so straight. They want to play so serious. “The United States, the Constitution doesn’t allow me to send them back to the states.” Well, I would yes, it does, because the Constitution you have to protect our country, and you have to protect our Constitution, and you can’t vote on fraud, and fraud breaks up everything, doesn’t it? When you catch somebody in a fraud, you are allowed to go by very different rules. So I hope Mike has the courage to do what he has to do, and I hope he doesn’t listen to the RINOs and the stupid people that he’s listening toWhen you catch somebody in a fraud, you are allowed to go by very different rules. So I hope Mike has the courage to do what he has to do, and I hope he doesn't listen to the RINOs and the stupid people that he's listening to.' Takes 'more courage not to step up' 'I also want to thank our 13 most courageous members of the U.S. Senate ... I actually think, though, it takes, again, more courage not to step up, and I think a lot of those people are going to find that out. And you better start looking at your leadership, because your leadership has led you down the tubes.' Never concede 'We will never give up. We will never concede. It doesn't happen. You don't concede when there's theft involved. Our country has had enough.' On 'fake news' and 'Big tech' 'They rigged an election, they rigged it like they have never rigged an election before.' 'All of us here today do not want to see our election victory stolen by bold and radical left Democrats, which is what they are doing, and stolen by the fake news media. That is what they have done and what they are doing. We will never give up. We will never concede. It doesn’t happen. You don’t concede when there’s theft involved.' 'We will not take it anymore' 'Our country has had enough. We will not take it anymore, and that is what this is all about.' And to use a favorite term that all of you people really came up with, we will stop the steal.' Denied Biden's vote count 'He had 80 million computer votes. It’s a disgrace. There’s never been anything like that. You can take Third World countries, just take a look, take Third World countries, their elections are more honest than what we have been going through in this country. It’s a disgrace. It’s a disgrace. Even when you look at last night, they were all running around like chickens with their heads cut off with boxes, and nobody knows what the hell is going on. There’s never been anything like this. We will not let them silence your voices. We’re not going to let it happen.' [Note: Biden got more than 81 million votes; Trump rounded up his own total to 75 million.] Call for military and law enforcement to join 'And I would love to have, if those tens of thousands of people would be allowed, the military, the Secret Service and we want to thank you — and the police and law enforcement — great, you’re doing a great job. But I would love it if they could be allowed to come up with us. Is that possible? Can you just let them, please?' Pressure on Mike Pence: it takes 'courage' to do nothing 'I hope Mike is going to do the right thing. I hope so. I hope so because if Mike Pence does the right thing, we win the election ... All Vice President Pence has to do is send it back to the states to re-certify, and we become president, and you are the happiest people.' 'And I actually, I just spoke to Mike. I , Mike, that doesn’t take courage, what takes courage is to do nothing. That takes courage, and then we are stuck with a president who lost the election by a lot, and we have to live with that for four more years. We’re just not going to let that happen.' Won't stand for Biden win 'We want to go back, and we want to get this right, because we’re going to have somebody in there that should not be in there, and our country will be destroyed. And we’re not going to stand for that.' 'You're not the people that tore down our nation' 'If this happened to the Democrats, there’d be hell all over the country going on. There’d be hell all over the country. But just remember this, you’re stronger, you’re smarter. You’ve got more going than anybody, and they try and demean everybody having to do with us, and you’re the real people. You’re the people that built this nation. You’re not the people that tore down our nation.' March peacefully ... we will see whether Republicans stand strong 'I know that everyone here will soon be marching over to the Capitol building to peacefully and patriotically make your voices heard. Today, we will see whether Republicans stand strong for the integrity of our elections. But whether or not they stand strong for our country — our country, our country has been under siege for a long time. Far longer than this four-year period' 'Ashamed ... throughout eternity' 'Today, we see a very important event, though, because right over there, right there, we see the event that’s going to take place, and I’m going to be watching because history is going to be made. We’re going to see whether or not we have great and courageous leaders or whether or not we have leaders that should be ashamed of themselves throughout history, throughout eternity. They’ll be ashamed. And you know what? If they do the wrong thing, we should never, ever forget that they did. Never forget.' Calls Republicans who voted not to count certified votes 'warriors' 'I want to thank the more than 140 members of the House. Those are warriors.15 They’re over there working like you’ve never seen before, studying, talking, actually going all the way back studying the roots of the Constitution because they know we have the right to send a bad vote that was illegally gotten.' Biden will be 'illegitimate' 'But think of this: If you don’t do that, that means you will have a president of the United States for four years with his wonderful son, you will have a president who lost all of these states, or you will have a president, to put it another way, who was voted on by a bunch of stupid people who lost all of these states. You will have an illegitimate president. That is what you will have, and we can’t let that happen.' Call to 'do something' about radical left 'The radical left knows exactly what they were doing. They are ruthless, and it’s time that somebody did something about it. And Mike Pence, I hope you’re going to stand up for the good of our Constitution and for the good of our country. (APPLAUSE) And if you’re not, I’m going to be very disappointed in you. I will tell you right now. I’m not hearing good stories.' Election was 'stolen' 'Make no mistake, this election was stolen from you, from me, and from the country, and not a single swing state has conducted a comprehensive audit to remove the illegal ballots. This should absolutely occur in every single contested state before the election is certified.' Alleges 'criminal enterprise' 'So, when you hear — when you hear, “While there is no evidence to prove any wrongdoing,” this is the most fraudulent thing anybody’s — this is a criminal enterprise. This is a criminal enterprise.' Fight like hell 'And again, most people would stand there at 9 o’clock in the evening and , “I want to thank you very much,” and they go off to some other life. But I something is wrong here, something is really wrong, can’t have happened, and we fight. We fight like hell, and if you don’t fight like hell you’re not going to have a country anymore.' Advertisement President Donald Trump called his pre-riot remarks 'totally appropriate' President Donald Trump was glued to the television at the White House as his supporters ransacked the Capitol As the historic mob invasion of the U.S. seat of legislative government unfolded, a variety of people with influence over Trump sought to get to him to urge action. The routes they took were typical of the loosely organized web of influence within the Trump White House. Trump ally Sen. Lindsey Graham – who only after the riot firmly declared Joe Biden the winner of the election – reached out to the president's daughter, Ivanka Trump. 'It took him a while to appreciate the gravity of the situation,' Graham told the Post. 'The president saw these people as his allies in his journey and sympathetic to the idea that the election was stolen,' Graham of the rioters who took the Capitol. House Minority Leader Rep. Kevin McCarthy, who Trump believes is so much under his wing that he has publicly called him 'My Kevin,' was pleading for action. Trump had told supporters to 'fight' and encouraged them to march to the Capitol Pro-Trump supporters storm the U.S. Capitol following a rally with President Donald Trump on January 6, 2021 in Washington, DC. Protesters attempt to enter the U.S. Capitol Building on January 06, 2021 in Washington, DC. Pro-Trump protesters entered the U.S. Capitol building after mass demonstrations in the nation's capital during a joint session Congress to ratify President-elect Joe Biden's 306-232 Electoral College win over President Donald Trump. One Capitol Police officer died in the action Police officers in riot gear line up as protesters gather on the U.S. Capitol Building on January 06, 2021 in Washington, DC. It took hours to regain control of the building Senator Lindsey Graham reached out to Ivanka Trump during the chaos House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) pleaded with Trump during the riot Chief of staff Mark Meadows urged Trump to speak out after an aide told him 'They are going to kill people' in reference to the rioters McCarthy phoned Trump directly to try to plead for assistance – but also called the president's son in law, Jared Kushner, who was returning form a trip to the Middle East. Former counselor to the president Kellyanne Conway, who doesn't even work for Trump anymore, tried to get through to him to urge action. She phoned an aide she knew was in close proximity to Trump. The office of the Mayor of Washington, desperate to get more National Guard forces amid logistical and jurisdictional hurdles, also reached out to Conway. Chief of staff Mark Meadows urged Trump to speak out after an aide told him: 'They are going to kill people,' in reference to the rioters. A primary area of the pleas related to something Trump was capable of doing on his own without engaging with the bureaucracy: issuing simple Twitter or video pleas for protesters to get out of the Capitol. The appeals he finally made either lacked a direct call to fall back, or sprinkled in approving language even as the riot that would become deadly unfolded. At 2:30 pm, about half an hour after the Capitol breach, Trump told his supporters to 'Please support our Capitol Police' and to 'Stay peaceful!' His next message was more explicit, writing 'No violence!' – but claimed 'WE are the Party of Law & Order.' After he finally put out a video at about 4 pm, Trump finally told his backers to 'go home.' But he also called them 'very special,' called the election 'fraudulent,' and : 'You see the way others are treated that are so bad and so evil. I know how you feel. But go home, and go home in peace.' Trump himself had egged on his supporters with demands that they 'fight,' calling the election fraudulent, and putting pressure on Vice President Mike Pence, whose only role was ceremonial and involved opening and reading from envelopes containing electoral votes. Trump was glued to the television as the storming of the Capitol was broadcast. Prior reporting has revealed that the Washington D.C. government had requested a National Guard presence, but Guard were assigned to traffic and other assistance and weren't issued ammo or riot gear. The now resigned chief of Capitol Police he wanted more Guard support in advance of Wednesday but had been told by superiors to ask for it informally. The governor of Maryland, Larry Hogan, there were delays getting approval to send Guard forces from the Pentagon. But it wasn't mere distraction that kept Trump from springing into action. It's not atht he was too busy because he was so consumed, which he was,' the New York Times reported. 'He was pleased because it was people fighting on his behalf. He was pleased because he liked the scene. And he was pleased because it was delaying the certification of the Electoral College vote,' the New York Times reported. 'He knew what was happening... He just didn't want to do anything.' Although McCarthy told colleagues on a call Monday Trump had accepted 'some responsibility' for the riot, on Tuesday the president was back to his defiant posture familiar from impeachment and the Russia probe. He a second impeachment Democrats are lining up is a 'continuation of the greatest witch hunt in the history of politics.'"", ""A sixth Republican revealed he would vote to impeach President Donald Trump, but the president's Senate trial won't start until after President-elect Joe Biden is sworn in. Rep. Dan Newhouse of Washington Wednesday afternoon that he would vote yes on impeachment. 'Turning a blind eye to this brutal assault on our Republic is not an option,' Newhouse . 'A vote against impeachment is a vote to validate this unacceptable violence we witnessed in our nation's capital,' Newhouse in a statement. 'It is also a vote to condone President Trump's inaction. He did not strongly condemn the attack nor did he call in reinforcements when our officers were overwhelmed.' IMPEACHMENT TIMETABLE Wednesday afternoon: House passed single Article What happens next?

Senate procedures may mean trial will not begin until the following day at 1pm Wednesday January 20, noon: Trump leaves office What happens next? If a trial is under way, it can continue. Most legal experts if it has not begun, it can, but there is a minority who impeachment cannot continue if the president is not in office Advertisement 'Our country needed a leader and President Trump failed to fulfill his oath of office,' Newhouse added. His remarks were applauded on the House floor. Earlier, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell's spokesman confirmed that McConnell informed Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer that he wouldn't bring the Senate back before January 19, the day before Biden's inauguration. The revelation came after the House cleared procedural hurdles and debate started leading up to an expected Wednesday afternoon impeachment vote. Overall, six Republicans are expected to join the Democrats in voting to impeach Trump for a second time over his role in 'inciting an insurrection,' just one week after the MAGA mob stormed Capitol Hill. The White House put out a statement from Trump, trying to quell future violence as the House debated. 'In light of reports of more demonstrations, I urge that there must be NO violence, NO lawbreaking and NO vandalism of any kind. That is not what I stand for, and it is not what America stands for. I call on ALL Americans to help ease tensions and calm tempers. Thank You,' the president's statemet . House Speaker Nancy Pelosi called Trump a 'clear and present danger,' as Democrats they were standing in a 'crime scene' and Trump needed to pay a price for a campaign of 'lies and conspiracy theories,' which had fomented violence. Trump's Republican allies did not defend Trump's behavior, but instead pitched censuring the president or launching a 9/11-style commission, more fitting punishments they argued for someone who was already leaving office. Rep. Chip Roy, a Texas Republican, went as far to Trump's conduct was impeachable, but wouldn't vote for the article, calling it 'flawed.' The Republican revolt was led by Rep. Liz Cheney, the number three in the caucus, who issued a fiery denunciation of Trump when she announced her vote, saying he 'lit the flame on insurrection.' Members of the House walked into the chamber past rows of National Guard members sleeping holding their rifles, while outside thousands of troops surrounded the building, the first time troops have been stationed in it since the Civil War. In the Senate, which will have to hold a trial of Trump in the wake of the vote as soon as it receives the article, McConnell is to be leaning 'more than 50/50' towards convicting Trump, to 'purge' the party of him. McConnell confirmed that reporting by leaving the door open to convict. 'While the press has been full of speculation, I have not made a final decision on how I will vote and I intend to listen to the legal arguments when they are presented to the Senate,' read a memo McConnell sent to his GOP Senate colleagues. How many other Republicans are on board is unknown, with only Sen. Mitt Romney certain so far to back impeachment, while on Wednesday Sen. Lindsey Graham accused McConnell of risking more violence by backing impeachment. In the first procedural vote of the day in the House, Democrats voted en masse 221 to 205 against a Republican effort to install a commission. A second procedural hurdle was also passed with only Democratic votes. Rep. Tom Cole, the first GOP lawmaker to speak, argued against a hasty impeachment vote 'not because of the president's inappropriate and reckless words are deserving of defense but because the presidency itself demands due process.' Cole had himself voted to overturn the election results. Republicans also warned impeaching Trump for a second time would only make partisan hostilities worse. 'This is a reckless impeachment,' complained Republican Rep. Jason Smith of Missouri. 'This will only bring up the hate and fire more than ever before.' Republican Rep. Andy Biggs of Arizona charged Democrats with wanting 'complete destruction of your nemesis.' 'Instead of stopping the Trump train, his movement will go stronger, for you would have made him a martyr,' Biggs warned. Democrats described the terror of last week's attack. 'We are debating this resolution at an actual crime scene and we wouldn’t be here if not for the president of the United States,' Rep. Jim McGovern, a Massachusetts Democrat. 'People were sending text messages to their loved ones, telling them they loved them. They thought they were saying goodbye,' he added. The House of Representatives began debating impeaching President Donald Trump for a second time Wednesday morning - which marks a historic first House Speaker Nancy Pelosi opened Wednesday afternoon's session and President Donald Trump represented a 'clear and present danger' Rep.

Reclaimed district from Dems in 2020 Advertisement Democratic Rep. Jamie Raskin, the House's lead impeachment manager, referred to the rioters as a 'bloodthirsty mob.' 'They wounded dozens of people, hospitalizing dozens of people,' he . 'They may have been hunting for Pence and Pelosi to stage their coup, but every one of us in this room right now, could have died.' Rep. Joaquin Castro echoed Raskin's description. 'Let me ask you a question? What do you think they would have done if they had gotten in? What do you think they would have done to you? And who do you think sent them here?' he asked his fellow members. 'The most dangerous man to ever occupy the Oval Office.' Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, speaking to an InstagramLive audience Tuesday night since she was proxy voting, , 'I can tell you that I had a very close encounter where I thought I was going to die.' 'I did not know if I was going to make it to the end of that day alive,' the high-profile progressive lawmaker . On the floor Wednesday, the Democrats pointed to the Republicans' high-profile defection: the No. 3 House Republican, Cheney. Cheney, the Republican Conference Chair, laced into Trump in her statement, saying he 'lit the flame' of insurrection - and Democrats repeated her words back to the Republicans. 'There has never been a greater betrayal by a President of the United States of his office and his oath to the Constitution,' she . The decision to back impeachment by Cheney, a member of Republican royalty as the daughter of Dick Cheney, and seen as a future contender for the party's House leadership and the Speaker's chair, means that impeachment would be bipartisan. On the floor Wednesday, Democrats pointed to Cheney's statement as evidence they were in the right. The Democrats' No. 2, Rep. Steny Hoyer, recited Cheney's words during his turn to speak. 'That is not some irresponsible new member of Congress of the United States,' Hoyer . 'This is the daughter of the former Republican whip and former vice president of the United States of America.' 'She knows of which she speaks,' Hoyer argued. Reps. Jim Jordan and Paul Gosar, two of Trump's top GOP House allies, were pushing to have Cheney removed from her leadership position. JIM JORDAN DEMOCRATS WANT TO 'CANCEL' THE PRESIDENT Jordan gave two fiery floor speeches Wednesday. He yelled '19 minutes!' into the microphone Wednesday afternoon, charging Democrats with waiting just 19 minutes into the Trump administration to start their impeachment hunt. He Democrats were pursuing removal again because of 'politics and the fact that they want to, they want to cancel the president.' 'This is about getting the president of the United States,' Jordan . 'They spied on his campaign before he was elected, 19 minutes into his presidency they started the impeachment push, three year Mueller investigation, 19 lawyers, 40 agents, 500 witnesses, 2,500 subpoenas, $40 million to find nothing,' Jordan went on. The Ohio Republican impeachment 'round one' was based on information from a 'biased' whistleblower. 'Now it's impeachment round two,' he . 'It's always been about getting the president, no matter what. It's an obsession, an obsession that's now broadened. It's not just about impeachment anymore it's about canceling ... canceling the president,' Jordan argued. 'IT BREAKS MY HEART' HOUSE SPEAKER NANCY PELOSI Pelosi, who opened the formal impeachment articles debate, she wasn't pursuing the measure with glee. 'It gives me no pleasure to this, it breaks my heart. It should break your heart. It should break all of our hearts,' the top Democrat . Pelosi encouraged the Senate to act, calling the president a 'clear and present danger.' 'I believe the president must be convicted by the Senate, a constitutional remedy that will ensure that the republic will be safe from this man, that was so resolutely determined to tear down the things that we hold dear, and hold us together,' she . She also slammed those who engaged in the riot. 'Those insurrectionists were not patriots. They were not part of a political base to be catered to and managed. They were domestic terrorists and justice must prevail,' the House speaker . TOP HOUSE REPUBLICAN ANTIFA NOT RESPONSIBLE Pelosi's Republican counterpart, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, let other, more pro-Trump members speak before he took a turn on the floor, where he cleared up some right-wing misinformation. 'Some the riots were caused by Antifa,' McCarthy . 'There is absolutely no evidence of that. And conservatives should be the first to so,' he advised. McCarthy he planned to vote no on impeachment because it was too hasty. 'I believe impeaching the president in such a short timeframe would be a mistake,' McCarthy argued. 'No investigations have been completed. No hearings have been held.' 'What’s more, the Senate has confirmed that no trial will begin until after President-Elect Biden is sworn in,' McCarthy added, a nod to the breaking McConnell news. TRUMP'S TOP ALLIES POINT FINGERS BACK AT DEMOCRATS Most of the Republicans lining up to speak were Trump hard-liners - and pointed to what they considered to be Democratic hypocrisy. 'The left in America has incited far more political violence than the right for months. Our cities burned police stations burned or businesses were shattered. And they nothing,' Rep. Matt Gaetz yelled. 'Well they lit actual flames. Actual fires,' Gaetz exclaimed. That comment cued boos from the Democratic side. Rep. Ken Buck compared the capitol assault to Trump administration officials being harassed at restaurants. 'The press secretary Sarah Sanders was kicked out of a restaurant for being a Trump employee, the DHS Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen harassed at her home,' Buck on the floor. Nielsen was confronted by a crowd at a D.C. restaurant over the Trump administration's child separation policy. Rep. Lauren Boebert, who has openly supported the QAnon conspiracy theory, called for 'accountability on the left.' 'After encouraging and normalizing violence,' she . 'I call bull crap when I hear the Democrats demanding unity. Sadly they are only unified in hate,' she blasted. the other 'QAnon congresswoman,' Rep. Marjorie Taylor Green gave her floor remarks wearing a 'CENSORED' mask. Rep. Brian Mast, a Florida Republican, used a dramatic pause to make his point. 'Has any one of those individuals who brought violence on this capitol been brought here to answer whether they did that because of our president?' Mast asked. He stood unanswered for 30 seconds until his time elapsed. 'It appears I will receive no answer,' he . (SOME) REPUBLICANS REVOLT Joining Cheney in voting for the Democratic-prepared article of impeachment will be Adam Kinzinger of Illinois, John Katko of New York, Fred Upton of Michigan, Jaime Herrera Beutler of Washington and Newhouse of Washington. 'My vote to impeach our sitting president is not a fear-based decision,' Herrera Beutler during her floor speech. 'I am not choosing a side I am choosing, it's the only way to defeat fear.' The White House was bracing for more. Cheney's decision came minutes after McConnell was revealed to believe that Trump had committed impeachable offenses. The New York Times' bombshell was still echoing in Washington D.C. when the House started its 25th Amendment debate - and as it dragged to a close Tuesday night, Axios reported that McConnell was leaning towards a vote to convict the president and was 'more than 50/50' on it. Cheney was seen speaking to Raskin on Tuesday night as he led the Democrats arguing for a resolution urging Vice President Mike Pence to invoke the 25th Amendment removing Trump from power. The House passed it late Tuesday despite Pence sending a letter to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi saying he'll refuse. Hundreds of National Guard troops wer sleeping on the stone floor of the US Capitol on Wednesday morning as security in Washington intensified a week out from Joe Biden's inauguration The troops could be seen spreading out inside the Rotunda of the US Capitol on Wednesday morning The troops cradled their weapons and huddled together as they slept inside the Capitol on Wednesday In a vote that wrapped up around 11.30pm Tuesday, the House voted 223-205 to approve the resolution, which can't actually force the vice president's hand. 'I do not believe that such a course of action is in the best interest of our Nation or consistent with the Constitution,' Pence in his letter to Pelosi, refusing to pull the trigger on the 25th. 'Last week, I did not yield to pressure to exert beyond my constitutional authority to determine the outcome of the election, and I will not now yield to efforts in the House of Representatives to play political games at a time so serious in the life of our Nation,' Pence added. Pence's letter came as the House was holding procedural votes on the resolution. No Republicans joined on until the final vote - with Rep. Adam Kinzinger joining Democrats in the push to have Pence to use the 25th. Trump ultra-loyalist Jim Jordan he will try to oust Liz Cheney from her position as party's House number three in revenge for voting to impeach president Jim Jordan he wanted Republicans to remove Rep. Liz Cheney from her leadership position over her push to impeach President Donald Trump. 'I think she's, I think she's totally wrong,' Jordan . 'The conference should have a second vote on that,' the Ohio Republican told reporters, saying he believed lawmakers should get a on removing Cheney from her No. 3 position. Republican Rep. Paul Gosar, another top Trump ally, was circulating a petition to GOP members pushing for Cheney's removal, C-SPAN and CNN reported. The House Republican caucus held leadership elections for the 117th Congress on November 17, two weeks after Election Day. Cheney, again, was selected to be the Republican Conference chairman, and ran for the position unopposed. On Tuesday she announced she would side the the Democratic majority and vote to impeach Trump for 'incitement of insurrection.' In an explosive statement, the daughter of former Vice President Dick Cheney laced into Trump saying he 'lit the flame' of insurrection. 'There has never been a greater betrayal by a President of the United States of his office and his oath to the Constitution,' Cheney . Four other GOP House members have they will vote for Trump's impeachment: Reps. Adam Kinzinger, Fred Upton, John Katko and Jaime Herrera Beutler. Speaking to Capitol Hill reporters, Jordan was unsure if there was a mechanism to push a member out of leadership. 'I don't know about that - it's just where I'm at,' he told the press. When asked if the conservative Freedom Caucus, of which Jordan is a leader, was supportive of pushing Cheney out, Jordan replied sarcastically, 'What do you think?' 'You know the answer. You know the answer to that question,' he went on. 'Of course.' Jordan was also asked if Republicans had a 'cohesive leaderhip team' with House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy and Cheney appearing to be in direct conflict. 'Leader McCarthy and whip Scalise have done a great job,' Jordan answered. Rep. Steve Scalise is the No. 2 Republican in the House of Representatives. Jordan was recently given a Presidential Medal of Freedom behind closed doors by Trump. Both voted to overturn the election.

GOP NO.3 LIZ CHENEY'S STATEMENT IN FULL On January 6, 2021 a violent mob attacked the United States Capitol to obstruct the process of our democracy and stop the counting of presidential electoral votes. This insurrection caused injury, death and destruction in the most sacred space in our Republic. Much more will become clear in coming days and weeks, but what we know now is enough. The President of the United States summoned this mob, assembled the mob, and lit the flame of this attack. Everything that followed was his doing. None of this would have happened without the President. The President could have immediately and forcefully intervened to stop the violence. He did not. There has never been a greater betrayal by a President of the United States of his office and his oath to the Constitution. I will vote to impeach the President. Advertisement That set the scene for an impeachment debate and vote Wednesday entirely different from the first impeachment vote on October 31, 2019. Then the only non-Democratic vote was from Justin Amash, who was essentially forced out of the Republican party before he even cast it. But after a day in which they feared for their lives, the mood in Congress had changed rapidly. Tuesday's debate saw pro-Trump Republicans line up to back him - but party moderates conspicuously silent, and the Minority leader and his deputy Steve Scalise silent. The resolution blamed Trump for the violent MAGA mob that broke into Capitol Hill Wednesday, laying out how he 'broadly encouraged' his supporters to come to Washington on January 6, saying that the day would be 'wild.' 'Donald Trump has demonstrated repeatedly, continuously, and spectacularly his absolute inability to discharge the most basic and fundamental powers and duties of his office, including most recently the duty to respect the legitimate results of the Presidential election, the duty to respect the peaceful transfer of democratic power under the Constitution, the duty to participate in legally defined transition activities, the duty to protect and uphold the Constitution of the United States, including the counting of Electoral College votes by Congress, the duty to protect the people of the United States and their elected representatives against domestic insurrection, mob rule, and seditious violence, and generally the duty to take care that the laws be faithfully executed,' the resolution . Despite being targets in the violent incident, House Republicans lined up against passing the resolution. Rep. Tom Cole, a Republican from Oklahoma, called the resolution 'an attempt to pressure the vice president into performing a duty he clearly does not believe is necessary at this time.' As exasperated Rep. Pat Fallon, a new GOP lawmaker from Texas, Trump held a 'permitted, legal and peaceful rally,' refusing to blame him for the group of Trump supporters who mobbed the Capitol. Jordan, the Ohio Republican who recently was given a Presidential Medal of Freedom by Trump, lambasted the effort - and also the new fines for not wearing masks in the House chamber and the metal detectors that were installed Tuesday outside the doors of the House floor. In his letter to Pelosi, Pence argued that the 25th Amendment was supposed to address 'incapacity or disability.' The vice president pointed to the Democrats own effort to create a 25th Amendment Commission, which a president's fitness must be determined by 'science and facts' and '[v]ery respectful of not making a judgment on the basis of a comment or behavior we don't like, but based on a medical decision.' Pence also pledged that the administration's energy was dedicated to 'ensuring an orderly transition.' The vice president repeated an argument being pushed by a number of Capitol Hill Republicans - that pursuing removal of Trump would only make things worse. 'I urge you and every member of Congress to avoid actions that would further divide and inflame the passions of the moment,' Pence . 'Work with us to lower the temperature and unite our country as we prepare to inauguration President-elect Joe Biden as the next president of the United States.' House Speaker Nancy Pelosi was informed by Vice President Mike Pence that he would not invoke the 25th Amendment and remove President Donald Trump from office as the House was taking its first vote Tuesday night on a resolution that urges him to do so The House of Representatives voted late into the night Wednesday on a resolution that encourages Vice President Mike Pence to use the 25th Amendment and remove President Donald Trump from power Rep. Jim Jordan, an Ohio Republican, criticized the Democrats' effort to have Vice President Mike Pence utilize the 25th Amendment. He also complained about the House's new fines for lawmakers who don't wear masks - and the metal detectors outside the House chamber During Tuesday night's debate of the 25th Amendment resolution, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi also announced her impeachment managers, saying Rep. Jamie Raskin of Maryland would be leading the charge. Raskin tragically lost his son to suicide just days ago Rep. Jim Jordan, the Ohio Republican who recently was given a Presidential Medal of Freedom by Trump, lambasted the effort HOW TRUMP'S SECOND IMPEACHMENT WILL UNFOLD The House is expected to impeach President Donald Trump for his encouragement of supporters who stormed the U.S. Capitol, a vote that would make him the first American president to be impeached twice. While the previous three impeachments - those of Presidents Andrew Johnson, Bill Clinton and Trump - took months before a final vote, including investigations and hearings, this time it will have only taken a week. After the rioting at the Capitol, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi 'we must take action,' and Democrats - and some Republicans - share her view ahead of Wednesday's vote. For now, the Republican-led Senate is not expected to hold a trial and vote on whether to convict Trump before Democrat Joe Biden is sworn in as president Jan. 20. Still, Democrats feel that action by the House would send an important message to the country. A look at what will happen as the House moves closer to impeaching Trump in his last week in office: THE BASICS OF IMPEACHMENT: In normal order, there would be an impeachment investigation and the evidence would be sent to the House Judiciary Committee, which would hold hearings, draft articles and send them to the full House. That's what happened in 2019, when the House impeached Trump over his dealings with the president of Ukraine. It took three months. This time, with so few days to act - and a feeling among Democrats that there is little need to investigate what happened, since most members of Congress heard Trump speak to his supporters and were in the Capitol when the mob broke in - impeachment is going straight to the House floor for a vote, which would come as soon as Wednesday. Once the House votes to impeach, the articles and evidence would be sent to the Senate, where a trial would be held and there would be final votes to convict or acquit. That's what the Senate did in early February of last year after Trump was impeached the first time. THE ARTICLES Democrats will begin debate Wednesday on a single impeachment charge: 'incitement of insurrection.' 'President Trump gravely endangered the security of the United States and its institutions of Government,' reads the four-page impeachment article, which was introduced by Democratic Reps. David Cicilline of Rhode Island, Ted Lieu of California and Jamie Raskin of Maryland. 'He will remain a threat to national security, democracy, and the Constitution if allowed to remain in office,' it reads. The article the behavior is consistent with Trump's prior efforts to 'subvert and obstruct' the results of the election and references his recent call with the Georgia secretary of state, in which he he wanted him to find him more votes after losing the state to Biden. Trump has falsely claimed there was widespread fraud in the election, and the baseless claims have been repeatedly echoed by congressional Republicans and the insurgents who descended on the Capitol. Just before the riots, Trump spoke to the supporters near the White House and encouraged them to 'fight like hell.' As the protesters broke in, both chambers were debating GOP challenges to the electoral vote count in Arizona as part of the process for certifying Biden's election win. REPUBLICAN SUPPORT On Tuesday, five Republicans they would support impeachment. No Republicans supported Trump's first impeachment in 2019. Republican Rep. Liz Cheney of Wyoming, the No. 3 Republican in the House and the daughter of former Vice President Dick Cheney, she would vote to impeach Trump because 'there has never been a greater betrayal by a President of the United States of his office and his oath to the Constitution.' Cheney Trump 'summoned' the mob that attacked the Capitol last week, 'assembled the mob, and lit the flame of this attack.' New York Rep. John Katko was the first Republican to he'd vote to impeach. A former federal prosecutor, he he did not make the decision lightly. 'To allow the president of the United States to incite this attack without consequence is a direct threat to the future of our democracy,' Katko . 'I cannot sit by without taking action.' Also saying they would vote for impeachment were Reps. Adam Kinzinger of Illinois, Fred Upton of Michigan and Jaime Herrera Beutler of Washington. SENDING TO THE SENATE Once the House passes the articles, Pelosi can decide when she sends them to the Senate. Under the current schedule, the Senate is not set to resume full sessions until Jan. 19, which is the day before Biden's inauguration. Some Democrats suggested Pelosi might wait to send the articles and allow Biden to begin his term without impeachment hanging over him. But many other Democrats have urged Pelosi to move immediately. Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer, who will be in charge once Biden is sworn in, suggested in a letter to colleagues Tuesday the chamber might divide its time between confirming Biden's nominees, approving COVID relief and conducting the trial. If the trial isn't held until Trump is already out of office, it could still have the effect of preventing him from running for president again. Biden has it's important to ensure that the 'folks who engaged in sedition and threatening the lives, defacing public property, caused great damage — that they be held accountable.' SENATE POLITICS It's unlikely, for now, that enough Republicans would vote to convict, since two-thirds of the Senate is needed. Yet some Republicans have told Trump to resign, including Pennsylvania Sen. Pat Toomey and Alaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski, and few are defending him. Republican Sen. Ben Sasse has he would take a look at what the House approves, but stopped short of committing to support it. Other Republicans have that impeachment would be divisive. South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham, long a key ally of the president, has been critical of his behavior in inciting the riots but impeachment 'will do far more harm than good.' Only one Republican voted to convict Trump last year — Utah Sen. Mitt Romney. WHAT IMPEACHMENT WOULD MEAN Democrats they have to move forward, even if the Senate doesn't convict. Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders tweeted on Friday that some people might ask why they would try to impeach a president with only a few days left in office. 'The answer: Precedent,' he . 'It must be made clear that no president, now or in the future, can lead an insurrection against the U.S. government.' Advertisement In the hours after the riot, Pence did his Constitutional duty and certified President-elect Joe Biden, something he had been pressured by Trump not to do. 'You can either go down in history as a patriot,' Trump had told Pence by phone before he headed to the Capitol Wednesday, according to The New York Times. 'Or you can go down in history as a p****.' Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell signaled his support for impeachment, The New York Times reported Tuesday evening Pence was inside when the violent mobbed attacked, with some Trump supporters calling out, 'Hang Mike Pence.' The Times reported that Trump had invited Pence to the Oval Office Monday night to try to smooth things over in the run-up to the House's 25th Amendment vote. The official description of the meeting was 'good,' according to the newspaper. Unofficially sources called it 'nonsubstantive' and 'stilted.' Tuesday night's vote on the 25th Amendment is considered the appetizer for Wednesday's main course: the House pursuing impeachment again. Nowhere in his letter did Pence he objected to that move. Shortly after Pence sent out his letter, Pelosi sent out the names of impeachment managers. She picked Rep. Jamie Raskin, who introduced the 25th Amendment resolution, as the head manager. 'I think every member of this body should be able to agree that this president is not meeting the most minimal duties of office,' Raskin argued Tuesday night. Raskin also warned his fellow lawmakers that Trump could pardon the Capitol Hill attackers during his waning days. Raskin, a Maryland Democrat, recently lost his son. Additionally, Democratic Reps. Diana DeGette, David Cicilline, Joaquin Castro, Eric Swalwell, Ted Lieu, Stacey Plaskett, Joe Neguse and Madeleine Dean were also chosen. Earlier Tuesday, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell signaled his support for the impeachment effort that includes an article charging the president with 'incitement of insurrection.' The view of the GOP powerbroker emerged shortly before Rep. Liz Cheney, a member of the House GOP leadership, announced that she would vote for impeaching President Trump. 'On January 6, 2021 a violent mob attacked the United States Capitol to obstruct the process of our democracy and stop the counting of presidential electoral votes. This insurrection caused injury, death and destruction in the most sacred space in our Republic,' wrote Cheney, the daughter of the former vice president. 'Much more will become clear in coming days and weeks, but what we know now is enough. The President of the United States summoned this mob, assembled the mob, and lit the flame of this attack. Everything that followed was his doing. None of this would have happened without the President. The President could have immediately and forcefully intervened to stop the violence. He did not. There has never been a greater betrayal by a President of the United States of his office and his oath to the Constitution,' she continued. 'I will vote to impeach the President,' Cheney concluded. Neither Cheney nor McConnell backed Democrats impeachment effort a year ago. McConnell worked successfully to scuttle the impeachment effort during a trial last year on different charges. His current view follows reports that McConnell never wants to speak to Trump again after the Capitol riots that had Trump supporters invading the Capitol, trashing leadership offices, and endangering the lives of lawmakers. McConnell backs the effort because it will make it easier to purge Trump from the party, the New York Times reports. One feature of impeachment – which can grind the Senate to a halt and lead to furious partisan arguments – is that it allows lawmakers to vote to prohibit the person being impeached from ever holding public office with the U.S. government. Trump may run for president in 2024, and many of his potential rivals happen to hold Senate seats. McConnell has made clear in private discussions that 'now is the moment to move on the weakened lame duck, whom he blames for Republicans losing the Senate,' according to the report. Trump ignored McConnell's advice and launched his election challenge despite two run-off elections in Georgia which the GOP lost – stripping the party of its majority. A source told CNN McConnell 'hates' Trump and is 'furious' with him after the Capitol riots. The siege left five people dead, including a U.S. Capitol Police officer who was based on the Senate side. McConnell's wife, Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao, quit the Trump cabinet after the riots, which included an angry mob getting blocked steps from the door to the Senate chamber that McConnell uses when he normally strolls from his leadership office. It was not immediately clear how McConnell might vote on impeachment. McConnell's view emerged as Trump, rather than express contrition, called impeachment a 'hoax' and a 'witch hunt,' and defended his pre-riot comments that Democrats have already was incitement. Trump called his speech minutes before the siege 'totally appropriate.' Cheney's statement denouncing the president comes after Trump told supporters they need to 'get rid' of people like her. 'We got to get rid of the weak Congresspeople, the ones that aren't any good, the Liz Cheneys of the world. We got to get rid of them,' Trump . House Speaker Nancy Pelosi praised her, amid speculation numerous House Republicans might follow her lead. 'Good for her for honoring her oath of us. Would that more Republicans would honor their oaths of office,' Pelosi . GOP Rep. John Katko also announced he would back impeachment Tuesday night. 'To allow the president of the United States to incite this attack without consequence is a direct threat to the future of our democracy,' Katko in a statement, Syracuse.com reported. 'For that reason, I cannot sit by without taking action. I will vote to impeach this president,' he . During floor debate, Katko he wasn't supporting the 25th Amendment resolution because it was 'non-binding,' calling it 'merely a symbolic gesture.' Katko confirmed his plans to vote for impeachment. Michigan Republican Rep. Fred Upton also told Forbes he would vote to impeach. As midnight approached, Rep. Jaime Herrera Beutler also she was a yes. Convicting Trump on an impeachment article requires a two-thirds vote of the Senate, where Republicans hold 50 votes – a high bar to meet. Assuming passage in the House, it has not been determined when Democratic leaders will transmit the impeachment article, or when the Senate might take it up. A McConnell memo that emerged over the weekend cited scheduling challenges for impeachment – a trial might not even begin until after Jan. 19th, since the Senate is not in session. President-elect Joe Biden Monday there was the possibility of dual-tracking an impeachment and Senate session that would be needed to get his cabinet confirmed. Biden phoned McConnell on Monday, according to the Times on the subject of a trial, and McConnell he would consult the Senate parliamentarian and get back. There are Senate rules and precedents governing impeachment, but leaders also might be able to negotiate a way to handle it, with the possibility of a special impeachment committee taking up some of the burden. Trump has continued his usual pattern of lashing out at political adversaries when under attack. 'Free speech is under assault like never before. The 25th Amendment is of zero risk to me, but will come back to haunt Joe Biden and the Biden Administration. As the expression goes, be careful what you wish for,' Trump Tuesday, before lawmakers cast their votes Tuesday night. Post-riot accounts from last Wednesday reveal that not only did President Trump egg on supporters who wreaked havoc in the Capitol – but he was glued to the television as the events unfolded, incapable of responding to desperate pleas to use influence to stop it and enjoying seeing it unfold. There were two major areas where the president fell dramatically short of what was being asked of him: using his personal popularity with his followers to urge them to vacate the Capitol immediately; and using the vast powers of his office to try to speed a federal response. But when key current and former aides and family members tried to reach him, he was 'busy enjoying the spectacle,' according to a Washington Post account. What Trump told supporters before they ransacked the Capitol in 'totally appropriate' speech We're going to have to fight much harder 'Republicans are constantly fighting like a boxer with his hands tied behind his back. It's like a boxer. And we want to be so nice. We want to be so respectful of everybody, including bad people. And we're going to have to fight much harder.' We're going to walk down to the Capitol 'We're going to walk down to the Capitol, and we're going to cheer on our brave senators and congressmen and women, and we're probably not going to be cheering so much for some of them, because you'll never take back our country with weakness. You have to show strength, and you have to be strong. 'Get tougher' / You are allowed to go by very different rules 'The Republicans have to get tougher. You’re not going to have a Republican Party if you don’t get tougher. They want to play so straight. They want to play so serious. “The United States, the Constitution doesn’t allow me to send them back to the states.” Well, I would yes, it does, because the Constitution you have to protect our country, and you have to protect our Constitution, and you can’t vote on fraud, and fraud breaks up everything, doesn’t it? When you catch somebody in a fraud, you are allowed to go by very different rules. So I hope Mike has the courage to do what he has to do, and I hope he doesn’t listen to the RINOs and the stupid people that he’s listening toWhen you catch somebody in a fraud, you are allowed to go by very different rules. So I hope Mike has the courage to do what he has to do, and I hope he doesn't listen to the RINOs and the stupid people that he's listening to.' Takes 'more courage not to step up' 'I also want to thank our 13 most courageous members of the U.S. Senate ... I actually think, though, it takes, again, more courage not to step up, and I think a lot of those people are going to find that out. And you better start looking at your leadership, because your leadership has led you down the tubes.' Never concede 'We will never give up. We will never concede. It doesn't happen. You don't concede when there's theft involved. Our country has had enough.' On 'fake news' and 'Big tech' 'They rigged an election, they rigged it like they have never rigged an election before.' 'All of us here today do not want to see our election victory stolen by bold and radical left Democrats, which is what they are doing, and stolen by the fake news media. That is what they have done and what they are doing. We will never give up. We will never concede. It doesn’t happen. You don’t concede when there’s theft involved.' 'We will not take it anymore' 'Our country has had enough. We will not take it anymore, and that is what this is all about.' And to use a favorite term that all of you people really came up with, we will stop the steal.' Denied Biden's vote count 'He had 80 million computer votes. It’s a disgrace. There’s never been anything like that. You can take Third World countries, just take a look, take Third World countries, their elections are more honest than what we have been going through in this country. It’s a disgrace. It’s a disgrace. Even when you look at last night, they were all running around like chickens with their heads cut off with boxes, and nobody knows what the hell is going on. There’s never been anything like this. We will not let them silence your voices. We’re not going to let it happen.' [Note: Biden got more than 81 million votes; Trump rounded up his own total to 75 million.] Call for military and law enforcement to join 'And I would love to have, if those tens of thousands of people would be allowed, the military, the Secret Service and we want to thank you — and the police and law enforcement — great, you’re doing a great job. But I would love it if they could be allowed to come up with us. Is that possible? Can you just let them, please?' Pressure on Mike Pence: it takes 'courage' to do nothing 'I hope Mike is going to do the right thing. I hope so. I hope so because if Mike Pence does the right thing, we win the election ... All Vice President Pence has to do is send it back to the states to re-certify, and we become president, and you are the happiest people.' 'And I actually, I just spoke to Mike. I , Mike, that doesn’t take courage, what takes courage is to do nothing. That takes courage, and then we are stuck with a president who lost the election by a lot, and we have to live with that for four more years. We’re just not going to let that happen.' Won't stand for Biden win 'We want to go back, and we want to get this right, because we’re going to have somebody in there that should not be in there, and our country will be destroyed. And we’re not going to stand for that.' 'You're not the people that tore down our nation' 'If this happened to the Democrats, there’d be hell all over the country going on. There’d be hell all over the country. But just remember this, you’re stronger, you’re smarter. You’ve got more going than anybody, and they try and demean everybody having to do with us, and you’re the real people. You’re the people that built this nation. You’re not the people that tore down our nation.' March peacefully ... we will see whether Republicans stand strong 'I know that everyone here will soon be marching over to the Capitol building to peacefully and patriotically make your voices heard. Today, we will see whether Republicans stand strong for the integrity of our elections. But whether or not they stand strong for our country — our country, our country has been under siege for a long time. Far longer than this four-year period' 'Ashamed ... throughout eternity' 'Today, we see a very important event, though, because right over there, right there, we see the event that’s going to take place, and I’m going to be watching because history is going to be made. We’re going to see whether or not we have great and courageous leaders or whether or not we have leaders that should be ashamed of themselves throughout history, throughout eternity. They’ll be ashamed. And you know what? If they do the wrong thing, we should never, ever forget that they did. Never forget.' Calls Republicans who voted not to count certified votes 'warriors' 'I want to thank the more than 140 members of the House. Those are warriors.15 They’re over there working like you’ve never seen before, studying, talking, actually going all the way back studying the roots of the Constitution because they know we have the right to send a bad vote that was illegally gotten.' Biden will be 'illegitimate' 'But think of this: If you don’t do that, that means you will have a president of the United States for four years with his wonderful son, you will have a president who lost all of these states, or you will have a president, to put it another way, who was voted on by a bunch of stupid people who lost all of these states. You will have an illegitimate president. That is what you will have, and we can’t let that happen.' Call to 'do something' about radical left 'The radical left knows exactly what they were doing. They are ruthless, and it’s time that somebody did something about it. And Mike Pence, I hope you’re going to stand up for the good of our Constitution and for the good of our country. (APPLAUSE) And if you’re not, I’m going to be very disappointed in you. I will tell you right now. I’m not hearing good stories.' Election was 'stolen' 'Make no mistake, this election was stolen from you, from me, and from the country, and not a single swing state has conducted a comprehensive audit to remove the illegal ballots. This should absolutely occur in every single contested state before the election is certified.' Alleges 'criminal enterprise' 'So, when you hear — when you hear, “While there is no evidence to prove any wrongdoing,” this is the most fraudulent thing anybody’s — this is a criminal enterprise. This is a criminal enterprise.' Fight like hell 'And again, most people would stand there at 9 o’clock in the evening and , “I want to thank you very much,” and they go off to some other life. But I something is wrong here, something is really wrong, can’t have happened, and we fight. We fight like hell, and if you don’t fight like hell you’re not going to have a country anymore.' Advertisement As the historic mob invasion of the U.S. seat of legislative government unfolded, a variety of people with influence over Trump sought to get to him to urge action. The routes they took were typical of the loosely organized web of influence within the Trump White House. Trump ally Sen. Lindsey Graham – who only after the riot firmly declared Joe Biden the winner of the election – reached out to the president's daughter, Ivanka Trump. 'It took him a while to appreciate the gravity of the situation,' Graham told the Post. 'The president saw these people as his allies in his journey and sympathetic to the idea that the election was stolen,' Graham of the rioters who took the Capitol. House Minority Leader Rep. Kevin McCarthy, who Trump believes is so much under his wing that he has publicly called him 'My Kevin,' was pleading for action. Pro-Trump supporters storm the U.S. Capitol following a rally with President Donald Trump on January 6, 2021 in Washington, DC. Protesters attempt to enter the U.S. Capitol Building on January 06, 2021 in Washington, DC. Pro-Trump protesters entered the U.S. Capitol building after mass demonstrations in the nation's capital during a joint session Congress to ratify President-elect Joe Biden's 306-232 Electoral College win over President Donald Trump. One Capitol Police officer died in the action Police officers in riot gear line up as protesters gather on the U.S. Capitol Building on January 06, 2021 in Washington, DC. It took hours to regain control of the building McCarthy phoned Trump directly to try to plead for assistance – but also called the president's son in law, Jared Kushner, who was returning form a trip to the Middle East. Former counselor to the president Kellyanne Conway, who doesn't even work for Trump anymore, tried to get through to him to urge action. She phoned an aide she knew was in close proximity to Trump. The office of the Mayor of Washington, desperate to get more National Guard forces amid logistical and jurisdictional hurdles, also reached out to Conway. Chief of staff Mark Meadows urged Trump to speak out after an aide told him: 'They are going to kill people,' in reference to the rioters. A primary area of the pleas related to something Trump was capable of doing on his own without engaging with the bureaucracy: issuing simple Twitter or video pleas for protesters to get out of the Capitol. The appeals he finally made either lacked a direct call to fall back, or sprinkled in approving language even as the riot that would become deadly unfolded. At 2:30 pm, about half an hour after the Capitol breach, Trump told his supporters to 'Please support our Capitol Police' and to 'Stay peaceful!' His next message was more explicit, writing 'No violence!' – but claimed 'WE are the Party of Law & Order.' After he finally put out a video at about 4 pm, Trump finally told his backers to 'go home.' But he also called them 'very special,' called the election 'fraudulent,' and : 'You see the way others are treated that are so bad and so evil. I know how you feel. But go home, and go home in peace.' Trump himself had egged on his supporters with demands that they 'fight,' calling the election fraudulent, and putting pressure on Vice President Mike Pence, whose only role was ceremonial and involved opening and reading from envelopes containing electoral votes. Trump was glued to the television as the storming of the Capitol was broadcast. Prior reporting has revealed that the Washington D.C. government had requested a National Guard presence, but Guard were assigned to traffic and other assistance and weren't issued ammo or riot gear. The now resigned chief of Capitol Police he wanted more Guard support in advance of Wednesday but had been told by superiors to ask for it informally. The governor of Maryland, Larry Hogan, there were delays getting approval to send Guard forces from the Pentagon. But it wasn't mere distraction that kept Trump from springing into action. It's not atht he was too busy because he was so consumed, which he was,' the New York Times reported. 'He was pleased because it was people fighting on his behalf. He was pleased because he liked the scene. And he was pleased because it was delaying the certification of the Electoral College vote,' the New York Times reported. 'He knew what was happening... He just didn't want to do anything.' Although McCarthy told colleagues on a call Monday Trump had accepted 'some responsibility' for the riot, on Tuesday the president was back to his defiant posture familiar from impeachment and the Russia probe. Trump a second impeachment Democrats are lining up is a 'continuation of the greatest witch hunt in the history of politics.' House Democrat accuses Republican lawmakers of leading MAGA rioters on Capitol 'reconnaissance' before riot as Stop the Steal organizer revealed to have boasted of help from three GOP congressmen Rep. Mikie Sherrill Tuesday she saw lawmakers giving tours she perceived to be 'a reconnaissance to groups Tuesday, January 5 A Democratic representative revealed Tuesday she witnessed members of Congress leading 'reconnaissance' tours through the Capitol the day before the mob stormed the building – as more details emerged over the attack indicating three Republican lawmakers may have helped protesters get inside. Mikie Sherrill, who represents New Jersey's 11th district, during a Facebook Live video Tuesday night that she wants members of Congress who 'abetted' President Donald Trump and the violent crowd who descended on the Capitol to be held accountable and prevented from running for office in the future. 'We can't have a democracy if members of Congress are actively helping the president overturn the elections results,' Sherrill of her colleagues she claims assisted Trump in inciting a crowd to storm the Capitol last Wednesday, January 6. 'Not only do I intend to see that the president is removed and never runs for office again and doesn't have access to classified material,' she continued in her straight-to-camera remarks. 'I also intend to see that those members of Congress who abetted him; those members of Congress who had groups coming through the Capitol that I saw on Jan. 5 – a reconnaissance for the next day; those members of Congress that incited this violent crowd; those members of Congress that attempted to help our president undermine our democracy – I'm going to see they are held accountable, and if necessary, ensure that they don't serve in Congress.' At the same time, new revelations are surfacing that a pro-Trump activist, Ali Alexander, claimed he was assisted by three GOP representatives to help organize the January 6 assault on the Capitol to disrupt the election certification. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez in an Instagram Live video Tuesday night that she feared for her life during the riots, specifically expressing her concerns that some GOP lawmakers would give away her location to the mob. Sherrill's comments come as pro-Trump activist Ali Alexander revealed in a video on Periscope that three GOP lawmakers helped in organizing the disruption of Congress certifying the election for Joe Biden on January 6 In the video, Alexander Representatives Paul Gosar (center), Andy Biggs (left) and Mo Brooks (right) were planning something big. 'We four schemed up of putting maximum pressure on Congress while they were voting,' Alexander House Majority Whip Jim Clyburn walks past members of the National Guard Wednesday morning as they try to get some sleep inside the U.S. Capitol 'I did not know if I was going to make it to the end of that day alive, and not just in a general sense but also in a very, very specific sense,' the progressive lawmaker during the hour-long live stream. She called the close encounter 'traumatizing' and claimed her 'near assassination' is 'not an exaggeration'. 'There were QAnon and white supremacist sympathizers, and frankly white supremacist members of Congress, in that extraction point who I have felt would disclose my location and would create opportunities to allow me to be hurt, kidnapped, etc.,' Ocasio-Cortez . She did not name any of the lawmakers she felt could have jeopardized her situation. It is now known that Alexander told his followers on Periscope late last month that Republican Representatives Paul Gosar and Andy Biggs of Arizona and Representative Mo Brooks of Alabama were planning something big. Alexander helped organize one of the demonstrations that converged on the Capitol lawn Wednesday – since then, his Facebook and Twitter accounts have been locked and he is banned from the social media platforms. He in a since-deleted video: 'I want to let you guys know how we're responding because I was the person who came up with the January 6 idea with Congressman Gosar, Congressman Mo Brooks and then Congressman Andy Biggs.' All three lawmakers are hard-line Trump supporters. 'We four schemed up of putting maximum pressure on Congress while they were voting so that who we couldn't lobby, we could change the hearts and the minds of Republicans who were in that body hearing our loud roar from outside,' Alexander detailed. In the video to Periscope, he the purpose of the rally was 'to build momentum and pressure' on the day Congress moved to certify the election for Joe Biden. He also vowed that his group 'Stop the Steal' would find rooms in the nation's capital if hotels shut down in the midst of the unrest. Alexander, pictured here with conspiracy theorist Alex Jones during a demonstration in Georgia in November, helped organize the 'Stop the Steal' protesters who gathered near the Capitol before the chaos broke out last Wednesday WHO IS ALI ALEXANDER? Ali Abdul-Razaq Ali, 35, is a far-right activist who who goes by Ali Alexander. He identifies as black and Arab, according to Politico. He helped organize 'Stop the Steal' movement, which oppose Joe Biden's election win and is pushing to prove that President Donald Trump won reelection on November 3. Ali also takes responsibility for organizing the January 6 rally that convened outside the Capitol before it was stormed by thousands of pro-Trump protesters. He in a live-streamed video that GOP Representatives Paul Gosar, Andy Biggs and Mo Brooks assisted with the effort to disrupt the join session of Congress moving to certify the Electoral College results for Biden. 'I want to let you guys know how we're responding because I was the person who came up with the January 6 idea with Congressman Gosar, Congressman Mo Brooks and then Congressman Andy Biggs,' Ali in the now-deleted video. 'We four schemed up of putting maximum pressure on Congress while they were voting so that who we couldn't lobby, we could change the hearts and the minds of Republicans who were in that body hearing our loud roar from outside,' he continued. Alexander, pictured here with conspiracy theorist Alex Jones during a demonstration in Georgia in November, helped organize the 'Stop the Steal' protesters who gathered near the Capitol before the chaos broke out last Wednesday Ali Alexander pleaded guilty to two separate felony charges in 2007 and 2008 in Forth Worth Texas The activist runs with with Trump's circle. In the summer of 2019 he gathered at the White House for the president's 'social media summit' to bash platforms for their supposed anti-conservative and anti-Trump bias. This week, following reports of his involvement in the storming of the Capitol, Ali was banned from Facebook, Instagram and Twitter and his accounts were removed. Ali Abdul-Razaq Ali, 35, who goes by Ali Alexander, is a far-right activist from Fort Worth, Texas Ali raised questions during the Democratic primary race over then-candidate Kamal Harris's 'black-ness', sparking speculation he was waging a 'birther'-like campaign against her. The now vice president-elect is half Indian and half Jamaican. 'Kamala Harris is implying she is descended from American Black Slaves,' he wrote on Twitter in June 2019. 'She's not. She comes from Jamaican Slave Owners. That's fine. She's not an American Black. Period.' Trump's eldest son Donald Trump Jr. retweeted and then deleted the post, asking if it was true, and helping it go viral. Ali resides in Forth Worth, Texas. In 2007 he pleaded guilty to felony property theft in the Lone Star state and the next year also pleaded guilty to to a credit card abuse felony – also in Texas. Advertisement Alexander did not specifically call for violence and instead claimed the left is 'trying to push us to war.' Biggs' office sent out a statement claiming the congressman has not met or spoken with Alexander. Biggs' office responded to CNN, claiming he has not met or spoken with Alexander. 'Congressman Biggs is not aware of hearing of or meeting Mr. Alexander at any point -- let alone working with him to organize some part of a planned protest,' the representative's spokesperson . 'He did not have any contact with protestors or rioters, nor did he ever encourage or foster the rally or protests,' they continued. 'He was focused on his research and arguments to work within the confines of the law and established precedent to restore integrity to our elections, and to ensure that all Americans -- regardless of party affiliation -- can again have complete trust in our elections systems.' Biggs, Gosar and Brooks all came under fire after going forward with objecting to the election results even after the violent Capitol riot forced them to evacuate the chamber and delayed proceedings for hours. Sherrill, in her thirteen-and-a-half minute video posted to Facebook Tuesday, did not reveal which lawmakers she saw showing constituents around the Capitol last week – but she did make the shocking claim that the January 5 tours were part of some effort to get protesters familiar with the building before storming it the next day. While some GOP lawmakers have come under fire for inciting the riots – whether directly or indirectly – or standing idly by as they unfolded, this is the most serious charge yet against sitting members of Congress regarding the unprecedented attack last week. The six-hour riot resulted in hundreds of injuries and five deaths, including one Capitol Police officer and a female Trump supporter. The House voted Tuesday evening on a non-binding resolution calling on Vice President Mike Pence to invoke the 25th Amendment to get Trump out of office now. The vote passed 223-205, with Sherrill voting in favor of it, even though Pence notified House Speaker Nancy Pelosi earlier Tuesday that he would not comply with the measure. With the 25th Amendment off the table, and no hope of Trump resigning before his last seven days are up, House Democrats are likely to move forward Wednesday on impeaching the president for the second time. Sherrill in her video that she intends to support the effort. She also voiced the sharp divide, which is widening in Congress, claiming those who do not agree with Democratic ideals of democracy are 'now on different sides of this line.'"", ""The two top Democrats in Congress, Sen. Charles Schumer and Speaker Nancy Pelosi, reached out directly to Vice President Mike Pence Thursday to try to push him to act immediately to remove President Trump from office, only to be rebuffed. The two leaders called Pence hours after he had overseen a Joint Session of Congress to count the electoral votes to make Joe Biden the next president, despite intense pressure by President Trump that Pence move against it. Late Thursday sources told CNN that Trump's mental state was deteriorating and he was 'ranting' and 'raving' as he watched the 25th Amendment being discussed on television - with Pelosi and Schumer's demand being played repeatedly. But if they had hopes that Pence might join in a speedy potential effort to seize the reins of power from a volatile Trump in his final days in office, the reception they got may provide an answer. 'Speaker Pelosi and I tried to call the vice president this morning to tell him to do this,' Schumer told reporters in New York Thursday. 'They kept us on hold for 25 minutes and then the Vice President wouldn't come on the phone.' 'So we are making this call public because he should do it and do it right away,' Schumer , explaining why both he and Pelosi are calling on Pence and the Trump cabinet to invoke the 25th Amendment to declare Trump unfit and install Pence as president in an acting capacity. The call preceded furious comments from Pelosi charging Trump with fomenting 'insurrection' and inciting 'sedition.' 'Yesterday the President of the United States incited an armed insurrection against America,' Pelosi at a Capitol press conference a day after Trump supporters stormed the building after attending a rally where Trump spoke. She used stark language beyond even the tough talk of impeachment in last December and January, accusing him of crimes against the nation he leads. 'In calling for this seditious act, the president has committed an unspeakable assault on our nation and our people,' Pelosi. Unlike 2019 and 2020 she has just days to force through an impeachment, but this time has a far greater chance that 12 Republican senators join the Democrats to convict after some openly expressed disgust for the president or his actions. Among those Democrats would target are Pennsylvania's retiring Pat Toomey and ultra-conservative Tom Cotton, Utah's Mike Lee and Ohio's Rob Portman. In a series of developments Thursday: Just after 1pm, another bombshell dropped as Elaine Chao, the transportation secretary and wife of Mitch McConnell resigned over the violence - the first member of Trump's cabinet to quit Democratic House members circulated draft articles of impeachment accusing Trump of inciting violent sedition and being a threat to national security Facebook banned Trump from his account until at least his last day in office and possibly indefinitely Joe Biden - unprompted - raised the use of the 25th Amendment as he called the mobs 'an assault on democracy' Washington D.C, prosecutors Trump is being investigated for inciting the riots while Lindsey Graham if the president does one more thing he should be removed Former Attorney General Bill Barr 'orchestrating a mob to pressure Congress is inexcusable' White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany abruptly called a press briefing Thursday evening where she condemned violence but did not take responsibility for it House Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Thursday President Donald Trump had incited 'sedition' against the United States as she and Sen. Chuck Schumer demanded the president's removal from office Pelosi applied pressure to Vice President Mike Pence and urged him to invoke the 25th Amendment to remove Trump from office. Both Democrat leaders called Pence to demand Trump's removal from office - but were put on hold. Pence is pictured Thursday being escorted to the House Chamber 'What happened at the U.S. Capitol yesterday was an insurrection against the United States, incited by the president. This president should not hold office one day longer,' Chuck Schumer in a statement Thursday Pelosi tweeted shortly after her press conference: 'Trump is deadly to our democracy and our people. He needs to go now' Amid the focus on methods of removing the president from office, the New York Times reported that the President Trump has spoken to his advisors about the possibility of granting himself a self-pardon in the days before he leaves office. It is an untested question courts would consider a self-pardon by the president valid. Richard Nixon was pardoned by President Gerald Ford when he resigned after Watergate. Trump has told advisors since Election Day that he was thinking about the idea, even as he doled out pardons to political supporters like former national security advisor Gen. Mike Flynn, who withdrew his guilty plea to lying to the FBI in the Russia probe. Trump has tweeted that he has the power to self-pardon but has he doesn't need one. The U.S. Attorney in D.C. Thursday that the office would investigate those who instigated the rioters who stormed the Capitol, not just the vandals themselves. WHO'S QUIT TRUMP ADMINISTRATION SINCE MAGA MOBBED CAPITOL HILL? Education Secretary Betsy DeVos Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao Acting Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf Hope Hicks - who it was not related to riots Melania Trump's Chief of Staff Stephanie Grisham White House Social Secretary Rickie Niceta Deputy National Security Advisor Matt Pottinger Deputy Assistant Secretary of Commerce for Intelligence and Security John Costello Special Envoy for Northern Ireland and former OMB Director and White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney The National Security Council's Senior Director for Europe and Russia Ryan Tully Deputy Press Secretary Sarah Matthews Entire non-career staff of the Federal Aviation Administration Advertisement Trump has also considered pardons for family members Ivanka Trump, Donald Trump Jr., Eric Trump, and son-in-law Jared Kushner. He also has considered one for personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani, who addressed the rally crowd Wednesday urging 'trial by combat.' The talks came before Monday's events, and also before Trump's Jan. 2 call to Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, whom her urged to 'find' 11,780 votes that would make him the winner there, in a call leaked to the Washington Post. That call could bring legal exposure for potential violation of laws on interfering in an election. State officials have they are looking into it. Trump could only pardon himself from federal crimes. Wednesday's chaotic events are unlikely to prompt Trump to abandon thoughts of pardoning himself. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi Thursday he had incited an armed insurrection against America.' Pelosi applied pressure to Vice President Mike Pence – who presided over at joint session to count the electoral votes to make Joe Biden president in a race Trump falsely claims he won – and urged him to invoke the 25th Amendment to remove Trump from office. 'The gleeful desecration of the U.S. Capitol, which is the temple of our American democracy, and the violence targeting Congress, are horrors that will forever stain our nation's history – instigated by the president of the United States. That's why it's such a stain,' she intoned. 'By inciting sedition like he did yesterday, he must be removed from office,' she of Trump. 'While it's only 13 days left, any day can be a horror show for America,' she of Trump's remaining time in office. 'I join the Senate Democratic leader in calling on the vice president to remove this president by immediately invoking the 25th amendment. If the vice president and cabinet do not act, the Congress may be prepared to move forward with impeachment,' she . She it was an idea backed by her caucus. Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer made a similar threat in a brief statement earlier Thursday. She called Trump 'a complete tool of Putin.' 'Putin's goal was to diminish the view of democracy in the world. That's what he has been about ... the president gave him the biggest, of all of his many gifts to Putin, the biggest yesterday,' she of the Russian president. Pelosi tweeted shortly after her event: 'Trump is deadly to our democracy and our people. He needs to go now.' Schumer will become majority leader once Joe Biden is sworn in. He spoke out amid escalating concern among Trump cabinet officials, former top aides, and his recently departed attorney general Bill Barr about the president's conduct and continued risks the president could pose to the country. But there was no indication of how Republicans will act - and early in the afternoon, Elaine Chao, the Transportation Secretary and wife of Mitch McConnell quit, a move which stops her taking part in removing Trump from office. 'The quickest and most effective way - it can be done today - to remove this president from office would be for the Vice President to immediately invoke the 25th amendment,' Schumer . 'If the Vice President and the Cabinet refuse to stand up, Congress should reconvene to impeach the president,' Schumer added. His statement came shortly after Republican Rep. Adam Kinzinger of Illinois became the first elected House Republican to call for the Trump cabinet and Pence to invoke the 25th Amendment to strip away Trump's power. Republican congressman Adam Kinzinger demanded Mike Pence and the Cabinet remove Donald Trump by invoking the 25th Amendment immediately. He posted a video to Twitter in which he he is calling for Donald Trump to be removed from office 'for the sake of our Democracy' 'It's with a heavy heart I am calling for the sake of our Democracy that the 25th Amendment be invoked,' Kinzinger in a statement he posted on Twitter.' Kinzinger Trump 'invoked and inflamed passions that only gave fuel to the insurrection we saw.' His comment followed reporters that members of Trump's cabinet have been discussing use of the 25th Amendment to the constitution to declare him unfit for office Rep. David Cicilline (D-R.I.) has released articles of impeachment he has drafted with Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-Md.) and Rep. Ted Lieu (D-Calif.). The articles state that Trump 'engaged in high crimes and misdemeanors' by 'willfully inciting violence against the Government of the United States.' The articles cite Trump's Wednesday remarks to supporters shortly before they stormed the Capitol during the electoral vote count. 'Shortly before the Joint Session of Congress commenced,' Trump addressed supporters where he 'reiterated false claims that 'we won this election, and we won it by a landslide,' the articles state. Trump also 'wilfully made statements that encouraged – and foreseeably resulted in – imminent lawless action at the Capitol.' AOC Cabinet should use 25th Amendment and Congress should impeach - and wants Republican inciters expelled from House and Senate The articles a mob 'incited by President Trump' breached the Capitol and 'interfered with the Joint Session's solemn constitutional duty' to certify the results. They the actions were 'consistent with his prior efforts to subvert and obstruct' the certification of the results. They mention his Jan. 2 phone call with Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, where he asked the official to 'find' 11,780 votes that would give him victory. Georgia certified the vote for Joe Biden. Trump 'gravely endangered the security' of the U.S. and its institutions of government, the articles . IT calls his actions 'grossly incompatible with self-governance and the rule of law.' If Trump were impeached and convicted, he would be unable to hold future office of 'honor, trust or profit' under the U.S Joe Biden he would not be taking questions on whether the 25th amendment should be used to remove President Trump from office. Biden made the statement at the top of his announcement of his nominee for attorney general, explaining he wants to 'focus on the ideas today' instead. 'I know you will have a lot of questions, but I want to focus on the idea today, the judiciary as well as talking about the attorney general's office so I'll have time to answer the questions you want to ask about everything from 25th amendment but I won't speak to that today. I want this to be the issue to focus because I think it's so important,' he told the room of reporters in Wilmington, Del. Biden went on to call Wednesday's attack on the Capitol as 'one of the darkest days in the history of our nation.' He called the mob 'domestic terrorists.' 'They weren't protesters. Don't dare call them protesters. They were a riotous mob, insurrectionists. Domestic terrorists,' he . Rep. Ilhan Omar has presented article's of impeachment. 'We need to move quickly to remove this President from office,' she Rep. David Cicilline (D-R.I.) has released articles of impeachment he has drafted with Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-Md.) and Rep. Ted Lieu (D-Calif.). The articles state that Trump 'engaged in high crimes and misdemeanors' by 'willfully inciting violence against the Government of the United States' Former Attorney General Bill Barr – who departed his post before Christmas – called out Trump for 'orchestrating a mob.' Barr called it a 'betrayal of his office and supporters.' He told the Associated Press that 'orchestrating a mob to pressure Congress is inexcusable.' The talk of using the 25th Amendment comes amid fears of what damage Trump might we able to due even in the short two weeks left in his tenure as aides flee his White House and he continues to lash out at enemies – with control of the military and massive executive power. Several House Democrats have begun talk of rushing through an impeachment, after the failed January impeachment trial in the Senate. The 25th Amendment, which also governs a president who voluntarily relinquishes power on a temporary basis, requires that the vice president and 'a majority of either the principal officers of the executive departments or of such other body as Congress may by law provide' inform the Congress that the president is 'unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office.' Former Attorney General Bill Barr has 'orchestrating a mob to pressure Congress is inexcusable' Game over: Mike Pence put the final seal on Joe Biden's election victory in the early hours of Thursday morning, declaring once and for all that Donald Trump had lost the election by a 306-232 margin in the electoral college Rep. Andy Kim is seen cleaning up debris and personal belongings strewn across the floor of the Rotunda in the early morning hours of Thursday Sen. Tim Scott stops to look at damage in the early morning hours of Thursday after protesters stormed the Capitol on Wednesday WHAT DOES THE 25TH AMENDMENT ? CAN TRUMP'S CABINET REALLY TOPPLE HIM? The 25th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution deals with presidential authority in the event of death or removal from office, and was ratified in 1967, in the wake of John F Kennedy's assassination. What does the 25th Amendment ? It is in four sections, all dealing with the president leaving office during his or her elected term. The first section states that the vice president takes over the Oval Office if the president dies or resigns – or is removed – something which the original Constitution did not clearly state. Presidents of course can be removed by impeachment, a feature of the constitution from the start. They can also be removed through the 25th Amendment - of which more below. Section II states that if the vice president dies, or resigns – or is fired – both the House and Senate have to confirm a new vice president. Until 1967, presidents could change vice presidents mid-term on their own if they got the vice president to agree to resign - not something that actually happened, but which was possible in principle. Section III makes clear that a president can temporarily delegate his powers to the vice president, and later reclaim them when he - or she - is capable of serving. This is most often invoked if a president is under the influence of surgical anesthetic for a short period of time. Section IV is the amendment's most controversial part: it describes how the president can be removed from office if he is incapacitated and does not leave on his own. The vice president and 'a majority of either the principal officers of the executive departments or of such other body as Congress may by law provide' must write to both the president pro tempore of the Senate and the Speaker of the House, saying that 'the President is unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office.' The term principal officers of the executive departments would normally mean the cabinet secretaries. So at least eight of the president's 15 most senior Cabinet members together with the vice president must agree that a president should be removed before any plan can move forward. Notifying the House Speaker and the Senate president pro tempore is the act that immediately elevates the vice president to an 'acting president' role. The deposed president can contest the claim, giving the leaders of the bloodless coup four days to re-assert their claims to the House and Senate. Congress then has two days to convene – unless it is already in session – and another 21 days to vote on whether the president is incapable of serving. A two-thirds majority in both houses is required to make that determination. As soon as there is a vote with a two-thirds majority, the president loses his powers and is removed, and the vice president stops acting and is sworn in as president. But if 21 days of debate and votes ends without a two-thirds majority, the president gets back his powers. What could happen to trigger the 25th Amendment? Vice President Mike Pence and eight of the 15 'principal' Cabinet members would have to agree to notify Congress that President Donald Trump was incapable of running the country. That group is made up of the Secretary of State, Treasury Secretary, Secretary of Defense, Attorney General, Interior Secretary, Agriculture Secretary, Commerce Secretary, Labor Secretary, Health and Human Services Secretary, Transportation Secretary, Energy Secretary , Education Secretary, Veterans Affairs Secretary and Homeland Security Secretary. Their formal notification would go to the House Speaker and, in the senate, to the 'president pro tempore', the Senate's most senior member. As soon as the letter is sent, Pence would become 'acting president.' Alternatively, Congress could set up its own mechanism to decide if he is fit for office - maybe a commission, or a joint committee. Pence would still have to agree with its conclusion and then write formally to the Speaker and president pro tempore. Or another possibility is that the pool of 'principal officers' is considered to be bigger than the 15 and a majority of that group call Trump incapable. What if Trump does not agree? If Trump claims he is capable of holding office, he would write to the House Speaker and the president pro tempore of the Senate within four days, setting up three weeks of intense debate in both houses of Congress. Trump would be removed from office if both two-thirds majorities in both the House and Senate agreed with Pence and his cabal. If either of both chambers fell short of that mark, Trump would retain his powers and likely embark on a wholesale housecleaning, firing Pence and replacing disloyal Cabinet members. Are there any loopholes? The 25th Amendment allows Congress to appoint its own panel to evaluate the president instead of relying on the Cabinet – the men and women who work most closely with Trump – to decide on a course of action. It specifies that some 'other body as Congress may by law provide' could play that role, but Pence would still need to agree with any finding that the president is incapable of discharging his duties. That commission could hypothetically include anyone from presidential historians to psychiatrists, entrusted to assess the president's fitness for office. Another loophole is that it does not spell out that the Cabinet is needed to agree, but that the 'principal officers' of the departments are needed. That term is undefined in the constitution. In some departments legislation appears to name not just the secretary but deputies and even undersecretaries as 'principal officers', so many more people could be called in to the assessment of Trump's fitness. But Trump's cabinet has a swathe of 'acting' cabinet officer - and it is unclear if they could therefore take part in removing him. Could Trump fire Pence if he rebelled? No. The vice president can resign or be impeached and removed - but he does not serve at the pleasure of the president. Is there any precedent for this? No. Only Section III, the voluntary surrender of presidential powers, has ever been used - and only very briefly. In December 1978, President Jimmy Carter thought about invoking Section III when he was contemplating a surgical procedure to remove hemorrhoids. Presidents Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush both voluntarily relinquished their powers while undergoing procedures under anesthetic. Section IV has also never been invoked, although there have been claims that Ronald Reagan's chief of staff Donald Regan told his successor, Howard Baker, in 1987 that he should be prepared to invoke it because Reagan was inattentive and inept. The PBS documentary 'American Experience' recounts how Baker and his team watched Reagan closely for signs of incapacity during their first meeting and decided he was in perfect command of himself.

Several Trump cabinet members serve on an 'acting' basis and have not been confirmed by the Senate, lowering the number from the threshold of 16 department heads who would take part in a 25th Amendment scenario. A post election purge took out the Defense secretary, and Attorney General Bill Barr. Half the cabinet would have to vote, and Pence would then submit information to the Congress, making him acting president while other processes go forward. Kinzinger for years has been an outlier in the GOP conference, bashing Trump publicly and in cable TV interviews when he believes Trump runs astray of democratic norms. But his public statement, made from his Capitol office in front of a U.S. flag, illustrates how quickly the possibility of action has jumped from fantasy to reality after Wednesday's stunning events in the Capitol. The new talk of the 25th Amendment came as officials in the Trump administration continued to resign and issued statements denouncing Trump's conduct. Former White House acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney quit his diplomatic post in protest of the effort to 'overtake the government.' 'I can't do it,' Mulvaney, who called Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, another former House Republican, to convey his views. Mulvaney, a former House member from South Carolina who left Congress to join Trump's team, spoke out on CNBC hours after a pro-Trump mob stormed the Capitol after being egged on to march there by President Trump and his unsupported claims of mass election fraud. 'I called Mike Pompeo last night to let him know I was resigning from that. I can't do it. I can't stay,' he , relinquishing his post as special U.S. envoy to Northern Ireland in the final weeks of the Trump Administration. He he 'wouldn't be surprised' to see 'more of my friends resign over the next 24 to 48 hours.' Mulvaney served in the House with Pompeo. 'Those who choose to stay, and I have talked with some of them, are choosing to stay because they're worried the President might put someone worse,' he – voicing an argument made by many top Trump officials who lingered for months or years despite harboring doubts they later shared about Trump'I can't stay here. Not after yesterday,' he – with a model of Air Force One and a presidential seal in the background behind him during a video interview. Agriculture secretary Sonny Perdue he was not quitting and had not discussed the 25th Amendment with Pence or anyone else, CNN reported. But he did condemn Trump, saying: 'Inciting people to not have a peaceful transition of power was not the right thing to do.' Donald Trump - pictured at the Wednesday rally near the White House where he whipped his supporters into a frenzy by repeating his false claims of election fraud - finally accepted his fate on Thursday morning and promised an 'orderly transition' on January 20, when Joe Biden will take office after being confirmed once and for all as the election winner Trump's grudging acknowledgement that Joe Biden will take office on January 20 was posted on Twitter by White House aide Dan Scavino, after the president's own account was locked for stirring up violence on Wednesday Thousands of Donald Trump's most fervent supporters descended on Capitol Hill Wednesday to protest the results of the presidential election and obstruct Congress from certifying Joe Biden's victory Acting Department of Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf called the actions by Trump supporters who rampaged through the Capitol 'sickening' – and publicly pleaded with President Trump to condemn the violence. 'What transpired yesterday was tragic and sickening,' Wolf in a statement Thursday. 'While I have consistently condemned political violence on both sides of the aisle, specifically violence directed at law enforcement, we now see some supporters of the President using violence as a means to achieve political ends. This is unacceptable. These violent actions are unconscionable, and I implore the President and all elected officials to strongly condemn the violence that took place yesterday,' Wolf . 'DHS takes the safety and security of all Americans very seriously—it's at the core of our mission to defend our homeland. Any appearance of inciting violence by an elected official goes against who we are as Americans,' Wolf continued. He he would remain in his post 'to ensure the Department's focus remains on the serious threats facing our country and an orderly transition to President-elect Biden's DHS team.'

The VP brought the gavel down on the Trump coup at 3:41 a.m. Thursday morning and certified President-elect Joe Biden's win – despite the attempt of scores of Republicans and a violent MAGA mob to overturn it. After Pence defied his boss to settle the 2020 election once and for all, Trump finally there would be an 'orderly transition' - a hallmark of American democracy he has repeatedly called into question - but still claimed falsely that the election was stolen despite all 50 states, a series of judges and now the U.S. Congress dismissing challenges to the result. Banned from twitter, the message was sent by Dan Scavino, his golf caddy-turned social media guru. 'Even though I totally disagree with the outcome of the election, and the facts bear me out, nevertheless there will be an orderly transition on January 20,' Trump in a statement that aides posted on Twitter after the president's account was locked for stirring up violence. 'I have always we would continue our fight to ensure that only legal votes were counted,' Trump . 'While this represents the end of the greatest first term in presidential history, it's only the beginning of our fight to Make America Great Again.' Pence made the final announcement after a nearly 15-hour saga that saw rioting supporters of President Trump mob the U.S. Capitol Building in a day of carnage and shame that left four dead, saw pipe bombs, long guns and Molotov cocktails discovered in the Capitol grounds – and left America's image as the beacon of democracy reeling. The mob walked right through the halls of Congress, ransacking offices and brazenly taking photos Trump supporters attempt to ram their way through a police barricade as they raged at the president's election defeat Trump supporters marched through the Capitol Rotunda after breaching what appeared to be flimsy security - a stark contrast with the heavy-handed crackdowns that Trump ordered against Black Lives Matter protesters last summer Trash and Trump signs are seen piled beside the statue of Andrew Jackson - months after the president condemned the desecration of monuments to controversial figures in American history A protester sits in the Senate Chamber, amid an invasion that forced Congress to suspend its joint session to ratify President-elect Joe Biden's 306-232 Electoral College win over President Donald Trump The MAGA mob – which included white supremacists, Holocaust deniers and Q Anon followers - interrupted the certification of results as they smashed through police barricades, stormed into the halls of the Capitol and even sat in the Senate chamber. They looted offices, vandalized statues and confronted police as they rampaged through the Capitol, carrying Confederate flags, in hours of anarchy which shocked the world and which Biden called an 'insurrection'. As the world watched in disbelief, many were shocked at how easily the invaders had breached the hallways of American democracy - contrasting the lax security with the heavy-handed crackdowns ordered by Trump at the height of the Black Lives Matter protests last summer. Even as intruders desecrated the Capitol, Trump was to be reluctant to deploy the National Guard, with reports saying that he 'rebuffed and resisted' the request before Pence and others finally made it happen. Lawmakers were rushed off the floor of the House and Senate – and brought back at 8pm under armed guard while outside the mob defied a curfew in D.C. The president who had whipped them into fury tweeted: 'You are special. You are loved.' One woman - 14-year Air Force veteran Ashli Babbit - was shot dead inside the building, with three others dead from unspecified 'medical emergencies' during the carnage. Washington police chief Robert Contee 14 officers were injured, one of them pulled into a crowd and assaulted, while 52 people were arrested. Supporters of Donald Trump stormed the Capitol on Wednesday amid questions over how they breached security so easily A woman was shot in the chest on Wednesday afternoon after chaotic scenes broke out when dozens of Trump supporters breached security perimeters at the Capitol. She died at a hospital hours later, law enforcement sources The siege brought an hours-long halt to what is usually the solemn democratic ritual of putting a final seal on the election result. When lawmakers eventually returned to their chambers, the Republicans trying to resist Biden's victory found that their numbers had dwindled, and all of their objections were voted down. The spectacle of a violent gang rampaging through the legislature trying to overturn an election result prompted outrage and anguish from America's fellow democracies, with Britain's Boris Johnson condemning the 'disgraceful scenes' and Germany's Angela Merkel saying she was 'furious and saddened' by the chaos. It was also seized on by America's authoritarian rivals to mock the state of US democracy, with Iran calling it 'fragile and vulnerable' and Russia saying that the election system 'does not meet modern democratic standards'. Former president Barack Obama described the riot as a 'moment of great dishonor and shame for our nation', while his predecessor George W. Bush that 'this is how election results are disputed in a banana republic'. Congress' overwhelming rejection of attempts to overturn the vote and Pence's role in it will surely further enrage Trump, who wanted his VP to unilaterally overrule Biden's win - and he was left further isolated by the resignation of multiple White House aides including former press secretary Stephanie Grisham. Deputy national security adviser Matt Pottinger, social secretary Rickie Niceta and deputy press secretary Sarah Matthews also quit, with more resignations expected from aides disgusted with Trump's conduct. The president was banished from Twitter for 12 hours Wednesday due to violating the company's rules meaning he could not vent on his favorite medium. The ban was due to expire at 5am Thursday morning, but there was no immediate word on whether Trump's access had been restored. The Republican bid to overturn President-elect Joe Biden's victory ended early Thursday morning after the Senate voted 92-7 to dismiss a challenge to Pennsylvania's Electoral College vote Protesters broke windows to gain access to the Capitol as lawmakers were whisked to safety on Wednesday afternoon America's rivals gloat over Capitol chaos America's authoritarian rivals have delighted in the chaos at the Capitol, with Iran reveling in the 'fragility of Western democracy' and Venezuela mimicking the kind of criticism it usually receives from Washington. In a speech broadcast by state television, Rouhani : 'What we saw in the United States yesterday evening and today shows above all how fragile and vulnerable Western democracy is.' In China, state-run tabloid Global Times crowed that 'bubbles of democracy and freedom have burst' in America. It also compared the chaos to the Hong Kong protests in 2019, mocking US politicians who had praised the demonstrations there. In Russia, foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova the 'archaic' US system was to blame for the rampage. 'The electoral system in the United States is archaic, it does not meed modern democratic standards, creating opportunities for numerous violations, and the American media have become an instrument of political struggle,' Zakharova . And in Veneuzela, parodying the kind of statements that usually come from Washington, authorities expressed 'concern' about the violence while calling for the US follow a path of 'stability' and 'social justice'. Advertisement Although Trump still refuses to accept he lost the election, his early-morning statement was the first time he had fully acknowledged that he will be leaving the White House on January 20. The president has spent the last two months refusing to concede and lobbing baseless allegations of widespread voter fraud, even though his own Justice Department, federal courts and state governments have repeatedly the vote was carried out freely and fairly. With just 13 days left of his presidency, Trump is now at war with Mitch McConnell, facing whispers of his own cabinet trying to force him out and Democrats openly discussing impeaching him again - while just a handful of senators led by Ted Cruz and Josh Hawley and the majority of the House GOP remain loyal. It was Hawley who forced Congress to sit late into the night. Biden was at 244 of the 270 Electoral College votes needed when a final challenge of Pennsylvania's count pushed lawmakers back into their respective chambers. In the Senate, Majority Leader Mitch McConnell skipped the two hours of permitted debate and went straight to a vote. The upper chamber voted 92-7 to overrule the Republicans' objection - with some Republicans changing sides to vote with the majority after the carnage of the preceding hours. 'We don't expect additional votes tonight,' McConnell when things were done. McConnell had been against the GOP effort to challenge the Electoral College vote counts from the beginning. The House proceeded with debate and then voted 282 to 138 to overrule the challenge of Pennsylvania, with 64 Republicans voting alongside Democrats to make up the majority. Both houses have to vote in favor of a challenge for it to succeed. Republicans in the House and Senate had earlier challenged the votes in Arizona - which prompted two hours of debate, interrupted by the MAGA riot - and that objection was overwhelmingly overruled. House Republicans also tried to challenge the results in Georgia, Michigan and Nevada, but GOP senators would no longer sign on after the day's dramatic events. 'Mr. President prior to the actions and events of today we did but following the events of today it appears that some senators have withdrawn their objection,' admitted Georgia Rep. Jody Hice when challenging the results in his state.

YouTube and Facebook also followed suit in removing the posts, with Facebook and Instagram also blocking Trump from their platform for 24 hours. Snapchat blocked him on Wednesday morning, before he filmed the video. The platform their locking of his account was indefinite. In the deleted video, he poured more fuel on the fire, claiming the election was 'stolen' and telling the rioters that he 'loved' them. Twitter it had removed the tweets for violating their 'Civic Integrity policy'. 'As a result of the unprecedented and ongoing violent situation in Washington, D.C., we have required the removal of three @realDonaldTrump Tweets that were posted earlier today for repeated and severe violations of our Civic Integrity policy,' the social media company . 'This means that the account of @realDonaldTrump will be locked for 12 hours following the removal of these Tweets. If the Tweets are not removed, the account will remain locked.' Advertisement At nearly 4 a.m., Rep. Louie Gohmert tried to get one more challenge through - for the state of Wisconsin - but, again, a senator had withdrawn. That spelled the end of the MAGA campaign to upend an election and Pence went on to read out the results of the Electoral College: Biden 306, Trump 232. But he managed to avoid saying 'Joe Biden is the winner' or similar words – a minor softening of the blow to Trump by the deputy who had been until this week perhaps his most devoted follower. 'To those who wreaked havoc in our capitol today, you did not win,' Pence after lawmakers returned to their seats. 'Violence never wins. Freedom wins. And this is still the people's house.' The vice president, who chaired the special joint session as provided under the Constitution, called it a 'dark day in the history of the United States Capitol.' 'But thanks to the swift efforts of the U.S. Capitol Police, federal, state and local law enforcement, the violence was quelled. The Capitol is secured and the people's work continues,' Pence . But astonishingly – and to the disgust of Republicans including Mitt Romney and every Democrat – some Republicans continued their doomed bid to overturn the election result. The most senior was House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, who claimed that persisting was proof that Congress was not cowed by violence. And Josh Hawley, the Missouri senator who gave a clenched fist salute to the mob before it stormed the Capitol, also refused to back down even as other senators who had planned to object abandoned the campaign. 'Americans go to bed tonight their lasting memory should not be a congress overrun by rioters. It must be a resolute Congress, conducting healthy debate,' McCarthy . 'We may not disagree on a lot in America but tonight, we must show the world that we will respectfully, but thoroughly carry out the most basic duties of democracy, we will continue with the task that we have been sent here to do. 'We will follow the Constitution and the law and the process for hearing valid concerns about election integrity. We'll do it with respect.' Sen.

Hawley, who was the first senator who pledged to back a House GOP effort to object to certain states' Electoral College vote counts, refused to abandon the effort entirely. The Missouri Republican argued that the Senate floor was the appropriate place to address any election fraud concerns - as opposed to a violent riot. Pence ordered National Guard to the Capitol after Trump 'resisted' Mike Pence made the call to activate the National Guard after Trump supporters ran wild in the Capitol Building, it has been revealed. Acting Pentagon chief Christopher Miller revealed that he spoke to Pence and not Trump, the Commander in Chief, before sending in the Guard to clear out rioters. Maggie Haberman, the New York Times's White House correspondent, later revealed that Trump had 'rebuffed and resisted' attempts to call in the guard before 'White House advisers' intervened to get the move approved. Meanwhile White House National Security Advisor Robert O'Brien praised Pence's courage for certifying the state election results - a typically routine task that was thrust under the spotlight after Trump falsely suggested that Pence had the power to reject the result and declare him the victor. 'I just spoke with Vice President Pence. He is a genuinely fine and decent man. He exhibited courage today as he did at the Capitol on 9/11 as a Congressman. I am proud to serve with him,' wrote O'Brien. Advertisement 'Violence is not how you achieve change,' Hawley . 'And that's why I submit to my colleagues that what we're doing here tonight is actually very important. Because of those who have concerns about the integrity of our elections ... this is the appropriate means, this is the lawful place, where those objections and concerns should be heard.' He he hoped the Senate could address concerns 'peacefully, without violence, without attacks, without bullets.' Hawley also used the Arizona debate to complain about Pennsylvania, correctly foreseeing that there would be no full debate about that state's results. 'And so Mr. President let me just now, that briefly, in lieu of speaking about it later, a word about Pennsylvania - this is a state that I have been focused on, objected to,' Hawley . He then went on to complain that the state set-up 'universal mail-in balloting.' 'And did it irregardless of what the Pennsylvania Constitution ,' Hawley , using the improper word for regardless. The senator then objected to how the Pennsylvania Supreme Court made its decision, holding up the law that allowed for enhanced mail-in voting during the coronavirus pandemic. Directly after Hawley spoke, Sen. Mitt Romney applauded those senators, like Loeffler and Lankford, who had abandoned Hawley and the 'dirty dozen's' effort. 'The best way we can show respect to the voters who are upset is by telling them the truth,' Romney implored. And the truth, he , was 'President-Elect Biden won the election. President Trump lost.' 'I've had that experience myself, it's no fun,' Romney , a reference to losing the 2012 presidential election to Democratic President Barack Obama. As he concluded, Romney was given a standing ovation by some senators – but not by Hawley, who was sitting directly in front of him. McConnell, who earlier chastised members of his own party who planned to file objections to the Electoral College vote count, proclaimed, 'The United States Senate will not be intimidated.'

Lamb first read from the speech he had planned to give pre-riot, including that Allegheny County's vote-counting operation had '31 video cameras!' he , raising his voice. 'These objections don't deserve an ounce of respect. Not an ounce,' he then . 'A woman died out there tonight and you're making these objections,' Lamb went on. 'Let's be clear about what happened in this chamber today: invaders came in for the first time since the War of 1812.' Lamb nodded over in the direction of a group of his Republican colleagues. 'We know that that attack today, it didn't materialize out of nowhere. It was inspired by lies, the same lies you're hearing in this room tonight, and the members who are repeating those lies should be ashamed of themselves,' Lamb . 'Their constituents should be ashamed of them.' Rep. Morgan Griffith shouted to have Lamb's comments struck from the record. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi gaveled his request down, later explaining that he wasn't quick enough, saying it needed to happen 'exactly when the words are spoken.' Nearby, a scuffle among lawmakers nearly broke out involving Rep. Andy Harris, a Maryland Republican, and Rep. Colin Allred, a Texas Democrat, according to Capitol Hill reporters. Allred is a former professional football player. As 2 am neared, Rep Conor Lamb (pictured), a Pennsylvania Democrat who represents the Pittsburgh area, unloaded on the Republicans who objected to the vote from his state Speaker Nancy Pelosi reopened the House of Representatives Wednesday night with a vow to stay as long as it takes to certify the election and Joe Biden's victory.

'We always knew that this responsibility would take us into the night, and will stay as long as it takes. Our purpose will be accomplished. We must and we will show to the country.' 'We know that we're in difficult times, but little could we have imagined the assault, that was made on our democracy,' she in reference to the pro-Trump insurgents who tried to stop the Joint Session. She it was the duty of lawmakers to show the world 'the peaceful transfer of power from one president to the next.' Shortly before all House members were evacuated around 2.30pm, Capitol Police approached Pelosi, who was presiding over the chamber from the speaker's rostrum, telling her she had to leave. Pelosi didn't make a fuss and turned over her duties to House Rules Chairman Jim McGovern. He told reporters on Capitol Hill that she whispered 'thank you' and handed him the gavel as she was led away.

But he also condemned the rioters. 'We saw the worst of America this afternoon,' he . McCarthy also warned lawmakers to think twice about what they post on social media. Posts by Republicans, including President Trump, falsely stating the election was rigged and fraudulent were believed to have contributed to inciting the mob that ran sacked the Capitol. 'We also should think for a moment about what do we put on social media,' he . 'Just because you have a personal opinion different than mine, you have a right to it, but nobody has a right to become a mob. And we all should stand united to condemning them all together.' Pence's condemnation was followed by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, with Schumer - a New York Democrat - placing the blame squarely on Trump. 'Today's events would certainly not have happened without him,' Schumer . McConnell, who earlier chastised members of his own party who planned to file objections to the Electoral College vote count, proclaimed, 'The United States Senate will not be intimidated.'

And the soon-to-be majority leader, after Democrats were successful in both Georgia Senate run-off races, pointed a finger at Trump, calling the day's events the 'final terrible indelible legacy of the 45th president of the United States.' 'Undoubtedly our worst,' Schumer argued. 'Today's events did not happen spontaneously, the president who promoted conspiracy theories, who motivated these thugs, a president who exhorted them to come to our United States capitol, egged them on, who hardly ever discourages violence. This president deals a great deal of the blame,' Schumer . He that those responsible for overtaking the capitol could not be called 'protesters.' 'These were rioters and insurrectionist goons and thugs, domestic terrorists,' Schumer . 'They do not represent America Senate Majority Leader spoke immediately after Pence to declare that the chamber would not be intimidated by 'thugs.' McConnell found himself denouncing Trump's bid to overturn the election for the second time in a day, after earlier delivering a strong speech blasting the effort by members of his own caucus seeking to throw out electors in states that went for Joe Biden. Wednesday night, after Trump supporters breached hallways that McConnell has walked for decades on 'unhinged' invaders – without mentioning that it was President Trump who encouraged his supporters to march to the Capitol. Nevertheless, he eviscerated the Trump backers who ran wild inside the chamber. 'The United States Senate will not be intimidated. We will not be kept out of this chamber by thugs, mobs or threats. We will not bow to lawlessness or intimidation,' vowed McConnell. 'We are back at our post. We will discharge our duty under the Constitution and for our nation. And we're going to do it tonight,' McConnell. The Kentucky Republican proclaimed, 'Criminal behavior will never dominate the United States Congress.' Schumer followed, admitting that he didn't quite have the words to describe what happened Wednesday on Capitol Hill Sen. Lindsey Graham, one of the president's top allies in the Senate, threw water on the objectors' efforts recalling how in 1876 three southern states - South Carolina, Louisiana and Florida - sent two slates of electors to Congress, in a bid to end Reconstruction after the Civil War His words were both strengthened and undercut by his close association with Trump's tenure: McConnell's wife Elaine Chao serves as Trump's Transportation secretary. McConnell spent weeks without denouncing Trump's unsubstantiated claims the election was rigged. And it was in partnership with Trump that he achieved his life's goal of stacking the judiciary with conservative jurists. He spoke with contempt towards the mob who invaded the Capitol, saying the country had 'faced down much greater threats than the unhinged crowd we saw today.' Among Republicans bailing on the plan to contest the results was Sen. James Lankford of Oklahoma, known as an institutionalist before he signed onto the effort by Sen. Ted Cruz 'We've never been deterred before and we'll be not deterred today. They tried to disrupt our democracy. They failed,' he intoned. He called it a 'failed insurrection' and it 'only underscores how crucial the task before us is for our republic.' 'Now we're going to finish exactly what we started,' McConnell. 'We'll complete the process in the right way: by the book.' He the Senate would follow its precedents and laws and Constitution 'to the letter.' 'And we will certify the winner of the 2020 presidential election,' he forcefully. 'Criminal behavior will never dominate the United States Congress. This institution is resilient. Our democratic republic is strong. The American people deserve nothing less,' he . Among Republicans bailing on the plan to contest the results was Sen. James Lankford of Oklahoma, known as an institutionalist before he signed onto the effort by Sen. Ted Cruz. 'Why in god's name would someone think attacking law enforcement occupying United States Capitol is the best way to show that you're right? Why would you do that?' he asked. 'Rioters and thugs don't run the capitol we're the United States of America. We disagree on a lot of things and we have a lot of spirited debate in this room. But we talk it out and we honor each other. Lankford had been on the Senate floor defending the opposition to votes in states Biden won when officials evacuated the chamber and locked down the Capitol. 'I was literally interrupted mid-sentence speaking here. Because we're all aware of what was happening right outside this room,' he , praising law enforcement who protected the Capitol. Georgia Republican Sen. Kelly Loeffler, who lost her race in the early hours Wednesday to Democratic Rev. Raphael Warnock, announced that she would no longer be filing objections to Electoral College votes He quickly bowed to the new reality. 'Obviously the commission that we've asked for is not going to happen at this point and I understand that and we're headed towards tonight towards the certification of Joe Biden to be the president of the United States,' he . Cruz and his compatriots wanted a special commission to investigate electoral fraud claims tossed out of courts over a ten-day period. 'And we will work together in this body to be able to send peaceful example in the days ahead,' he concluded. Sen. Lindsey Graham, one of the president's top allies in the Senate, threw water on the objectors' efforts recalling how in 1876 three southern states - South Carolina, Louisiana and Florida - sent two slates of electors to Congress, in a bid to end Reconstruction after the Civil War. 'It led to Jim Crow,' Graham . 'If you're looking for historical guidance, this is not the one to pick.' The South Carolina Republican also that a forming a commission to look into fraud wouldn't change minds. 'Having a commission chosen by Nancy Pelosi, Mitch McConnell and John Roberts is not going to get you to where you want to go, it ain't going to work,' Graham . 'It's not going to do any good, it's going to delay and it gives credibility to a dark chapter of our history.' Graham maintained Trump was a 'consequential president.' 'But today ... all I can is count me out, enough is enough, I've tried to be helpful.' Graham praised Pence, telling him: 'what they're asking you to do, you won't do, because you can't.' Trump has pressured Pence to choose between Electoral College votes and 'alternate' slates of electors, which the vice president doesn't have the power to do. Graham also mentioned how he had traveled the world with Biden, when they served together in the Senate. 'I prayed he would lose,' Graham . 'He's the legitimate president of the United States.' Georgia Republican Sen. Kelly Loeffler, who lost her race in the early hours Wednesday to Democratic Rev. Raphael Warnock, announced that she would no longer be filing objections to Electoral College votes. 'When I arrived in Washington this morning, I fully intended to object to the certification of the electoral votes,' she . 'However, the events that have transpired today have forced me to reconsider and I cannot now, in good conscience, object.' Sen. Steve Daines, a Montana Republican, also announced that he no longer supported senators filing objections. The newly minted Sen. Roger Marshall, a Kansas Republican, who had joined Sen. Ted Cruz's 'dirty dozen,' seemed to still back the effort in his debut floor speech. 'We must restore faith and confidence in one of our republic's most hallowed and patriotic duties: voting,' Marshall . Marshall he backed the creation of an electoral commission to give states to constructive suggestions' going forward, due to the 'jarring irregularities' he claimed took place in the 2020 race. It's unclear if Marshall would back additional challenges in states going forward, as the Senate's discussion was only focused on Electoral College votes in Arizona. Police spray tear gas at a protester who picked up a police barricade in an effort to get closer to the Capitol Members of congress run for cover as protesters try to enter the House Chamber A protester walks through Congress carrying Nancy Pelosi's lectern after storming the Capitol Republican Congressman Thomas Reed announced he is against the GOP objections to the certification, earning a round of applause from Democrats. Reed walked to the Democratic side of the House to speak about his opposition, citing the day's violence in the Capitol as the reason. 'We settle our differences through elections,' he , denouncing the 'mob rule' that took place earlier in the afternoon. 'What we see tonight in this body shall be what we do in America. And that is to transfer power in a peaceful way,' he as Democrats gave him a standing ovation. Republican Congressman Matt Gaetz, a top Trump ally on Capitol Hill, pushed a conspiracy theory that some of the mob that raided the Capitol were members of Antifa, who are opposed to fascism and other forms of extreme right-wing ideology. President Trump has tried to label Antifa as a terrorist group but they a political philosophy. There is no evidence they were involved in Wednesday's insurrection. Gaetz cited the conservative newspaper The Washington Times when he spoke on the House floor to defend Republican objections to the electoral college votes in some states won by Biden. 'The Washington Times has just reported, some pretty compelling evidence from a facial recognition company, showing that some of the people who breached the Capitol today, were not Trump supporters, they were masquerading as Trump supporters, and in fact, we're members of the violet terrorist group Antifa,' he as Democrats loudly booed him. Gaetz, a frequent guest at Trump's Florida residence Mar-a-Lago, also defended the president, who was criticized by many, including members of the Republican Party, for his lackluster response to the riots. 'Another important point for the country is that this morning President Trump explicitly called for demonstrations and protests to be peaceful,' Gaetz . Trump, in tweets, did the protesters should be peaceful but he didn't call for them to stand down and leave the Capitol. Democrats booed Gaetz as he spoke, which he acknowledged: 'You can moan and groan but he was far more explicit about his calls for peace than some of the BLM and left wing writers were this summer, when we saw violence sweep across this nation.' Gaetz also got in a dig at liberal Democrats, who have called to defund the police. 'I'm sure glad that at least for one day, I didn't hear my Democratic colleagues calling to defund the police,' he as his Republican colleagues cheered. Members of Congress are pictured rushing to evacuate the House Chamber as protesters attempted to enter National Guard members line up on the Capitol grounds as protesters continue occupying the area after curfew The mostly maskless crowd flooded the halls of the Capitol with little resistance from Capitol Police The DC National Guard was deployed to the streets to help enforce a 6pm curfew Trump - after remaining silent for much of the afternoon - posted a video telling his 'very special' supporters inside the Capitol that he loves them and understands their pain but urged them 'to go home'. He had initially encouraged his supporters to march to the Capitol after a rally earlier in the afternoon before asking them only to remain peaceful when violence broke out. The Capitol was briefly secured before being placed on lockdown again at around 6.45pm due to an 'internal security threat' after an officer was reportedly found unconscious. Anyone inside a building at the Capitol complex was instructed to take cover in an office with doors locked. But just before 8pm lawmakers who had been whisked to safety when the siege kicked off began arriving back at the Capitol to resume the Joint Session to certify the Electoral College count of the presidential election. The lawmakers were seen flanked by armed guards as they made their way into the Capitol. A spokesperson for Vice President Mike Pence, who is residing over the Joint Session, he was already in the building because he'd never left. As the protesters broke down police barricades and stormed into the Capitol, lawmakers cowering inside the House Chamber were told to put on gas masks as tear gas was fired in the Rotunda. Officers at the front door of the chamber had their guns drawn at a protester trying to break down the door. The Capitol was placed on lockdown again at around 6.45pm due to an 'internal security threat' after an officers was reportedly found unconscious. Anyone inside a building at the Capitol complex was instructed to take cover in an office with doors locked For those fleeing, it was a race against time: Protesters were getting in as quickly as members of Congress could get out. One protester occupied the Senate dais and yelled: 'Trump won that election'. Some protesters even occupied Pelosi's office, sitting mockingly at a desk. The chaotic scenes unfolded soon after Trump addressed thousands of his supporters and urged them to march to the Capitol. The protesters organized via far-right social media sites, including Gab and Parler, telling each other the best routes to avoid police on their way to the Capitol. After protesters started clashing with law enforcement, Trump tweeted to his supporters to 'stay peaceful'. 'Please support our Capitol Police and Law Enforcement. They are truly on the side of our Country. Stay peaceful!' the president wrote. As the violence escalated, Trump tweeted: 'I am asking for everyone at the U.S. Capitol to remain peaceful. No violence! Remember, WE are the Party of Law & Order - respect the Law and our great men and women in Blue. Thank you!' He did not initially tell the protesters to leave. Biden on Wednesday evening called for the restoration of 'simple decency' after the mob delayed Congress from certifying the results of November's election. 'At this hour, our democracy is under unprecedented assault unlike anything we've seen in modern times,' Biden . He called it 'an assault on the rule of law like few times we have ever seen it.' 'I call on this mob to pull back and allow democracy to go forward. In an address that took less than 10 minutes and was televised against a split screen of the still-occupied Capitol building, Biden attempted to project calm and to that a deeply divided country can still come together - while also expressing outrage. He stopped short of accusing Trump of treason but the events 'bordered on sedition'. 'At their best, the words of a president can inspire,' Biden added. 'At their worst they can incite.' Minutes after Biden's address, Trump posted his own video telling his mob of supporters that he 'loves' them, but to 'go home'. In the same breath he also continued to peddle his baseless claims that the 'election was stolen'. 'There's never been a time like this where such a thing happened where they could take it away from all of us - from me, from you, from our country. This was a fraudulent election, but we can't play into the hands of these people,' he . 'We have to have peace. So, go home. We love you. You're very special. You've seen what happens. You see the way others are treated that are so bad and so evil. I know how you feel. But go home and go home in peace.' The video was later removed by Facebook, Twitter and YouTube because it violated their policies. The president then posted another tweet reiterating his false claim that the election was stolen and encouraging supporters to 'remember this day'. The tweet was perceived by some as an attempt to rile up the Capitol crowds. 'These are the things and events that happen when a sacred landslide election victory is so unceremoniously & viciously stripped away from great patriots who have been badly & unfairly treated for so long,' he tweeted. 'Go home with love & in peace. Remember this day forever!' Twitter removed the tweet for violating its rules. Mob smashes through police barriers and wall of tear gas to stop Biden's victory being certified: How Trump protesters turned Congress into a battlefield Capitol Police used tear gas as hundreds of people were seen climbing the marble steps outside the building. They banged on the locked doors of the Capitol and smashed the glass in the doors. Demonstrators fought with police and then forced their way into the building. Asked how so many people were able to get in, officials they were focusing their attention on keeping lawmakers inside safe. 'We love you. You are special.' Trump finally addresses Capitol mob HE unleashed and 'Go home now. We have to have peace' Donald Trump told his mob of supporters that he 'loves' them, but to 'go home' after they rampaged past police barriers to storm the U.S. Capitol. But despite calling for his supporters to stand down, he continued to peddle the baseless claims that the 'election was stolen' in a video posted to Twitter Wednesday afternoon. 'There's never been a time like this where such a thing happened where they could take it away from all of us - from me, from you, from our country. This was a fraudulent election, but we can't play into the hands of these people. 'We have to have peace. So, go home. We love you. You're very special. You've seen what happens. You see the way others are treated that are so bad and so evil. I know how you feel. But go home and go home in peace,' Trump . It came hours after Trump stirred them into a frenzy at his 'Stop the Steal' rally, telling them to march on the U.S. Capitol. The president still has not conceded the election and earlier Wednesday addressed a crowd at the ellipse spouting conspiracy theories that he still had a path to win - if Vice President Mike Pence did his bidding, as well as if GOP lawmakers revolted. Pence did no such thing. The chaotic scenes unfolded soon after Trump addressed thousands of protesters and urged his supporters to march to the Capitol. After protesters started clashing with law enforcement following the Capitol breach, Trump tweeted to his supporters to 'stay peaceful' Advertisement One video posted on TikTok appeared to show a group of about four officers standing by as protesters pushed past a barricade near the Capitol building. The officers did not appear to try to block the stampede, instead walking with it toward the building. One protester jumped up on the dais, where the president of the Senate presides, and yelled: 'Trump won that election.' Several dozen protesters roamed the halls of the Capitol, yelling: 'Where are they?' Tear gas was being used by Capitol Police as protesters filled both the House and Senate side of the Capitol. Another protester in the Senate yelled: 'Where's Pence, show yourself!' The chaos caused the Capitol to go on lockdown and disrupted the certification of the electoral college vote that would cement Biden's victory. Mayor Bowser declared a 6pm curfew for the city and multiple law enforcement agencies would be patrolling the streets. Just before the curfew went into effect she was asked multiple by times by CNN if curfew violators would be arrested, but she refused to give a clear answer. Bowser 'many' arrests had already been made but did not have a specific number. As footage started coming out of Capitol Hill being breached by angry Trump supporters, Donald Trump Jr tried to quell the outburst with a tweet – that was critical of Democrats and liberals. 'This is wrong and not who we are. Be peaceful and use your 1st Amendment rights, but don't start acting like the other side,' Trump Jr. wrote. 'We have a country to save and this doesn't help anyone.' Meanwhile, the president continued to direct his rage at Pence, who earlier announced he would not single-handedly overturn the election results from his position of the chair. 'Mike Pence didn't have the courage to do what should have been done to protect our Country and our Constitution, giving States a chance to certify a corrected set of facts, not the fraudulent or inaccurate ones which they were asked to previously certify. USA demands the truth!' the president tweeted. The extraordinary breech was a departure from security mishaps of the past. Protesters have routinely disrupted televised hearings while in progress and even events inside the House chamber. But trained Capitol Police are usually able to arrest disruptors and remove them immediately. Often formal charges are never filed. But in Wednesday's storming of the building, dozens of people made it by armed police officers and entered the building without going through any security set up to keep out those with weapons or dangerous items. There were occasions after September 11th when the building was placed on lockdown and people were ordered to leave, but this usually happened when suspicious packages were discovered. When the building is open, as it was before the pandemic, members of the general public are not allowed to walk unescorted on the second floor where lawmakers enter and exit the legislative chambers. The protesters were aided by scaffolding constructed for the upcoming inauguration. In another tense piece of video from inside, Rep. Michael McCaul (R-Texas) tweeted video of protesters repeatedly rushing Capitol Police officers in the crypt, in the ground floor part of the building under the rotunda. 'I like many people voted for President Trump in the 2020 election and hoped for a different result,' McCaul wrote. 'But violence and destruction is not the way to express your grievances. This is disgraceful and has to end.'

Protesters swarmed into the Kansas statehouse in Topeka and gathered inside the first floor of the Capitol Rotunda, though the rally remained orderly, television station KSNT reported. There were no immediate reports of violence, despite the flurry of demonstrations by pro-Trump demonstrators echoing his baseless claims that he was robbed of a re-election victory due to voter fraud. Denver Mayor Michael Hancock on Twitter that he had instructed city agencies to close municipal offices early in Colorado's state capital 'out of an abundance of caution' after about 700 demonstrators gathered at the statehouse downtown. 'My hope is that this situation will be resolved quickly. Pray for our nation,' he tweeted. A major courthouse complex and two other government buildings in Atlanta, the capital of Georgia, were also ordered closed due to protests near the statehouse. Among those whose daily routines were altered were aides to Georgia's secretary of state, Brad Raffensperger, the Republican election official pressured by Trump in a weekend telephone call to 'find' enough additional votes for the president to overturn the November victory of President-elect Joe Biden, due to take office in two weeks. Raffensperger's spokesman, Walter Jones, staff left their offices after lunch out of an abundance of caution because of protests. He Raffensperger was not in the office at the time. In Salt Lake City, Dana Jones, director of the state Capitol Preservation Board, she had asked building staff to work from home on Wednesday afternoon on the advice of the Utah Highway Patrol and public safety commissioner, according to the Salt Lake Tribune. The precaution was taken, the newspaper , in response to a crowd of about 250 pro-Trump demonstrators who posted signs on the Capitol building that read: 'Stop the steal!' and 'Trump won!' A Utah state police spokesman security had been beefed up at the Capitol, though he protesters there were 'very peaceful,' the Tribune reported. It one of its photographers was pepper-sprayed by individuals upset that he was documenting their protest. Several hundred Trump supporters also staged a 'Stop the Steal' rally at the Arizona state Capitol in Phoenix, cheering and jeering while exhibiting a guillotine.

He threatened Pence saying 'I'm not hearing good stories' and telling him to have 'courage' to strike down swing states' votes – a move which would defy the constitution. But minutes before arriving on Capitol Hill to preside over the joint session of Congress to certify the election's outcome, Pence bluntly told lawmakers that he would refuse to obey Trump's orders. Pence sent a letter to the 535 senators and representatives on Capitol Hill ahead of his presiding over the Joint Session that will certify Joe Biden's victory. In it, he outlined his belief in his role in the proceedings, which he notes is 'ceremonial' and adds that it doesn't include the authority to 'determine which electoral votes should be counted and which should not.' Trump has tried to put the blame on Pence for his expected loss on Wednesday but the president also lacks support among the majority of senators in his own party, which dooms his efforts for a congressional overthrow of the results. Pence acknowledged Trump's allegations the election was rigged, of which there has been no proof and no court has upheld, in a likely peace offering to the president. 'I share the concerns of millions of Americans about the integrity of this election,' he wrote. In a letter Wednesday, Pence , 'It is my considered judgment that my oath to support and defend the Constitution contains me from claiming unilateral authority to determine which electoral votes should be counted and which should not' But he noted as vice president he does not have the power from the constitution to decide which electoral votes are counted and which are not. 'As a student of history who loves the constitution and reveres its Framers, I do not believe that the Founds of our country intended to invest the vice president with unilateral authority to decide which electoral votes should be counted during the Joint Session of Congress and no Vice President in American history has ever asserted such authority,' Pence noted. He added vice presidents in the past have conducted 'the proceedings in an orderly manner even where the count resulted in the defeat of their party or their own candidacy'. 'It is my considered judgement that my oath to support and defend the Constitution constrains me from claiming unilateral authority to determine which electoral votes should be counted and which should not,' he . He concluded his letter with a prayer to God: 'When the Joint Session of Congress convenes today, I will do my duty to see to it that we open the certificates of electors of the several states, we hear objections raised by Senators and Representatives, and we count the votes of the Electoral College for President and Vice President in a manner consistent with our Constitution, laws and history. So Help Me God.' Pelosi reminded lawmakers that only 11 members from each party were allowed on the House floor at a time due to social distancing. She called out Republicans for having too many lawmakers on the floor 'The law voter registration ends on October 5. Democrats we don't care what the law they went to a court got an Obama appointed judge to extend in 18 days,' Republican Congressman Jim Jordan, a top Trump ally on Capitol Hill, complained of Arizona Speaker Nancy Pelosi presided over the debate. She sanitized the gavel before she used it. Pence had used it when he presided over the Joint Session REPUBLICANS OBJECT TO ARIZONA'S VOTES When the certification process got underway shortly after 1pm Wednesday, lawmakers got through Alabama and Alaska, two states that went for Trump, before the first objection was filed for Arizona. Rep. Paul Gosar, an Arizona Republican, objected to his state's Electoral College votes going to Biden and Harris. He confirmed that his objection had been signed on to by a US senator. Democrats in the chamber audibly groaned while droves of Republicans in the chamber stood up and clapped. The move forced Pence to order the houses out of Joint Session. The senators in the House chamber started moving back toward their side of the US Capitol. On the House side, during their debate on the Arizona objection, Republican lawmakers used their time to complain about the treatment of the president, particularly the impeachment process and special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation. They did not offer any proof of voter fraud but complained that voter laws were changed ahead of the November contest, which is not illegal. 'The law voter registration ends on October 5. Democrats we don't care what the law they went to a court got an Obama appointed judge to extend in 18 days,' Republican Congressman Jim Jordan, a top Trump ally on Capitol Hill, complained of Arizona. Many states had their voter registration deadlines extended because of the coronavirus pandemic – the extension applied to voters of both parties. Other states extended the time period allowing mail-in voting, again because of the pandemic and it applied to all voters. Democrats argued the election was legally conducted. 'Under some of the most trying circumstances in our history, our fellow citizens conducted a free and fair election vindicating our founders belief once again that we were capable of self government, and a peaceful transition of power,' Democratic Congressman Adam Schiff . Speaker Pelosi presided over the debate. She sanitized the gavel before she used it. Pence had used it when he presided over the Joint Session. Pelosi also reminded lawmakers that only 11 members from each party were allowed on the House floor at a time due to social distancing. She called out Republicans for having too many lawmakers on the floor. MITCH MCCONNELL SLAMS ELECTION 'CONSPIRACY THEORIES' Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell shamed Trump and his own Republican colleagues for mounting challenges to the Electoral College vote count, saying their doing so could lead to a 'death spiral' of American democracy – and pointing out there's no real evidence of widespread voter fraud. 'We're debating a step that has never been taken in American history, whether Congress should overrule the voters and overturn a presidential election,' he on the Senate floor, after Rep Gosar and a batch of GOP senators, including Sen Ted Cruz, objected to Arizona's Electoral College vote count. McConnell ridiculed Trump's claims of widespread voter fraud in a five-minute speech, which will be one of his last as majority leader, and which he was about the most important vote of his career. 'The assertions range from specific, local allegations to Constitutional arguments to sweeping conspiracy theories,' McConnell . He reminded senators that he was supportive of Trump using the country's legal system, which handed the president and his team loss after loss. And pointed out that these cases were heard by some of the 'all-star judges whom the president himself nominated' - including on the U.S. Supreme Court. McConnell that every election is plagued by some instances of vote irregularity. 'And of course that's unacceptable,' he . McConnell ridiculed President Donald Trump's claims of widespread voter fraud in a five-minute speech which will be one of his last as majority leader – and which he was about the most important vote of his career The top Senate Republican also he supported 'strong state-led voting reforms,' adding that he didn't wan tto see 'last year's bizarre pandemic procedures' - like mail-in ballots that gave Democrats an edge - 'become the new norm.' 'But my colleagues nothing before us proves illegality anywhere near the massive scale, the massive scale that would have tipped the entire election,' McConnell argued. 'Nor can public doubt alone justify a radical break, when the doubt itself was incited without any evidence.' He pointed out that the Constitution gives Congress a 'limited role.' 'We simply can't declare ourselves a national board of elections on steroids,' McConnell . Twisting the knife into Trump, McConnell also pointed out that the race between Biden and Trump 'was not unusually close.' 'The Electoral College margin was almost identical to what it was in 2016,' McConnell pointed out. 'If this election were overturned by mere allegations from the losing side our democracy would enter a death spiral,' McConnell warned. 'We'd never see a whole nation accept an election again.' 'Every four years there would be a scramble for power at any cost,' he added. TRUMP'S STOP THE STEAL RALLY This came after Trump excoriated 'weak' Republicans and demanded fealty from Pence to a rally crowd near the White House on Wednesday, where he demanded Pence and Congress overturn the election results that lead to his defeat. In an extraordinary speech, Trump once again called his election 'rigged' just minutes before a joint meeting of Congress was to begin counting the certified electoral votes that have him losing to Joe Biden. Trump referred to votes that came in after 10pm election night – which consisted of in-person and mail-in ballots and denied him the lead he he and his pollsters anticipated – as 'these explosions of bullsh*t.' Members of the crowd immediately chanted 'Bullshi*t!' in response. 'Our election was over at 10 in the evening,' Trump . Trump mocked his party's 2012 Republican presidential nominee, now-Sen. Mitt Romney, for conceded his own race back then. 'We will never concede. It doesn't happen,' he – although losing candidates have conceded for generations. 'There's never been anything like this. It's a pure theft.' Trump's comments amounted to a declaration of war on elements of his party, after his lawyer Rudy Giuliani demanded 'trial by combat' against opponents of his claims of election fraud. Trump spoke to a crowd of several thousand – but referred to them as consisting of 'hundreds of thousands' of supporters fathered on a lawn south of the White House that doesn't hold that many. He his election was 'stolen by the fake news media. That's what they've done and that's what they're doing.' Trump addressed his thousands of his supporters near the White House Wednesday at his 'Save America' rally and declared war on his own party, calling Republicans who opposed him 'weak' Hours after a humiliating defeat in one Georgia Senate race and the prospect of losing another, Team Trump showed no sign of conceding A stand was being erected at the base of the US Capitol as a pro-Trump supporter holds a flag, hours before Congress meets to certify the electoral college vote for Biden A crowd of Trump supporters started gathering outside of the White House for a rally on Wednesday He urged his supporters to march down to the Congress, which was to commence the count at 1 pm. 'We're going to walk down to the Capitol and we're going to cheer on our brave senators and congressmen and women,' he , speaking from behind a pane of bullet-proof material. He turned up the heat on Pence, a potential 2024 contender who will preside over the count. His role is set in the Constitution and the Electoral Count Act, and is largely ceremonial. 'Mike Pence is going to have to come through for us, and if he doesn't that will be a sad day for our country because you're sworn to uphold our Constitution,' he . Trump acknowledged that he has tried to pressure Pence into rejecting votes from states he lost, quoting from a conversation he has denied happened. 'All Vice President Pence has to do is send it back to the states to re-certify and we become president and you are the happiest people,' he told his fans, who cheered 'Stop the Steal!' at times.

Simmering tensions in the wake of the Southport stabbings have erupted into protests around the country, with mayhem breaking out in Leeds, Stoke and Liverpool, where multiple officers have been injured tackling the disorder. Unverified reports on social media suggested a man was stabbed in Hanley, Stoke-on-Trent. However, Staffordshire Police denied that an attack had taken place in the town, with no stabbings reported to cops or emergency services. Footage posted online showed groups of Muslims gathering to 'defend mosques'. Many appeared to be carrying sticks, though they they were in the city 'peacefully'. Major violence unfolded in Manchester when a massive brawl was swiftly broken up by officers wielding batons after a man allegedly threw a flare. Protesters tore down fences to hurl at other demonstrators as police put themselves between rival groups. Footage shows men clutching cups of alcohol shouting and jeering as others jumped into a jumbled fight, each side grappling one another and ripping clothing. In Nottingham, protesters waved England flags and made gestures at police while in Liverpool, activists hurled bricks and a scooter at police officers as the protests threatened to spill over into all-out violence. And in Hull, tear gas was deployed against demonstrators who smashed the windows of a hotel housing asylum seekers. Three officers were injured and four arrests were made, Humberside Police . Shocking scenes appeared to show an Asian man attacked after he reversed into a fence trying to escape the mob - while cars were torched and vandalised in an afternoon of rampant chaos. More than 35 'Enough is Enough' demonstrations are planned across the UK this weekend, with several counter-protests by groups such as Unite Against Fascism and Stand Up to Racism also set to take place. Today, 24 rallies are taking place - 22 of which are Enough is Enough protests, one an anti-racist protest and one is to be a peaceful vigil. It comes as ministers are expected to hold a group call today to discuss public order. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has pledged his 'full support' for the police to take action against 'extremists' attempting to 'sow hate' by intimidating communities as he held emergency talks with ministers over the unrest in parts of England.

The riots in cities including London and Hartlepool are thought to be triggered by misinformation spread online as to the identity of the teenager suspected of killing Bebe King, six, Elsie Dot Stancombe, seven, and Alice Dasilva Aguiar, nine. Axel Rudakubana, 17, who was born in Cardiff to Rwandan parents, was eventually named as the suspect in a bid to stop the chaos. Southport locals - including Elsie's mother - have desperately pleaded for the violence to stop to no avail. Shadow home secretary James Cleverly PM Sir Keir Starmer and the Home Secretary need to 'do more' to restore public order and 'send a clear message to the thugs'. There is a big turnout in Nottingham today, where counter-protesters seem to outnumber the Enough is Enough members. Over 400 counter-protesters also massed in Cardiff, including Black Lives Matter and Stand Up to Racism, in contrast to a small number of demonstrators. At least three people were led away in handcuffs as demonstrators faced counter-protesters in the city. Police separated the two groups in King Street as projectiles including cans, bottles, eggs and fruit were thrown, with some hitting officers. In Liverpool, photos show officers kicking a flare away after it was launched into the crowd. An officer was kicked and knocked off his motorbike this afternoon in shocking scenes as the protests escalated dramatically in the city. A chair was also thrown at an officer and hit him on the head, as bricks and bottles were also thrown. Merseyside Police multiple officers had been injured trying to police the demonstrations in the city. The force : 'A number of officers have been injured as they deal with serious disorder in Liverpool city centre. This behaviour, which puts the public and our officers in harm's way, will not be tolerated. And we will be arresting those responsible.' At 9am this morning, hundreds of counter-protesters gathered at Piccadilly Gardens in Manchester ready to face off with the Enough is Enough members. Around half an hour later, the protesters turned up dressed in balaclavas and England flags. Police separated anti-immigration protesters chanting Tommy Robinson's name from the counter-rally organised by anti-hate groups in Manchester. Shocking scenes appeared to show a black man being surrounded and beaten up after he was accosted by crowds of thugs, being kicked in the face before he was surrounded, backed against a wall and beaten. After he was dragged along the floor, police rushed the scene - as violent yobs attempted to get past them and continue to attack him, chanting 'save our kids'.

Greater Manchester Police later issued a Section 34 dispersal order for the city centre after anti-immigration protesters and counter-demonstrators had to be separated. The notice, issued under the Anti-Social Behaviour, Crime and Policing Act 2014 at 11am, gives police the right to order people to leave a specified area if they are committing or are suspected to be committing, anti-social behaviour.

Chants of 'save our kids' and 'we want Starmer out' were also heard from those gathered as the fighting broke out. Sir Keir Starmer police have the Government's 'full support' to take action against 'extremists' attacking officers and attempting to 'sow hate' as he held crisis talks with ministers over the violence across parts of England. Home Secretary Yvette Cooper she would work with forces to help ensure 'consequences, arrests and prosecutions' for those responsible. She added that communities have a 'right to feel safe,' as she insisted the police have the Government's full support to take the 'strongest possible action'. Asked what ministers could do to help counter the violence, the Home Secretary : 'The police need to lead operations in communities across the country where there has been both violent disorder and thuggery on the streets, which is completely unacceptable, completely damaging and where the police need to, they have our full support, taking the strongest possible action, making sure that these criminals face the full force of the law. 'And also already there are some of the suspects and perpetrators have already been arrested, already facing charges and are in custody, but we expect more of that to continue and we will support the police every step of the way. Communities have a right to be able to feel safe.' A Downing Street spokesperson : 'Addressing the scenes of disorder we have seen today, the Prime Minister set out that the police have our full support to take action against extremists on our streets who are attacking police officers, disrupting local businesses and attempting to sow hate by intimidating communities.'

In one clash, a man was knocked unconscious when he fell backwards and hit his head on the ground. Another man drove his motorbike at the crowd before officers arrived. Separately, police in Belfast this afternoon deployed Land Rovers to keep an 'anti-Islam' protest separated from an anti-racism counter protest. This does not seem to be affiliated with Enough is Enough. Eyewitnesses protesters chanted 'Islam out' in front of Belfast City Hall as they unfurled Union flags. The Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) they are treating reports of criminal damage as 'hate crimes', and have made two arrests. The rally was staged in response to calls on social media for 'anti-Islamic' protests.

Others came with a flag bearing the inscription: 'Stop mass immigration'. Hampshire Constabulary no incidents have been reported from the demonstration in Portsmouth this morning. A small but concentrated gathering of people assembled on the steps of the Guildhall in the city centre and were met with a handful of counter-protesters.

At 12pm, protesters also began to congregate at Victoria Square in Hull. Horrific video showed thugs rushing an Asian man in a car, as they shouted 'p***', smashing the window as clouds of black smoke billowed overhead. Just before 3pm, violence broke out after a protester threw a rock at a line of police officers. The protesters seem to be trying to get to asylum seekers in a hotel - smashing the windows - and pelted officers with abuse. The riot police began deploying tear gas in the demonstrator's faces.

Police separated groups of demonstrators outside the Cunard Building on The Strand in Liverpool. The windscreen of a police van was smashed as bricks and plastic barriers were thrown.

Shadow home secretary James Cleverly the Prime Minister and Home Secretary need to 'do more' to restore public order and 'send a clear message to the thugs'. The Tory leadership contender in a statement: 'In opposition Labour voted against public order measures we brought forward to give our police more powers to keep our streets clear, calm and safe, and Keir Starmer taking the knee sent completely the wrong message. There is never a justification for disorder like this. 'Now they are in Government Labour need to clamp down immediately on the violence that we have seen across the country and send a clear message to the thugs that they will be met with the full strength of the law. 'The public expects the Government to restore order. The Prime Minister and Home Secretary must do more to demonstrate that they are gripping this situation. 'They should be giving regular updates alongside the police so potential rioters know that they won't get away with this and they must haul the tech companies in to ensure they are doing everything they can to prevent the spread of disinformation fuelling these events.' Sunderland Central Labour MP Lewis Atkinson a link could be drawn between the disorder in his constituency on Friday and the ashes of the English Defence League (EDL), which was founded by Tommy Robinson, whose real name is Stephen Yaxley Lennon. NOTTINGHAM: protesters in the Market Square have clashed with officers MANCHESTER: This morning, hundreds of counter-protesters gathered in preparation for the Enough is Enough rallies taking place today MANCHESTER: Hundreds of protesters on both sides of railings set up to separate them can be seen in Piccadilly Gardens at 9.30 this morning MANCHESTER: Activists take part in a protest at Piccadilly Gardens, holding an England flag A police officer breaks down a door in Sunderland to make an arrest after a night of horrendous violence in the city Two people were arrested, a woman aged 43 on suspicion of violent disorder, and a man aged 55 on suspicion of provoking violence The EDL has disbanded but its supporters remain active, and Mr Atkinson evidence suggested a Nazi offshoot of the group was involved in the violence in his constituency on Friday, in which a police station was torched and a mosque attacked. Northumbria Police Chief Superintendent Mark Hall four officers were injured during the violence in the city and 10 people have been arrested. He told reporters that those involved in the disorder should 'expect to be met with the full force of the law', adding: 'This was not a protest, this was unforgivable violence and disorder.' Chairman of Mosques and Imams National Advisory Board, Qari Asim, the Muslim community is 'deeply worried and anxious about the planned protests by the far right groups across the country'. He : 'This intimidation and violence is the inevitable, devastating, outcome of rising Islamophobia that has been enabled to fester on social media, in parts of the mainstream media and by some populist leaders.' Meanwhile, Tory leadership hopeful Robert Jenrick 'elements of the far right' appear to be involved in the rioting while fellow contender Priti Patel denounced the 'thuggery' and MPs should unite in condemnation. Mr Atkinson he was 'really sad' for Sunderland after a group of 'racists' descended on the city on Friday and attacked police, setting a police station and two cars on fire and targeting a mosque. He added: 'A night of idiots will not prevent us from building.' Asked how the disorder had happened, Mr Atkinson told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that protests had been suggested by people in a number of social media groups in the wake of the Southport stabbings. He : 'The far right, for example Stephen Yaxley Lennon, picked up on those and started promoting those and encouraging known far right individuals to join.' Individuals who were involved with the EDL are 'still out there' and need to be kept under surveillance, he . Mr Jenrick 'if there is a case' for proscribing the EDL it should be 'considered', when asked by the BBC. Leadership contender and former home secretary Ms Patel demanded Parliament be recalled over the violence and criticised the Government response, saying: 'Saying the nation is 'braced for disorder' is not only breathtakingly complacent, but both troubling and inadequate. NOTTINGHAM: Police officers speak to a man as people protest this afternoon MANCHESTER: Police hold back anti-racism counter protesters at Piccadilly Gardens MANCHESTER: People in front of an anti-racism counter protest at Piccadilly Gardens LIVERPOOL: Heavy police presence as people protest, following the stabbing on Monday 'The Government is now in danger of appearing to be swept away with events rather than maintaining control of them.' Thousands of people had turned out to pay their respects to Bebe King, six, Elsie Dot Stancombe, seven, and Alice Dasilva Aguiar, nine, at a vigil in Southport on Tuesday. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer later condemned 'thugs' who had travelled to the town to cause unrest. The unrest poses the biggest challenge yet of Sir Keir's premiership, evoking the scale of public disorder last seen during the 2011 riots. There were a series of riots in August 2011 in cities and towns across England, which started in Tottenham Hale, north east London, after the killing of Mark Duggan, who was shot dead by police on August 4. Education Secretary and minister for women and equalities, and MP for Houghton and Sunderland South, Bridget Phillipson, posted on X, saying: 'The scenes in our city centre tonight are shocking. We have seen unforgivable violence and thuggery. 'The criminals involved in this appalling disorder must be identified, prosecuted and punished with the full force of the law.' Rudakubana is also charged with the attempted murders of yoga class instructor Leanne Lucas, businessman John Hayes and eight children, who cannot be named for legal reasons, and with possession of a kitchen knife with a curved blade. He was remanded to youth detention accommodation and will next appear in court in October."", ""King Charles has asked aides to update him daily on the riots hitting Britain every night, according to reports. The monarch is to be engaging 'privately' in the issues around the riots, which have been engineered by far-right thugs fuelled by misinformation about the identity of the suspect in the Southport stabbings that killed three young girls. Charles has a long history of working with all of Britain's major faiths, and marked Inter Faith Week last year with more than 30 community and religious leaders from Christian, Jewish, Muslim and other walks of life. Reports of the King's concerns about the riots were first reported by Sky News as thousands of specialist riot cops were mobilised ahead of around 100 far-right protests expected to take place across Britain tonight. Leaked messages from what appear to be far-Right Telegram channels show those involved threatening the lives of anti-racism campaigners, using sick slurs and exchanging tips on how to 'hood up' as they prepare for fresh demonstrations today. Police officers and communities are braced for more unrest today as: King Charles is to have asked aides for regular updates on the riots engulfing Britain in the wake of the Southport stabbings (file photo) The King is a steadfast supporter of interfaith dialogue (seen here during Inter Faith Week last November) Police attempt to disperse a group of residents in Walthamstow, London, after they gathered outside an immigration bureau thought to be targeted by far-right thugs Police vans line the street in Sheffield this afternoon as police prepare for more violence Locals board up windows in Walthamstow, north London, ahead of expected protests A hit-list of 39 places around England has emerged online ahead of more planned protests tonight Police van patrols outside a business listed as a site for a potential anti-immigration protest is boarded up in Westcliff, a suburb of Southend Police vehicle is seen as shops close early due to fear, safety and possible looting hours before a planned far-right protest is set to take place in northeast London A police van is parked outside a boarded up Tesco store ahead of an anti-immigration protest called by far-right activists in Birmingham Businesses are boarded up in North Finchley, North London, today ahead of planned protests Deputy prime minister Angela Rayner visited the Holiday Inn Express in Rotherham today after it was targeted by far-right thugs last week Police officers patrol outside the Merseyside Refugee Centre in Liverpool Shops with their shutters down well ahead of closing time in Aldershot, Hampshire, which saw a protest outside a hotel housing asylum seekers turn sour Following the stabbing attack in Southport that was the catalyst for the protests-turned-riots, the King and Queen led tributes to the victims. They : 'We send our most heartfelt condolences, prayers and deepest sympathies to the families and loved ones of those who have so tragically lost their lives, and to all those affected by this truly appalling attack.' The Prince and Princess of Wales also expressed their sympathy, saying: 'As parents, we cannot begin to imagine what the families, friends and loved ones of those killed and injured in Southport today are going through.' Gatherings are now anticipated in 41 of the 43 police force areas in England and Wales. A police source : 'Today is probably going to be the busiest day of the week, into the evening.' Met Deputy Assistant Commissioner Andy Valentine today urged parents to watch their children and monitor their movements over the coming days, saying that 'no one wants to be caught up in potentially violent and criminal behaviour'. The Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) Stephen Parkinson has one case of alleged terrorism is 'actively under consideration' following widespread disorder across the country. Resources are being shared around the country as forces respond to intelligence, with the Metropolitan Police understood to be sending some officers to Manchester while others in the south east are also travelling to support colleagues in north east and north west forces. According to police sources, immigration centres and lawyers' offices are anticipated to be the main focus for the gatherings but officers could also be deployed to hotels housing asylum seekers if intelligence establishes they face credible threats. The chaos which has engulfed Britain's streets since the Southport stabbings last week has brought parts of the country to a halt, with medical appointments cancelled as staff are too scared to go to work. The Met it has more than 1,300 riot cops ready to go across the capital - and has warned perpetrators they can be tracked down even when they are wearing masks. Deputy Assistant Commissioner Andy Valentine has urged parents to 'think carefully about where their children are today' after children as young as 11 were caught up in riots across the country. Meanwhile an office worker in the City of London he and his colleagues have been told to leave their office near Liverpool Street due to 'planned riots' in the area. He that employees have been advised to work from home for the remainder of the week and not to attend the London office. Broadcaster Sky and supermarket chain Tesco are also on high alert for potential riots, according to journalist Oliver Whitfield-Miocic. Sky has extra security at its West London Campus and have told staff to leave work early and avoid nearby stations. Meanwhile, Tesco is to be 'monitoring' the situation. One immigration law firm named on the hit-list was found to have boarded itself up this morning, with other businesses including pubs and hairdressers following suit as fearful communities brace themselves for a fresh wave of violence and turn to the police to protect them. It comes as the authorities warn those taking part they could face terrorism charges in relation to the thuggery which has been cheered on by some online personalities, while more than 100 people already face court dates over the riots. The Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) Stephen Parkinson has one case of alleged terrorism is 'actively under consideration' following widespread disorder across the country. He : 'No one's been charged with a terrorism offence yet. I'm aware of one case which is actively under consideration.' Mr Parkinson has warned people not to share malicious or racist communications online - even sharing or retweeting those made by others - as doing so may be construed as a criminal offence. And he has suggested the publication of a list of immigration firms in far-right groups on Telegram may be considered a terrorism offence. Mr Parkinson added: 'The fact that it's organised groups that might be motivated by ideological reasons, the fact that they're promoting potentially very serious offences - that's the sort of instance where we might want to consider terrorism charges.' Convictions are stacking up for those who were involved in some of the earlier riots, which were first sparked by misinformation spread on social media on the identity of the suspect in the Southport killings a week ago. Derek Drummond, 58, was jailed for three years at Liverpool Crown Court for his part in violence in Southport last week, while Declan Geiran and Liam James Riley were sentenced to 30 months and 20 months in prison respectively after also admitting violent disorder following riots in Liverpool city centre. Commenting on the sentences for the trio, senior district crown prosecutor Jonathan Egan : 'The three men sentenced today are the tip of the iceberg, and just the start of what will be a very painful process for many who foolishly chose to involve themselves in violent unrest. Many of those involved will be sent to prison for a long time.' Elsewhere today, Julie Sweeney, 53, was remanded in custody after appearing in court accused of sending a threatening message suggesting blowing up 'a mosque with adults inside'.

Nick Price, Director of Legal Services at the Crown Prosecution Service, : 'People thinking of disseminating or amplifying information online which is racially inflammatory should think again – online actions have real consequences. 'There is no place for trying to stir up racial hatred and violence online at any time, let alone during this disorder. We are working closely with local law enforcement agencies to identify offenders to be charged and prosecuted. 'The CPS will continue to act swiftly and robustly and ensure those responsible for such criminality are brought to justice.' Four other men are also accused of violent disorder following rioting in the Piccadilly Gardens area of the city centre on Saturday August 4. Liam Ryan, 28, cried in court as he pleaded guilty to the charge after he had travelled from West Yorkshire to take part in the violence. Shaun Holt, 42, was not required to enter a plea to the same charge following the Piccadilly Gardens disorder. Prosecutors David Green, 41, of Stalybridge, was identified in footage 'kicking a black male while he was on the floor', while Andrew Phillips, 27, of Stretford, allegedly stamped on him. Neither gave any indication of plea as they appeared at Manchester Magistrates' Court today and they were remanded in custody. In Plymouth, five people have appeared in court charged with violent disorder following a protest in the port city on Monday night which saw police officers injured and two members of the public taken to hospital. A 17-year-old boy admitted throwing a traffic cone and a rock towards a large group of protesters, Daniel McGuire, 45, pleaded guilty after 'spitting on officers and shields' despite being told to stop, and Michael Williams, 51, was seen kicking another man during the disorder. Derek Drummond has been jailed for three years after punching a police officer in the face during a riot in Southport on Tuesday Liam Riley, 40, was sentenced to 20 months in prison after he admitted violent disorder and racially aggravated behaviour, while Declan Geiran, 29, (right) received 30 months for setting fire to a police van and sending a malicious communication Daniel McGuire (pictured), 45, pleaded guilty after 'spitting on officers and shields' despite being told to stop Daniel McGuire is knocked to the ground by riot police in Pymouth. He was remanded in custody Business premises closed in Walthamstow, East London ahead of the planned demonstration later today Windows are boarded up in Northampton, ahead of an expected anti-immigration protest A large number of shopfronts in North Finchley were boarded up today amid fears of further rioting Buildings are boarded up today in the Jewellery Quarter in Birmingham amid fears of further unrest Businesses which are fearful of being caught in the firing line of the far-Right violence have taken preemptive action, with some deciding to close rather than risking becoming collateral damage. In Westcliff-on-Sea, in Southend, one immigration firm which provides assistance in immigration cases, boarded up its doors and windows in the face of a potential protest outside tonight. In Walthamstow the Nags Head pub announced it would be closed today due to the potential for unrest after the area was named on the online hit-list as a target. Hair salons and cafes in Barnsley and Brompton also joined the growing number of businesses refusing to open today. In Sunderland, Italian restaurant Sambuca : 'Although we have faith in Northumbria Police we cannot take the risk to be caught up in violent riots like the ones that happened a few days ago.' In Bristol, which is on the list of potential targets, one lawyer he had not been this fearful since the heyday of the BNP. The threat of violence has also hit sporting fixtures, with a women's county cricket match between Essex and Kent in Chelmsford tonight being postponed in light of the planned protests. In Bath today, Avon and Somerset Police put out an urgent warning to shops and pubs over intelligence about a planned violent riot at 4pm from a group travelling from Manchester by train. One venue owner : 'We are all bracing ourselves. It's pretty frightening considering what has been happening in different parts of the country recently.' The carnage that has raged over the last week has hit medical appointments in some areas, with GPs cancelling evening services in the north east because staff were 'frightened to go to work'. Paul Williams, a general practitioner based in Stockton, told the BBC that some medical workers do not feel safe in the wake of the riots. He : 'I've checked on a few friends over the past few days and they've told me there are parts of the town that they do not feel safe working in at the moment. 'It is totally devastating that some are frightened to go into work because of the fear of intimidation.' Towns and cities across England - from Aldershot to Wigan - have been named as targets for demonstrations, with organisers saying 'they won't stop coming until you tell them...' One vile message - posted to the group's 15,000 members - : 'The n*****s will try to abuse the unrest to steal. It's in their blood to do so' Another called for the death of Nick Lowles, the founder of anti-extremism charity Hope Not Hate. Mr Lowles has responded to the threats, calling the man involved 'serious and dangerous' Another told would-be rioters to wear masks, hoodies and leave their phones at home underneath a photo of a young man in a balaclava and the tagline 'white n radical' The Nags Head pub in Walthamstow announced it would be closed on Wednesday due to the potential anti-immigration protest In Sunderland one Italian restaurant revealed it would not be opening on Wednesday as a result of a planned protest as they 'cannot take the risk' of being caught up in the riots In Brompton one cafe announced it would be closed today due to an 'anti-immigration protest' A hair salon in Barnsley also joined the growing list of businesses closing due to fears of violence at the protests Some medical clinics in Middlesbrough and Hartlepool were also cancelled earlier this week in the face of riots that saw police attacked and cars set on fire, although services have since returned to normal. In Sunderland two Filipino nurses who were on their way to provide emergency cover at a hospital were targeted by far-Right thugs who threw rocks at their taxi. The Royal College of GPs (RCGP) yesterday that there had been 'horrific and unacceptable' abuse and violence towards health workers, 'especially those from ethnic minorities'. It's chairwoman Professor Kamila Hawthorne : 'We have been shocked and appalled by the civil unrest, criminality and racist attacks we have seen across the UK in recent days. 'We're particularly concerned to hear reports of GPs, members of their teams and other healthcare professionals, especially those from ethnic minorities, being targeted with abuse and violence. This is horrific and completely unacceptable. 'Healthcare professionals dedicate their lives to caring for people in need. They deserve to be able to do their jobs without fear of being attacked or abused and both staff and patients deserve to be able to travel to and from surgeries safely.' One Bristol-based lawyer claimed this morning that he hadn't been so concerned for his own safety in years. Aziz Deen told BBC Breakfast: 'I've been advised to work from home because my office is right where the protests begin, I feel threatened and I haven't felt fear like this since the BNP were in full force. A police dog bits a masked protester in Plymouth during clashes on Monday 'Solicitors, especially those focusing on asylum and immigration should not be targeted in anyway. Policy is not in their hands, policy is in the hands of politicians. 'To go after the people who represent asylum seekers and lawful migrants who come here on work sponsorship and the like, to attack them and make them feel threatened is disgraceful.' Last night police in the city met with the Bristol Muslim Strategic Leadership Group (BMSLG) to reassure the community that there will be no threat to mosques and their livelihoods by rioters. Adeela Shafi, of BMSLG, : 'People are feeling scared, intimidated, worried and are not sure where this is going.' She added: 'It's the worst it's been for a long time, because of course we've now got social media you're having messages flying around left right and centre. '[There's] a lot of uncertainty and anxiety, fretfulness about 'what should I do - should I close my business, should I keep my kids at home?' 'Trying to reassure these communities that the police and the authorities are doing their best to keep us safe and for people to be able to go about their usual business. 'At the end of the day we live in a democracy and people should be able to protest, however the disorder we've seen is the frightful thing.' The threat of violence has seen some charities close their doors in a bid to keep people safe. In the north east of England one refugee charity, which has not been named, its volunteers had been racially abused in public, while another people who used its service were 'terrified', the BBC reported. Nearly 6,000 public order officers have now been mobilised to respond to riots over, police sources have told the BBC. Pictured: Police officers clash with protesters during the Enough is Enough protest in Whitehall, London A riot police officer is injured during the clashes with far-Right protester outside the Holiday Inn Express in Rotherham It comes as the wave of anti-immigrant sentiment continues to swirl around on certain online sites, with one group chat on Telegram listing potential targets for today. Towns and cities across England - from Aldershot to Wigan - were named as places for demonstrations, with organisers saying 'they won't stop coming until you tell them...'. One message - posted to the group's 15,000 members - : 'The n*****s will try to abuse the unrest to steal. It's in their blood to do so.' Another called for the death of Nick Lowles, the founder of anti-extremism charity Hope Not Hate. The horrific call-out : 'If anyone wants to go down in a blaze of glory, take this man with you. 'Death to Nick Lowles. Any man who takes his life will be a hero to the cause.' One extremely disturbing reply read: 'How can I do it, I'm game.' Mr Lowles has responded to the threats, calling the man involved 'serious and dangerous'. And a further post told would-be rioters to wear masks, hoodies and leave their phones at home, underneath a photo of a young man in a balaclava and the tagline: 'White n radical.' The channel was set up within hours of the stabbing last week and soon amassed a huge following - but appeared to have been removed on Monday as its membership hit 15,000. WIRED reports that the creator of the channel has attempted to make others since, but they have also been expunged. Telegram told the magazine it was 'actively monitoring the situation and are removing channels and posts containing calls to violence.' The Home Office it could not comment on whether it had asked for the channel to be removed, calling discussions around the subject an 'operational issue'. An assistant chief constable has urged people to ignore a list of locations, which has been shared on social media as possible targets for gatherings, saying police will be waiting. Andy Mariner, of Essex Police, there is 'disinformation on social media' talking about activity in the county on Wednesday, adding: 'Our message is clear - ignore it.' 'If you're planning on coming here intent on disorder, we will be waiting for you, and you will be arrested,' he . 'There is information going around on the internet highlighting specific locations around the country and some of those details of locations are just plain false, including here in Essex.' Nearly 6,000 public order officers have now been mobilised to respond to riots over this week, police sources have told the BBC. Riot police officers push back anti-migration protesters outside the Holiday Inn Express Hotel which is housing asylum seekers Police officers face protesters outside the Royal Liver Building in Liverpool on August 3 during the 'Enough is Enough' demonstration Police officers face a demonstrator at the 'Enough is Enough' protest in Whitehall, London They have that the situation is 'manageable' - adding that they hope Britain is now 'through the worst' of the chaos, although they are ready if it escalates again. Violent riots have already exploded across several cities including Manchester, Liverpool, Plymouth and Birmingham following the Southport knife rampage which claimed the lives of three young girls and left many others injured. False speculation online that the teenage suspect was an asylum seeker who had arrived in the UK on a boat has fuelled the unrest which started outside a mosque in Southport and has since spread across the UK. The misinformation is believed to have originated from a Russian-linked fake news website. Misleading posts have since been shared by the likes Andrew Tate, awaiting trial for rape in Romania, and gatherings have been promoted by far-right influencers. Thugs have then taken to the streets under the guise of 'anti-immigration' protesters seeking to 'protect' children - by smashing up cars and attacking mosques. However, X, formerly Twitter, is reported to have resisted calls to take down posts that could be seen as inciting violence, according to the Financial Times. Musk took a scythe to its moderation and safety teams after buying the site, which has plummeted in value since its acquisition by the billionaire. Right-wing groups have organised dozens of protests from Liverpool to Hull and Middlesbrough to Plymouth - with many filled with anti-immigrant rhetoric. Riots have seen hotels housing migrants set on fire and police attacked with bricks or bottles. More than 400 people have now been arrested and Director of Public Prosecutions Stephen Parkinson has the thugs could face terrorism charges as the legal system mobilises to bring offenders to justice. The CPS chief hit out at those who had used the internet for the 'purposes of incitement and planning', telling the BBC: 'If you're engaged in that activity, then you can be prosecuted for the substantive offence that you have caused (due) to what you've been doing using the internet.' And in a warning to those acting outside the UK, Mr Parkinson : 'Some people are abroad. That doesn't mean they're safe. Anti-migration protesters attempt to enter the Holiday Inn Express Hotel which is housing asylum seekers on August 4 As many as 39 areas including immigration centres and lawyers' homes have made up a 'target list' created by far-Right mobs Mounted police move in as violence breaks out in Manchester on Saturday, August 3 Riot police are confronted by far-Right activists during an Enough is Enough protest in Sunderland on Friday Police officers kettle protestors during the 'Enough is Enough' demonstration on Whitehall, outside the entrance to 10 Downing Street in central London 'We have liaison prosecutors spread around the globe who've got local links with the local judiciary and law enforcement, but also the police are also stationed abroad.' In measures reminiscent of the 2011 London riots, magistrates courts are operating round the clock to process rioters and releasing mugshots of some suspects after they have been charged in an effort to name and shame them. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer - who was himself Director of Public Prosecutions between 2008 and 2013 - the criminal justice system has shown a 'robust and swift response' in the face of ongoing unrest. A supposed 'target list' of 39 areas where further riots are planned for Wednesday was yesterday leaked on social media. A police source told The Mirror it was treating the list as a 'credible threat'. 'It's being watched closely and we are ready to respond,' they . 'We have got thousands of extra officers and where there's credible, specific intelligence, officers will be put in place and will be ready to respond immediately.' They added: 'Wednesday is going to be a busy day. We are assessing what is credible and what isn't but we have a lot more resources stood-up now than we did at the weekend. 'Some is planned but also a lot is sporadic in terms of local people seeing stuff online and turning up out of the blue. It's quite a nuanced picture.' A message on encrypted platform Telegram shows that 39 towns and cities could be braced for more violence. Serious violence and rioting by far-Right protesters continues in side streets into the evening A member of the community offers snacks to police officers on the front line in Middlesbrough Residents offer food to police on the front line in Middlesbrough this evening Protesters try to cram into the migrant hotel through a damaged fire exit in Rotherham A man looks out of The Holiday Inn hotel in Rotherham as counter demonstrators stand outside with signs saying 'refugees welcome' A bin on fire outside the Holiday Inn migrant hotel in Rotherham Five of the organisations on the list told the Financial Times they were planning to shut tomorrow and urged employees to work from home. The list includes locations such as Aldershot, Canterbury, Bedford, Birmingham and Derby. The list, which was reposted on social media, came with a threatening caption above it which reads: 'THEY WON'T STOP COMING UNTIL YOU TELL THEM... 'NO MORE IMMIGRATION. 8PM. MASK UP.' It added: 'SPREAD THIS AS FAR AND WIDE AS YOU CAN.' Justice secretary Shabana Mahmood anyone wearing a mask to a riot would be prosecuted. 'It doesn't matter who you are or what you're protesting — if you turn up in a mask, with a weapon, intent on causing disorder, you will face the full force of the law,' she wrote on X. Counter-terror officers and detectives from regional crime units are also involved in targeting far-Right ringleaders of the chaos and violence which has swept Britain. Sir Keir Starmer has vowed to take 'all necessary action' to end the far-Right riots. The Prime Minister told Cabinet today that 'people across the country want their streets to be safe and to feel safe in their communities, and we will take all necessary action to bring the disorder to an end'.

Advertisement Among the stories of Brits being targeted by far-Right thugs was the owner of a Middle Eastern supermarket in Belfast, whose shop was 'singled out' by young yobs, as a boy and the shop behind him was pelted with eggs. It allegedly came after the youths tried to steal from the store but were challenged by staff, as the Police Service of Northern Ireland are investigating it as a hate crime. It came after another supermarket, owned by a Syrian man, was torched after rioters targeted it twice. Owner Ali Moustafa Wartty that police had confirmed his had been the only shop targeted, in incidents that date back to the start of the year. He told the Belfast Telegraph: 'They have been singling us out. 'Police they cannot do anything – it's very difficult for me, I have a number of businesses in Belfast and I will have to move them. 'I'm very disappointed in Belfast.' But today - in a show of hope - locals turned out to help chase off the youths and support the local store. As many as thirty stood outside the shop in a show of unity as the threat of far-Right action continued in the Northern Irish city."", ""This is the moment a far-right thug was hauled out of his home wearing his camo Crocs alongside a teenager who stood on top of a burnt out car during the Sunderland riots, as cops continue to raid the homes of yobs. Riley Adey, 19, and Reece Greenwood, 31, both from Washington, Tyne and Wear, both pleaded guilty to one count of violent disorder following the chaos last week. Adey - who was seen teary-eyed in his mugshot - was caught after he was filmed standing on top of an upturned car after it was torched during the disorder. Footage released by Northumbria Police shows Adey being led away in handcuffs from his run-down home in Heworth Crescent. Another clip shows Greenwood, wearing a pair of camo Crocs and shorts, being bundled into a police car at his home in The Gardens. It comes as police have launched dawn raids targeting 'seriously violent' thugs who took part in riots as the crackdown on the far-right begins following last night's foiled chaos. Northumbria Police have arrested 18 people so far in connection with a far-right riot which caused thousands of pounds worth of damage to Sunderland city centre last Friday. Detective Chief Inspector Graeme Barr, of the force's Major Investigation Team (MIT), : 'We will not let up in tracking down those responsible for the unrest last weekend.

'It just goes to show that the thugs who were involved in the violent displays do not represent the communities we serve.' Police have also vowed to go after those sharing hate and inciting unrest online as: Sir Mark Rowley today that his force had smashed its way into the homes of the 'most violent' members of last weeks protests in Whitehall and branded them 'criminal thugs'. A total of 10 people were arrested, with the chief of the Metropolitan Police joining officers in south London as they took the suspects into custody. The head of Britain's largest police force it was 'nonsense' these people are patriots and hailed a 'show of unity from communities' which saw thousands of anti-racism demonstrators flood streets around the country to stop planned gatherings of the far-right. It was reported around 100 hate-filled protests had been planned across England outside immigration centres, organised on secretive far-right channels on social media app Telegram. However, come 8pm many of those did not even turn up and those that did were dwarfed in size by counter-demonstrations, with up to 25,000 anti-racist activists turning out in force in cities across the UK. This morning police went on the front foot, launching dawn raids to take those who were involved in the riots of the last week into custody, but there are warnings that the unrest might not be over with one minister suggesting more far-right protests could be planned for the coming days.

He told BBC Breakfast: 'These are criminals, they're thugs, they're no patriots. 'We've been out doing some dawn raids this morning, the people who were most violent in the Whitehall protest and violence last week. 'Yesterday and today it's going to be more than 20 people, about 70 per cent of them have got criminal backgrounds - we've got criminal damage, violence, weapons offences, football banning orders - these are criminal thugs. 'Any suggestion they're patriots or they've got a cause that they're protesting about is nonsense.' The Met chief the potential riots had 'abated' after a 'show of force' from police across the country and praised communities for rallying together. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: 'I'm really pleased with how it went. We put thousands of officers on the streets and I think the show of force from the police and frankly, the show of unity from communities together defeated the challenges that we've seen. 'It went off very peacefully last night. [There were] a couple of locations where some local criminals turned out and tried to create a bit of anti-social behaviour and we arrested a few of them, but it was a very successful night and the fears of some sort of extreme-right disorder were abated.' Since the violence began more than 400 people have been arrested and over 100 charged, with the first prison sentences handed out this week. Home Office minister Dame Diana Johnson there will be more arrests today and warned that the law will 'come for' those involved in inciting the riots online. She told the BBC: 'Over 400 people have been arrested - I'm hoping and I know that number will increase today. 'We've got over 140 people charged, that number will go up as well, and we will start to see again today, more people going into court and receiving sentences. 'And very importantly as well, I just want to make this point, it's not just those physical acts on the street that we're going to make sure people are brought to account for, but it's also what's happening online and that's really important. 'This week, we saw the first person being charged and convicted of what he'd done online, inciting violence, racial violence, and that is important. 'If you do stuff online we will come for you, just as much as we will come for you for what you do on the streets of our country if you're carrying out criminal disorder and violence.' However, she added that intelligence has suggested more riots could take place in the next few days and she was 'cautious' about declaring victory.

'There is now further intelligence of events during the next few days, and we need to see what happens there.' There are reports that up to 11 more far-right gatherings could take place across Britain in the coming days, with organisers giving out instructions in secret Facebook groups so the plans can't be leaked. Protests are being planned in Ballymena, Newcastle, Liverpool, Shrewsbury, Salford, Taunton, Birmingham, Dover, Bournemouth and Glasgow, The Sun reports. The first of these would take place on Friday in Ballymena, with most others taking place over the next two Saturdays to coincide with the start of the football season. Dal Babu, a former chief superintendent in the Met, told the same show that those involved in the violence 'are not the sharpest tools in the box'. 'We've seen people getting three years [in prison], I think that sent a very strong message,' he . 'I think some of these rioters are not the sharpest tools in the box, they've turned up with their mask on but they've got tattoos that are quite distinctive that will be on police records, so people are being identified. 'As Sir Mark Rowley , there are going to be a few doors being kicked in, a few collars felt this morning. It sends out a very strong message that if you come out rioting you're likely to get arrested.' Counter-protesters turned out in their thousands in several UK cities last night - outnumbering 'anti-immigration' protesters when they bothered to turn up. The anti-racism campaigners, which included two self-described 'Nans Against Nazis' at one counter-protest in Liverpool, arrived to deliver a clear message that Britain does not welcome hate. A huge crowd of anti-racism protesters in Walthamstow last night- far outnumbering the hateful thugs who planned to protest outside an immigration centre A man is arrested by police during an anti-immigration demonstration in Newcastle last night An anti-immigration protester speaks to police officers in North Finchley, London as a large counter-protest assembles A large gathering of anti-racist protesters outside St Anne's Centre in Toxteth, Liverpool Anti-racist campaigners turn out in Birmingham to see off a rumoured far-right gathering Counter-protesters turned out in their thousands in several UK cities last night - outnumbering 'anti-immigration' protesters when they bothered to turn up - in order to send the clear message that Britain does not welcome hate. Undeterred, red-faced would-be protesters have taken to social media to row back on their claims - and now claim there was never a plan to target refugee centres in order to waste police time. But the Telegram group responsible for sharing an alleged hit list of refugee centres for thugs to target was taken down by the typically immovable team behind the encrypted messaging app - who it breached their rules on inciting violence. The demos came as scores of arrests and dozens of convictions were sealed in rapid time, following more than a week of unrest after three young girls were killed at a Taylor Swift-themed dance class in Southport on July 29. Several rallies of hundreds-strong anti-racist activists assembled across London. More than 5,000 demonstrators gathered in Walthamstow to see off far-right rioters - but were told to disperse by police who told them: 'There's no one else here, it's just you guys'. Local restaurant owner Mohammed Lall closed up early, telling a reporter: 'Us being a Muslim business - that is a risk for us.' Hundreds gathered in North Finchley after an office in the area was reportedly targeted by far-right thugs - some of whom remonstrated with police. One protester could be heard on video yelling at an anti-racist activist: 'No-one wants you here, you c***.' He was later led away by police officers. In Brentford, anti-racist campaigners were preparing to leave shortly after 8.30pm. A reporter a small group of around 20 people in black masks and hoods were spotted around 200 metres from the hundred-strong counter-demo. Ten people were arrested in Croydon in an incident the Met was unrelated to the protest actions across the country. Four people were also arrested in Walthamstow: two for carrying weapons, namely a lock knife and a golf club, one for being drunk and disorderly and one for obstructing a stop and search under Section 60 powers. One person was also arrested for possession of an offensive weapon in Hounslow, where locals had gathered to protect a mosque. Bottles were thrown at police and objects dragged into the road after around 50 people gathered in the south London borough - but officers it was 'pure anti-social behaviour' not linked to the protests. Smaller groups of anti-racism protesters were gathered in backstreets in Sheffield, away from the main counter-demo. One woman, whose face was obscured, : 'We've done a good job of scaring them away.' In Accrington, pubgoers were seen embracing a group of Muslims walking past shortly before dusk fell. But the tension soon mounted as protesters holding 'Stand Up To Racism' placards faced off with a group chanting 'stop the boats'. Dozens of police rushed in to stop them getting close as they marched towards each other. And around 200 counter-protesters gathered outside an immigration lawyer's office in Oldham as far-right agitators failed to turn up. Four police riot vans guarded the area on the outskirts of the Greater Manchester town ahead of the proposed 8pm far-right protests. Taxi driver Ali Shah, 43, : 'It doesn't look like the far right are going to show. Maybe they've been put off by how many people are here.' A counter-protester holds a sign that reads: 'When hate is loud, love must be louder' during a protest in Brentford, west London A man described by witnesses as a far-right protester is arrested by police in Southampton as members of a counter-demo look on Police detain a man who was allegedly blocking a motorway in Portsmouth as part of an anti-immigration protest A man wearing a hoodie with his face partially covered carries a traffic cone onto Portsmouth's M275 motorway A man in a Union flag face mask attends a demonstration in Aldershot, Hampshire A man shakes hands with counter-protesters in Liverpool after reportedly telling them he could understand tensions on both sides A man waves a 'no littering' sign with a swastika being deposited in the bin in Brentford A man in Southend holds a sign reading 'Southend stands against white supremacists' during a counter-protest A huge gathering of anti-racism protesters outside the Merseyside Refugee Centre in Liverpool In Southampton, hundreds of anti-racist campaigners were separated from around 50 anti-immigration protesters by police. One protester with an England flag tied around his shoulders tried to run at the counter-group from a side road - before being restrained by police, witnesses . Speaking afterwards, Glyn Oliver, 70, he was greatly encouraged by the turn out, adding: 'I'm seeing people I don't know and loads of youngsters. It's their future and they're saying no to racism, it's great to pass the baton.' Steve Squibbs, of Stand Up to Racism, of the far-right gathering: 'Look at their turnout - it's pathetic. We are the anti-racist majority.' Anti-immigration protesters blocked off a dual carriageway into Portsmouth in scenes akin to a Just Stop Oil protest. Protestors were heard shouting 'no more immigrants', 'save our kids' and racist slurs while riot squad police officers were deployed to the scene to remove a group from the middle of the road. One of those arrested, seemingly for blocking the road, was a 17-year-old boy, friends told a reporter at the scene. Police lead a man clutching an open can of beer away from anti-racism protesters in Liverpool Protesters in the London borough of Harrow wave a banner reading 'racists out, refugees in' Counter-protesters in Walthamstow - some of whom appear to be wearing stab vests Police stand guard as an anti-racism demonstration gathers behind them in Sheffield Police remonstrate with a masked protester refusing to remove their facemask outside a refugee centre in Liverpool Hundreds of anti-racist protesters, some waving banners reading 'refugees welcome here', turned out in Southampton Anti-racism protesters outside the Refugee and Migrant Centre offices in Birmingham A hit-list of 39 places around England has emerged online ahead of more planned protests tonight Outside the Asylum Link centre on Overbury Street in Liverpool, supporters of the charity filled the road following reports a protest was due to be held outside. A police van blocked off the road as hundreds turned out to protect the building, which had boards over the windows. Signs placed on the fence around the building 'Love not hate' and 'One human family'. Dozens of protesters holding 'Stand Up To Racism' posters gathered outside Aldershot Enterprise Centre in Hampshire - as a smaller group, some of whom were masked, shouted back angrily at them. Police officers rushed in to separate the groups after tempers flared, as one side's chants of 'refugees are welcome here' were met with counter-calls of 'stop the boats'. The anti-racism campaigners were then escorted to the train station by police as anti-immigration protesters shouted at them. There were no clashes between the groups, reports suggest. Shops in Manchester's Northern Quarter were boarded up amid fears of a repeat of the violent scenes seen on Saturday - while in Newcastle police deployed from Wales were seen letting a child try on a riot helmet as they sought to keep tensions at bay. Three arrests were later made in Newcastle - though Northumbria Police the evening had 'largely passed without incident'. In Middlesbrough, locals expected the worst after violence on Sunday. Shop owner Aran, sitting with his friends drinking tea outside a Turkish barbers, : 'The community has come out tonight to protect our properties and our families, although we hope that won't be necessary.' Hundreds of people gathered in central Brighton with loud drums and music playing, and signs proclaiming 'No to Racism' and 'Education is key - misinformation kills'. A wall of police was seen shielding just a handful of men – one of whom was draped in a Union Jack – from a crowd of protesters shouting: 'Nazi scum, off our streets.' No arrests were made. And in Birmingham, hundreds of anti-racist activists assembled outside an immigration advice centre in the Jewellery Quarter, with banners calling out far-right figures that read 'Bigots out of Brum'. No arrests were made here. As a nearby clocktower sounded the hour at 8pm, there was no sign of any far-right protest. West Midlands Police later arrested a 49-year-old man following social media rumours about protests in Bordesley Green in Birmingham on Monday night that saw hundreds of Muslims turn out to see off a rumoured far-right rally. The man was arrested on suspicion of inciting racial hatred and possession of a firearm and remains in custody. His detention came after posts on social media allegedly showing images of a firearm. Police restrain a protester in a mask in Finchley, London, during a counter-demonstration A man in a skull mask is searched by police in Walthamstow, east London ahead of protests Police move through the streets in Aldershot, Hampshire, where an anti-immigration demo and a counter protest had to be kept separate by officers Anti-racism protesters, some wearing masks, gather in Preston as police officers look on Meanwhile in Bristol, the streets were filled with a reported 2,000 anti-racism protesters who were ready for a showdown with protesters planning on targeting an immigration centre. Gya Williams Immigration prepared for the threat of violence by removing all of its office signage. One local man who didn't want to be named : 'Look at the numbers man, the (far-right) brigade would be mad to go down there.' A local restaurateur who gave his name as Farooq added: 'To see this turnout of at least 2,000 people - it is heartwarming. It is uplifting It makes you so proud to be Bristolian.' Police did, however, make one arrest after a brick was thrown at a police vehicle. Avon and Somerset Police : 'We've facilitated a largely peaceful protest but we won't tolerate acts of criminality.' In Northampton, police arrested three people for public order offences. Around 150 counter-protesters turned out to see off anti-immigration activists - none of whom turned up. The no-showing hate mob prompted Northamptonshire Police to take to social media to ask the counter-rally to go home. 'Police are now asking the crowd of counter-protesters to disperse peacefully for the evening.' And a man was arrested near to the site of a planned protest in Blackpool, a crowd of passers-by jeering him as he was led to a van. Police had expected the worst tonight with thousands of cops deployed in the biggest distribution of officers since the 2011 riots. Gatherings were anticipated in 41 of the 43 police force areas in England and Wales. A police source earlier: 'Today is probably going to be the busiest day of the week, into the evening.' The chairman of the National Police Chiefs' Council had warned rioters ahead of the 'protests that never were' they were taking a 'hard line' on yobs with more than 400 already arrested. Chief Constable Gavin Stephens some are 'facing years behind bars' and that even those with no prior convictions 'will be remanded into custody' after arrest. He warned: 'You won't be going home to see your family and friends. If you carry out this thuggish behaviour, then you need to know the personal consequences that come with it and that will directly affect you.' The Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) Stephen Parkinson has one case of alleged terrorism is 'actively under consideration' following the mayhem of recent days while the King is reported to have asked aides for frequent updates. And the government is to be looking at looking at ways of banning far-right rioters from football matches amid claims that those causing chaos on the streets have links to organised football hooligan groups. The chaos which has engulfed Britain's streets since the Southport stabbings last week has brought parts of the country to a halt, with medical appointments cancelled as staff are too scared to go to work. Deputy Assistant Commissioner Andy Valentine has urged parents to 'think carefully about where their children are today' after children as young as 11 were caught up in riots across the country. Deputy prime minister Angela Rayner visited the Holiday Inn Express in Rotherham today after it was targeted by far-right thugs last week Businesses closed in North Finchley, London, ahead of anticipated far-right demonstrations Police van patrols outside a business listed as a site for a potential anti-immigration protest is boarded up in Westcliff, a suburb of Southend Shops with their shutters down well ahead of closing time in Aldershot, Hampshire, which saw a protest outside a hotel housing asylum seekers turn sour Police officers chat to two women in the centre of Sheffield this afternoon Police are gathering around the country to prepare for feared disorder Officers in riot gear will be on patrol in the city tonight amid fears of further riots Police pass by a war memorial in the centre of Sheffield this afternoon Police patrol the area around the Merseyside Refugee Support Network building A charity shop in Westcliff-on-Sea, Essex, is boarded up today ahead of potential unrest later Shops in Bristol board up their windows today amid fears over planned demonstrations An Asian cafe and store is boarded up in Westcliff-on-Sea today ahead of possible unrest Shops in Bristol board up their windows today amid fears over planned demonstrations One solicitors in Westcliff-on-Sea in Southend boarded up its doors and windows overnight after being included on a far-Right online hit-list A far-Right demonstration has been planned to take place outside the firm in Westcliff-on-Sea tonight Police officers patrol outside the Merseyside Refugee Centre in Liverpool, which has boarded up its windows An estate agent in North Finchley was also boarded up today before a possible demonstration tonight A masked rioter runs in front of a bonfire in the middle of the road in Rotherham on Sunday Meanwhile an office worker in the City of London he and his colleagues have been told to leave their office near Liverpool Street due to 'planned riots' in the area. He that employees have been advised to work from home for the remainder of the week and not to attend the London office. Broadcaster Sky and supermarket chain Tesco are also on high alert for potential riots, according to journalist Oliver Whitfield-Miocic. Sky has extra security at its West London Campus and have told staff to leave work early and avoid nearby stations. Meanwhile, Tesco is to be 'monitoring' the situation. One immigration law firm named on the hit-list was found to have boarded itself up this morning, with other businesses including pubs and hairdressers following suit as fearful communities brace themselves for a fresh wave of violence and turn to the police to protect them. However, some areas of the country remain open for business as police rumours they were set to be targeted by rioters were 'misinformation'. Lewisham police earlier today 'shops and businesses...remain open as usual and that there was spreading of misinformation online', while Hackney council it had 'no intelligence' to suggest disruption in Stoke Newington despite rumours to the contrary. It comes as the authorities warn those taking part they could face terrorism charges in relation to the thuggery which has been cheered on by some online personalities, while more than 100 people already face court dates over the riots. Merseyside Police has tonight issued images of 14 people as it investigates disorder in Southport on the day after the stabbings and in Liverpool and Walton last Saturday, which saw a library torched by thugs. The Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) Stephen Parkinson has one case of alleged terrorism is 'actively under consideration' following widespread disorder across the country. He : 'No one's been charged with a terrorism offence yet. I'm aware of one case which is actively under consideration.' Mr Parkinson has warned people not to share malicious or racist communications online - even sharing or retweeting those made by others - as doing so may be construed as a criminal offence. And he has suggested the publication of a list of immigration firms in far-right groups on Telegram may be considered a terrorism offence. Mr Parkinson added: 'The fact that it's organised groups that might be motivated by ideological reasons, the fact that they're promoting potentially very serious offences - that's the sort of instance where we might want to consider terrorism charges.' Convictions are stacking up for those who were involved in some of the earlier riots, which were first sparked by misinformation spread on social media on the identity of the suspect in the Southport killings a week ago. Cole Stewart, 18, was caught on CCTV 'celebrating' as he hurled bricks at officers in Darlington on Monday August 5 - and has been remanded in custody awaiting sentencing after pleading guilty to violent disorder. As he was arrested the teenager yelled: 'I am a child! I am a child!' Derek Drummond, 58, was jailed for three years at Liverpool Crown Court for his part in violence in Southport last week, while Declan Geiran and Liam James Riley were sentenced to 30 months and 20 months in prison respectively after also admitting violent disorder following riots in Liverpool city centre. Commenting on the sentences for the trio, senior district crown prosecutor Jonathan Egan : 'The three men sentenced today are the tip of the iceberg, and just the start of what will be a very painful process for many who foolishly chose to involve themselves in violent unrest. Many of those involved will be sent to prison for a long time.' Elsewhere today, Julie Sweeney, 53, was remanded in custody after appearing in court accused of sending a threatening message suggesting blowing up 'a mosque with adults inside'. Cole Stewart, 18, pleaded guilty to violent disorder after hurling bricks at police in Darlington Derek Drummond has been jailed for three years after punching a police officer in the face during a riot in Southport on Tuesday Liam Riley, 40, was sentenced to 20 months in prison after he admitted violent disorder and racially aggravated behaviour, while Declan Geiran, 29, (right) received 30 months for setting fire to a police van and sending a malicious communication Daniel McGuire (pictured), 45, pleaded guilty after 'spitting on officers and shields' despite being told to stop Daniel McGuire is knocked to the ground by riot police in Pymouth. He was remanded in custody Business premises closed in Walthamstow, East London ahead of the planned demonstration later today Windows are boarded up in Northampton, ahead of an expected anti-immigration protest A large number of shopfronts in North Finchley were boarded up today amid fears of further rioting Buildings are boarded up today in the Jewellery Quarter in Birmingham amid fears of further unrest Aaron Johnson admitted using racist language on a live stream he broadcast to 'millions of people' from outside a hotel in Stockport thought to contain asylum seekers at Manchester Magistrates' Court. Johnson was remanded into custody and will be sentenced at Minshull Street Crown Court on August 21. Nick Price, Director of Legal Services at the Crown Prosecution Service, : 'People thinking of disseminating or amplifying information online which is racially inflammatory should think again – online actions have real consequences. 'There is no place for trying to stir up racial hatred and violence online at any time, let alone during this disorder. We are working closely with local law enforcement agencies to identify offenders to be charged and prosecuted. 'The CPS will continue to act swiftly and robustly and ensure those responsible for such criminality are brought to justice.' Four other men are also accused of violent disorder following rioting in the Piccadilly Gardens area of the city centre on Saturday August 4. Liam Ryan, 28, cried in court as he pleaded guilty to the charge after he had travelled from West Yorkshire to take part in the violence. Shaun Holt, 42, was not required to enter a plea to the same charge following the Piccadilly Gardens disorder. Prosecutors David Green, 41, of Stalybridge, was identified in footage 'kicking a black male while he was on the floor', while Andrew Phillips, 27, of Stretford, allegedly stamped on him. Neither gave any indication of plea as they appeared at Manchester Magistrates' Court today and they were remanded in custody. In Plymouth, five people have appeared in court charged with violent disorder following a protest in the port city on Monday night which saw police officers injured and two members of the public taken to hospital. A 17-year-old boy admitted throwing a traffic cone and a rock towards a large group of protesters, Daniel McGuire, 45, pleaded guilty after 'spitting on officers and shields' despite being told to stop, and Michael Williams, 51, was seen kicking another man during the disorder. Towns and cities across England - from Aldershot to Wigan - have been named as targets for demonstrations, with organisers saying 'they won't stop coming until you tell them...' One vile message - posted to the group's 15,000 members - : 'The n*****s will try to abuse the unrest to steal. It's in their blood to do so' Another called for the death of Nick Lowles, the founder of anti-extremism charity Hope Not Hate. Mr Lowles has responded to the threats, calling the man involved 'serious and dangerous' Another told would-be rioters to wear masks, hoodies and leave their phones at home underneath a photo of a young man in a balaclava and the tagline 'white n radical' The Nags Head pub in Walthamstow announced it would be closed on Wednesday due to the potential anti-immigration protest In Sunderland one Italian restaurant revealed it would not be opening on Wednesday as a result of a planned protest as they 'cannot take the risk' of being caught up in the riots In Brompton one cafe announced it would be closed today due to an 'anti-immigration protest' A hair salon in Barnsley also joined the growing list of businesses closing due to fears of violence at the protests Businesses which are fearful of being caught in the firing line of the far-Right violence have taken preemptive action, with some deciding to close rather than risking becoming collateral damage. In Westcliff-on-Sea, in Southend, one immigration firm which provides assistance in immigration cases, boarded up its doors and windows in the face of a potential protest outside tonight. In Walthamstow the Nags Head pub announced it would be closed today due to the potential for unrest after the area was named on the online hit-list as a target. Hair salons and cafes in Barnsley and Brompton also joined the growing number of businesses refusing to open today. Sheffield United Football Club also announced that the area around its ground would be shut. In Sunderland, Italian restaurant Sambuca : 'Although we have faith in Northumbria Police we cannot take the risk to be caught up in violent riots like the ones that happened a few days ago.' In Bristol, which is on the list of potential targets, one lawyer he had not been this fearful since the heyday of the BNP. The threat of violence has also hit sporting fixtures, with a women's county cricket match between Essex and Kent in Chelmsford tonight being postponed in light of the planned protests. In Bath today, Avon and Somerset Police put out an urgent warning to shops and pubs over intelligence about a planned violent riot at 4pm from a group travelling from Manchester by train. One venue owner : 'We are all bracing ourselves. It's pretty frightening considering what has been happening in different parts of the country recently.' The carnage that has raged over the last week has hit medical appointments in some areas, with GPs cancelling evening services in the north east because staff were 'frightened to go to work'. Paul Williams, a general practitioner based in Stockton, told the BBC that some medical workers do not feel safe in the wake of the riots. He : 'I've checked on a few friends over the past few days and they've told me there are parts of the town that they do not feel safe working in at the moment. 'It is totally devastating that some are frightened to go into work because of the fear of intimidation.' Some medical clinics in Middlesbrough and Hartlepool were also cancelled earlier this week in the face of riots that saw police attacked and cars set on fire, although services have since returned to normal. In Sunderland two Filipino nurses who were on their way to provide emergency cover at a hospital were targeted by far-Right thugs who threw rocks at their taxi. The Royal College of GPs (RCGP) yesterday that there had been 'horrific and unacceptable' abuse and violence towards health workers, 'especially those from ethnic minorities'. A police dog bits a masked protester in Plymouth during clashes on Monday Its chairwoman Professor Kamila Hawthorne : 'We have been shocked and appalled by the civil unrest, criminality and racist attacks we have seen across the UK in recent days. 'We're particularly concerned to hear reports of GPs, members of their teams and other healthcare professionals, especially those from ethnic minorities, being targeted with abuse and violence. This is horrific and completely unacceptable. 'Healthcare professionals dedicate their lives to caring for people in need. They deserve to be able to do their jobs without fear of being attacked or abused and both staff and patients deserve to be able to travel to and from surgeries safely.' One Bristol-based lawyer claimed this morning that he hadn't been so concerned for his own safety in years. Aziz Deen told BBC Breakfast: 'I've been advised to work from home because my office is right where the protests begin, I feel threatened and I haven't felt fear like this since the BNP were in full force. 'Solicitors, especially those focusing on asylum and immigration should not be targeted in anyway. Policy is not in their hands, policy is in the hands of politicians. 'To go after the people who represent asylum seekers and lawful migrants who come here on work sponsorship and the like, to attack them and make them feel threatened is disgraceful.' Last night police in the city met with the Bristol Muslim Strategic Leadership Group (BMSLG) to reassure the community that there will be no threat to mosques and their livelihoods by rioters. Nearly 6,000 public order officers have now been mobilised to respond to riots over, police sources have told the BBC. Pictured: Police officers clash with protesters during the Enough is Enough protest in Whitehall, London A riot police officer is injured during the clashes with far-Right protester outside the Holiday Inn Express in Rotherham Adeela Shafi, of BMSLG, : 'People are feeling scared, intimidated, worried and are not sure where this is going.' She added: 'It's the worst it's been for a long time, because of course we've now got social media you're having messages flying around left right and centre. '[There's] a lot of uncertainty and anxiety, fretfulness about 'what should I do - should I close my business, should I keep my kids at home?' 'Trying to reassure these communities that the police and the authorities are doing their best to keep us safe and for people to be able to go about their usual business. 'At the end of the day we live in a democracy and people should be able to protest, however the disorder we've seen is the frightful thing.' The threat of violence has seen some charities close their doors in a bid to keep people safe. In the north east of England one refugee charity, which has not been named, its volunteers had been racially abused in public, while another people who used its service were 'terrified', the BBC reported. It comes as the wave of anti-immigrant sentiment continues to swirl around on certain online sites, with one group chat on Telegram listing potential targets for today. Towns and cities across England - from Aldershot to Wigan - were named as places for demonstrations, with organisers saying 'they won't stop coming until you tell them...'. One message - posted to the group's 15,000 members - : 'The n*****s will try to abuse the unrest to steal. It's in their blood to do so.' Another called for the death of Nick Lowles, the founder of anti-extremism charity Hope Not Hate. The horrific call-out : 'If anyone wants to go down in a blaze of glory, take this man with you. 'Death to Nick Lowles. Any man who takes his life will be a hero to the cause.' One extremely disturbing reply read: 'How can I do it, I'm game.' Mr Lowles has responded to the threats, calling the man involved 'serious and dangerous'. And a further post told would-be rioters to wear masks, hoodies and leave their phones at home, underneath a photo of a young man in a balaclava and the tagline: 'White n radical.' The channel was set up within hours of the stabbing last week and soon amassed a huge following - but appeared to have been removed on Monday as its membership hit 15,000. WIRED reports that the creator of the channel has attempted to make others since, but they have also been expunged. Telegram told the magazine it was 'actively monitoring the situation and are removing channels and posts containing calls to violence.' The Home Office it could not comment on whether it had asked for the channel to be removed, calling discussions around the subject an 'operational issue'. Riot police officers push back anti-migration protesters outside the Holiday Inn Express Hotel which is housing asylum seekers Police officers face protesters outside the Royal Liver Building in Liverpool on August 3 during the 'Enough is Enough' demonstration Police officers face a demonstrator at the 'Enough is Enough' protest in Whitehall, London last week An assistant chief constable has urged people to ignore a list of locations, which has been shared on social media as possible targets for gatherings, saying police will be waiting. Andy Mariner, of Essex Police, there is 'disinformation on social media' talking about activity in the county on Wednesday, adding: 'Our message is clear - ignore it.' 'If you're planning on coming here intent on disorder, we will be waiting for you, and you will be arrested,' he . 'There is information going around on the internet highlighting specific locations around the country and some of those details of locations are just plain false, including here in Essex.' Nearly 6,000 public order officers have now been mobilised to respond to riots over this week, police sources have told the BBC. They have that the situation is 'manageable' - adding that they hope Britain is now 'through the worst' of the chaos, although they are ready if it escalates again. Violent riots have already exploded across several cities including Manchester, Liverpool, Plymouth and Birmingham following the Southport knife rampage which claimed the lives of three young girls and left many others injured. False speculation online that the teenage suspect was an asylum seeker who had arrived in the UK on a boat has fuelled the unrest which started outside a mosque in Southport and has since spread across the UK. The misinformation is believed to have originated from a Russian-linked fake news website. Misleading posts have since been shared by the likes Andrew Tate, awaiting trial for rape in Romania, and gatherings have been promoted by far-right influencers. Thugs have then taken to the streets under the guise of 'anti-immigration' protesters seeking to 'protect' children - by smashing up cars and attacking mosques. Anti-migration protesters attempt to enter the Holiday Inn Express Hotel which is housing asylum seekers on August 4 As many as 39 areas including immigration centres and lawyers' homes have made up a 'target list' created by far-Right mobs Mounted police move in as violence breaks out in Manchester on Saturday, August 3 Police officers kettle protestors during the 'Enough is Enough' demonstration on Whitehall, outside the entrance to 10 Downing Street in central London However, X, formerly Twitter, is reported to have resisted calls to take down posts that could be seen as inciting violence, according to the Financial Times. Musk took a scythe to its moderation and safety teams after buying the site, which has plummeted in value since its acquisition by the billionaire. Right-wing groups have organised dozens of protests from Liverpool to Hull and Middlesbrough to Plymouth - with many filled with anti-immigrant rhetoric. Riots have seen hotels housing migrants set on fire and police attacked with bricks or bottles. More than 400 people have now been arrested and Director of Public Prosecutions Stephen Parkinson has the thugs could face terrorism charges as the legal system mobilises to bring offenders to justice. The CPS chief hit out at those who had used the internet for the 'purposes of incitement and planning', telling the BBC: 'If you're engaged in that activity, then you can be prosecuted for the substantive offence that you have caused (due) to what you've been doing using the internet.' And in a warning to those acting outside the UK, Mr Parkinson : 'Some people are abroad. That doesn't mean they're safe. 'We have liaison prosecutors spread around the globe who've got local links with the local judiciary and law enforcement, but also the police are also stationed abroad.' In measures reminiscent of the 2011 London riots, magistrates courts are operating round the clock to process rioters and releasing mugshots of some suspects after they have been charged in an effort to name and shame them. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer - who was himself Director of Public Prosecutions between 2008 and 2013 - the criminal justice system has shown a 'robust and swift response' in the face of ongoing unrest. A supposed 'target list' of 39 areas where further riots are planned for Wednesday was yesterday leaked on social media. A police source told The Mirror it was treating the list as a 'credible threat'. 'It's being watched closely and we are ready to respond,' they . 'We have got thousands of extra officers and where there's credible, specific intelligence, officers will be put in place and will be ready to respond immediately.' They added: 'Wednesday is going to be a busy day. We are assessing what is credible and what isn't but we have a lot more resources stood-up now than we did at the weekend. 'Some is planned but also a lot is sporadic in terms of local people seeing stuff online and turning up out of the blue. It's quite a nuanced picture.' A message on encrypted platform Telegram shows that 39 towns and cities could be braced for more violence. Serious violence and rioting by far-Right protesters continues in side streets into the evening A member of the community offers snacks to police officers on the front line in Middlesbrough Residents offer food to police on the front line in Middlesbrough this evening Protesters try to cram into the migrant hotel through a damaged fire exit in Rotherham A man looks out of The Holiday Inn hotel in Rotherham as counter demonstrators stand outside with signs saying 'refugees welcome' A bin on fire outside the Holiday Inn migrant hotel in Rotherham Five of the organisations on the list told the Financial Times they were planning to shut tomorrow and urged employees to work from home. The list includes locations such as Aldershot, Canterbury, Bedford, Birmingham and Derby. The list, which was reposted on social media, came with a threatening caption above it which reads: 'THEY WON'T STOP COMING UNTIL YOU TELL THEM... 'NO MORE IMMIGRATION. 8PM. MASK UP.' It added: 'SPREAD THIS AS FAR AND WIDE AS YOU CAN.' Justice secretary Shabana Mahmood anyone wearing a mask to a riot would be prosecuted. 'It doesn't matter who you are or what you're protesting — if you turn up in a mask, with a weapon, intent on causing disorder, you will face the full force of the law,' she wrote on X. Today - in a show of hope - locals turned out to help chase off youths who had been targeting a local store As many as thirty stood outside the shop in a show of unity as the threat of far-Right action continued in the Northern Irish city Police officers protect themselves from bricks thrown by protesters during the 'Enough is Enough' outside the Liver Building in Liverpool on August 3 Counter-terror officers and detectives from regional crime units are also involved in targeting far-Right ringleaders of the chaos and violence which has swept Britain. Sir Keir Starmer has vowed to take 'all necessary action' to end the far-Right riots. The Prime Minister told Cabinet today that 'people across the country want their streets to be safe and to feel safe in their communities, and we will take all necessary action to bring the disorder to an end'. Among the stories of Brits being targeted by far-Right thugs was the owner of a Middle Eastern supermarket in Belfast, whose shop was 'singled out' by young yobs, as a boy and the shop behind him was pelted with eggs. It allegedly came after the youths tried to steal from the store but were challenged by staff, as the Police Service of Northern Ireland are investigating it as a hate crime. It came after another supermarket, owned by a Syrian man, was torched after rioters targeted it twice.""]"

Mr Walz it was an 'incredibly dangerous, fluid and dynamic' situation, adding that he can 'fully understand the rage' but urged for calm on the streets. The state order came after the twin cities imposed curfews starting at 8p.m. Friday in efforts to bring the rioting and destruction under control. In Detroit last night, officers - many in riot gear - confronted the protesters in the Michigan city and formed lines across streets.

According to the group's Facebook page, at least 1,800 people turned out, although there appeared to be far more. One protester described the death of Floyd, who lived in Houston most of his life, as a 'modern day lynching'. Rebecca Bozeman told DailyMail.com: 'Enough is enough. The people have to come out and do their part or nothing will change. 'It's been 400 years and it's still happening. We saw a modern-day lynching. It should not be happening.' Her friend Sylvia Clinton added: 'Call it what it is. He was lynched. It was a modern-day lynching.' Clinton told DailyMail.com the news today that white cop Derek Chauvin - who knelt on Floyd's neck for eight minutes until he passed out and later died - being charged with murder is not enough, as calls mount for the arrest of the other three officers involved: J Alexander Kueng, Thomas Lane and Tou Thao. Clinton : 'It's not enough. It's not enough for me that one of the officers has been arrested. I feel they should get the remaining three accomplices.

He : 'I don't feel that's enough [for Chauvin to be arrested]. All four of them need to be arrested and all four of them need to be held accountable as we would be if we broke the law. Omar added: 'I believe it starts at the top with legislation. 'They need to start training officers in a certain way, to be more respectful of human life because everyone around here deserves a fair trial.'They're not the judge or the jury. When we do a crime, we go through due process – they need to do that too.' Both Bozeman and Clinton they live in fear of a similar fate to Floyd's being visited on the men in their families. Bozeman : 'We have a lot of black men in our lives: my father, my brother, her son. They're all a part of our lives. 'So when we saw George lying there like that, that could have been any one of them, any one on a daily basis. 'The fact it has taken days just to arrest one officer, that's not right. Even then, to not be sure he will be convicted of something like that… 'We should be sure. And for this to be going on for hundreds of years, at this point, enough is enough.' Clinton added: 'It's a true worry. It's not anything to be played with. It's very valid and the fear is real. Very real.'

'They need to start training officers in a certain way, to be more respectful of human life because everyone around here deserves a fair trial.'They're not the judge or the jury. When we do a crime, we go through due process – they need to do that too.' Both Bozeman and Clinton they live in fear of a similar fate to Floyd's being visited on the men in their families. Bozeman : 'We have a lot of black men in our lives: my father, my brother, her son. They're all a part of our lives. 'So when we saw George lying there like that, that could have been any one of them, any one on a daily basis. 'The fact it has taken days just to arrest one officer, that's not right. Even then, to not be sure he will be convicted of something like that… 'We should be sure. And for this to be going on for hundreds of years, at this point, enough is enough.'

Minneapolis: Heavy machinery is seen on fire during a demonstration against the death in Minneapolis police custody of George Floyd Minneapolis: Residents defied the curfew and came out for the fourth night and torched buildings Minneapolis: A protester holds their hand up in a fist amid calls for justice for the 46-year-old father of two Minneapolis: People run during a demonstration against the death in Minneapolis police custody Minneapolis: People loot a Wells Fargo ATM despite the curfew and National Guard presence Minneapolis: A convenience store is looted and a building is on fire as chaos continues into the fourth night Minneapolis: Boarded up doors and windows have been ripped down as people emerge from stores damaged other nights with snacks Minneapolis: A convenience store is left ransacked by looters overnight Friday Minneapolis: A looter smashes up a burning liquor store with a bat as Governor Walz urged residents to comply with the curfew Minneapolis: Looting and fires broke out again in Minneapolis as protesters defied the state curfew and the National Guard failed to keep the city under control Shocking footage showed an officer throwing a woman the ground. The video was posted on social media of the cop appearing to walk to the woman and throw her violently to the floor. It was reported that the woman had to seek medical attention following the incident. An MTA bus driver refused to drive protesters away from the scene after police officers commandeered the vehicle and started placing arrested New Yorkers on it. This came after violent clashes broke out in Union Square in Manhattan between cops and protesters during the day. Shocking footage shows one officer beating a protester to the point that he breaks his baton on the man as other cops try to apprehend people in the crowded Manhattan area. Another clip shows officers pushing people to the ground as protesters try to help others from the grasps of the authorities. Some police can be heard telling others to back up. Washington DC: The protests have reached the seat of the US government, with protesters marching to the White House, sending it into lockdown for a brief time Friday night Washington DC: Secret Service agents form a line outside the White House and push protesters back with their shields Washington DC: Protesters hold signs as they gather outside the White House Washington DC: Violence has erupted across the US for a fourth night Friday, with protesters gathering at the home of US democracy Washington DC Washington DC: Police officers tackle a protesters to the ground as people gather outside the White House Washington DC: People hold aloft signs reading 'Terrorist in the White House' and 'Stop killer cops' Washington DC: Crowds followed law enforcement and the man to the jail and staged another protest outside - this one calling for a medic for the man after he was seen with blood pouring down his face, sparking renewed fears over police brutality and for the safety of a man held in custody Washington DC: The White House went into lockdown as one protester above tried to scale the walls Washington DC: The man detained by Secret Service agents outside the White House is covered in blood The protests reached the seat of the US government Friday night, with demonstrators marching to the White House, sending it into lockdown for a brief time Friday night. Secret Service officers stopped anyone entering the White House grounds, where President Trump is currently in residence, after a demonstrator tried to scale the fence in Lafayette Park to get inside. The man was manhandled by Secret Service out of the park and taken into custody at the Treasury Annex. Crowds followed law enforcement and the man to the jail and staged another protest outside - this one calling for a medic for the man after he was seen with blood pouring down his face, sparking renewed fears over police brutality and for the safety of a man held in police custody. Secret Service agents were also seen physically pushing demonstrators back after some pushed down metal railings while a police cruiser was seen burning in the road after it was torched by rioters. As Trump sits securely locked inside the grounds, outrage continues to boil over his Tweets warning protesters that 'when the looting starts the shooting starts.' Louisville, Kentucky: Tensions mounted between law enforcement and protesters for a second night Louisville, Kentucky: Police in riot gear form a wall against protesters marching over the death of Breonna Taylor Louisville, Kentucky: Officials the groups were larger than the previous night Louisville, Kentucky: People huddle as they are struck by pepper-balls fired by police during a protest against the deaths of Breonna Taylor Los Angeles: A protester is seen - wearing a face mask to protect against COVID-19 - while smashing up a police car Los Angeles: As night fell, protesters and police continued to clash on a highay Los Angeles, California: A protester is detained by police officers as hundreds gathered demanding justice for Floyd The lockdown was lifted around 8:30p.m. and as of 11p.m. Trump was yet to break his silence on the matter on Twitter. In Minneapolis, Mayor Jacob Frey announced a nighttime curfew barring anyone other than essential workers and public safety personnel from being in public places across the city from 8p.m. through to 6 a.m. local time and lasting for the weekend. This was quickly followed by the neighboring cities of Roseville and St. Paul which declared their own emergency orders and curfews. But this failed to keep Minneapolis under control with protesters defying the curfew and convenience stores looted. With law enforcement nowhere to be seen, around 350 troops were finally sent in after midnight - hours after chaos ensued once again despite both the city and state insisting that the response would be ramped up Friday. Las Vegas: Over in Sin City, hundreds of protesters took over parts of the Las Vegas Strip Friday night Las Vegas: Demonstrators and police officers were seen in a standoff at multiple intersections of the strip where casinos continue to stay shuttered amid the coronavirus pandemic The Minneapolis Department of Public Safety 350 troopers had been deployed to the city's 5th precinct to disperse protesters and enforce the curfew late Friday. This came after Walz on Friday admitted an 'abject failure' by law enforcement in trying to control crowds Thursday night. On Thursday, as tensions in the city boiled all day, the National Guard started putting in motion plans to intervene to help local law enforcement agencies that were struggling to cope with the mounting threat. Meanwhile, in Sin City, hundreds of protesters took over parts of the Las Vegas Strip Friday night with police confirming several arrests had been made. Demonstrators and police officers were seen in a standoff at multiple intersections of the strip where casinos continue to stay shuttered amid the coronavirus pandemic. Protests escalated in Louisville, Kentucky, as protesters demanding justice for black woman Breonna Taylor resurfaced with renewed anger over Floyd's death. Taylor was shot dead by cops in the state back in March. The EMT was hit by bullets at least eight times when three cops stormed her apartment to serve a search warrant over a narcotics investigation. No drugs were found in the home. The Hall of Justice was targeted with an attempted fire while graffiti and flag-burning was widespread across the city.

Pictures showed groups of people huddling on the ground as pepper balls rained down on them. Louisville Metro Police Department a significantly larger number of people had come out to protest Friday compared to Thursday many armed with sticks, bats, and guns. This came after seven people were shot after gunfire rung out in downtown Louisville Thursday night. In Houston, where Floyd grew up before he moved to Minneapolis for a new start in life, huge protests also erupted. The demonstration, which was organized by Black Lives Matter, saw thousands of protesters process up Main Street to City Hall shouting 'can't breathe' and 'enough is enough'. The initially peaceful protest took a violent turn two hours in after a man attempted to punch organizer Ashton Woods as he made a speech. Brooklyn: NYPD Officers spray mace into the crowd of protesters gathered at Barclays Center Brooklyn: A fire is started in the street and objects are hurled as protests ramp up in New York Brooklyn: Police officers are seen struggling to keep protesters back as they push against railings Brooklyn: One man is arrested and being carried off by officers outside the stadium that is currently shuttered due to the COVID-19 pandemic Brooklyn: Police try to contain protesters during a rally at the Barclays Center Brooklyn: The protest started peacefully as the group gathered and held signs demanding justice Brooklyn: A huge 'George Floyd' banner is held aloft by the crowd before night fell Although the scuffle was swiftly broken up by police, some demonstrators moved away from the main protest and attempted to rush and occupy the I-45 freeway. Others in the throng chanted: 'Justice for George', 'Black Lives Matter' and 'We want change'. According to the group's Facebook page, at least 1,800 people turned out, although there appeared to be far more. One protester described the death of Floyd, who lived in Houston most of his life, as a 'modern day lynching'. Rebecca Bozeman told DailyMail.com: 'Enough is enough. The people have to come out and do their part or nothing will change. 'It's been 400 years and it's still happening. We saw a modern-day lynching. It should not be happening.' Her friend Sylvia Clinton added: 'Call it what it is. He was lynched. It was a modern-day lynching.' Clinton told DailyMail.com the news today that white cop Derek Chauvin - who knelt on Floyd's neck for eight minutes until he passed out and later died - being charged with murder is not enough, as calls mount for the arrest of the other three officers involved: J Alexander Kueng, Thomas Lane and Tou Thao. Clinton : 'It's not enough. It's not enough for me that one of the officers has been arrested. I feel they should get the remaining three accomplices. 'Call it what it is – an accomplice is someone in conjunction with a crime and I feel like that's what the three remaining officers are and it will not be justice until we see them arrested, prosecuted and found guilty.' Minneapolis: A protester yells at a member of the Minnesota National Guard earlier Friday Minneapolis: Amid fears that the chaos is entering a fourth night, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz Friday signed an emergency order mandating that residents stay home from the hours of 8p.m. to 6a.m. Minneapolis: Cops have been given the power to arrest anyone who refuses to comply with the curfew Minneapolis: Police officers hold down a man during Friday's protest as a curfew is put in place Another protester police officers who commit crimes should face the same 'due process' as regular citizens. He : 'I don't feel that's enough [for Chauvin to be arrested]. All four of them need to be arrested and all four of them need to be held accountable as we would be if we broke the law. Omar added: 'I believe it starts at the top with legislation. 'They need to start training officers in a certain way, to be more respectful of human life because everyone around here deserves a fair trial.'They're not the judge or the jury. When we do a crime, we go through due process – they need to do that too.' Both Bozeman and Clinton they live in fear of a similar fate to Floyd's being visited on the men in their families. Bozeman : 'We have a lot of black men in our lives: my father, my brother, her son. They're all a part of our lives. 'So when we saw George lying there like that, that could have been any one of them, any one on a daily basis. 'The fact it has taken days just to arrest one officer, that's not right. Even then, to not be sure he will be convicted of something like that… 'We should be sure. And for this to be going on for hundreds of years, at this point, enough is enough.' Clinton added: 'It's a true worry. It's not anything to be played with. It's very valid and the fear is real. Very real.' Houston: In Houston, where Floyd grew up before he moved to Minneapolis for a new start in life, huge protests erupted Friday as people insisted that this is not Houston: Protesters wear COVID-19 face masks with 'I can't breathe' written on them - some of the last words Floyd as he begged for his life Houston: One protester holds a sign with pictures of other black men who have died in the US Protests also erupted in Charlotte with police officers throwing tear gas into the crowds and the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Department deploying its Civil Emergency Unit and issuing a dispersal order. Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin was arrested and charged with murder and manslaughter Friday over the death of Floyd, four days after he was seen kneeling on his neck in a video of his arrest that has sparked violent protests across the country. The 44-year-old white cop was arrested by state investigators Friday afternoon, Public Safety Commissioner John Harrington announced, as the criminal complaint revealed he kept kneeling on the black man's neck for almost 3 minutes after he fell unconscious and 'you're talking fine' when he begged for air. Chauvin was one of four officers fired over Floyd's death earlier this week yet the other three officers continue to walk free.

The Labour leader also indicated that his Party will back the Government in a vote on a new England-wide lockdown due to take place in the House of Commons next week. He welcomed Prime Minister Boris Johnson's plans to plunge the country into a second shutdown, but told reporters yesterday that it should have happened 'weeks ago'. Sir Keir had previously called on the Government to impose a 'circuit breaker' lockdown on the UK for two to three weeks, warning that 'sacrifices' would have to be made to suppress the virus. Meanwhile, London Mayor Sadiq Khan tweeted that he was 'furious' that the Government had 'dithered and delayed', saying their 'indecision will have unimaginable consequences' for 'lives and livelihoods'. And Leader of the Liberal Democrats Sir Ed Davey called the Tory Government 'an utter shambles', tweeting: 'Through dither and delay they have cost jobs and lives. PM must ensure people have the support they need through this lockdown - and start work on a UK wide plan for Christmas.' Chancellor Rishi Sunak the furlough scheme, which ended today, will be extended for a further month, with the Treasury covering 80 per cent of employees' wages to prevent further unemployment. But Greater Manchester mayor Andy Burnham reacted angrily to this, with the Government having refused to grant the subsidy for the region as they battled over Tier 3 measures. Mr Burnham that 'when we asked you to do that for the lowest-paid people in the North, you refused', adding: 'People here will remember that.' Liverpool region mayor Steve Rotheram added: 'Now we know for sure that the Government thinks workers in the North were worth 13 per cent less than those in the South.' It comes as the Prime Minister last night announced that England will be plunged into a second shutdown, due to take effect from midnight on Thursday until December 2. As England braces for a second national lockdown: The UK recorded 326 deaths within 28 days of testing positive for Covid-19 and 21,915 lab-confirmed cases; The National Education Union called for schools and colleges to be shut as part of the lockdown; Health Minister Government could only have predicted need for a second lockdown with 'crystal ball'; SAGE adviser warned Covid-19 is 'running riot' across all age groups and hospitals are at risk of being overrun; Number of virus patients in hospital has doubled in the past fortnight, with 10,708 patients being treated; ONS 50,000 people were being infected with Covid-19 each day, with 274 deaths reported yesterday; A poll by anti-lockdown group Recovery found that more than 70 per cent of people were more worried about the effect of lockdown than they were of catching Covid. Sir Keir Starmer last night called for a second national lockdown to start immediately as the Labour Party claimed vindication for calling for a 'circuit-breaker' two weeks ago. The Labour leader also indicated that his Party will back the Government in a vote on a new England-wide lockdown due to take place in the House of Commons next week London Mayor Sadiq Khan tweeted that he was 'furious' that the Government had 'dithered and delayed yet again' Boris Johnson effectively took the country back to square one as he unveiled a new national month-long lockdown to avoid a 'medical and moral disaster' - ordering the public to stay at home until December 2 Sir Keir told reporters: 'Everybody is concerned about the rise in infections, the hospital admissions and tragically the number of deaths. That's why three weeks ago, I called for circuit-break. Key points in COVID lockdown Mark 2 Restrictions will start at midnight on Thursday morning and last until December 2. People can only leave their homes for specific reasons, such as to do essential shopping, for outdoor exercise, and for work if they are unable to work from home. Non-essential shops will be told to shut, although supermarkets do not need to close off aisles as has happened in Wales. Restaurants and bars will be told to close unless they can operate a takeaway service. Leisure centres, gyms, sporting venues, hairdressers and beauty parlours will have to close, although professional sport will continue. Key businesses that cannot operate remotely - such as construction - should carry on as before with safety precautions. Places of worship can stay open for private prayer. Funerals are limited to close family only. The furlough scheme will be extended during the period of the lockdown, rather than ending tomorrow as originally planned. Exercise is permitted with no limits on frequency, but organised sports - including outdoor activities such as golf - will not be permitted. When the lockdown lapses the Tiers system will be reinstated, leaving questions about what metric will be used to decide whether areas can have restrictions eased. Advertisement 'The Government completely rejected that only now to announce the self-same thing. Alas the delay now will cost, the lockdown will be longer, it'll be harder and there's a human cost which will be very, very real. 'Now, there's no denying these measures are necessary and I'm glad that the Government has finally taken the decision that it should have taken weeks ago.' He indicated Labour will back the Government in a Commons vote on the shutdown, calling the measures 'necessary' but warning against further delay. Asked about the restrictions not coming into force until Thursday, the Labour leader told reporters that they should be brought in 'swiftly'. 'The last thing we need is days before restrictions come in. If they're necessary, they're necessary now,' he added. Sir Keir added it was unfair to pretend to the public that Christmas 'will be normal', telling reporters: 'This lockdown is going on to at least December 2, everybody's seen the figures, and, therefore, I don't think it's fair to pretend that Christmas is going to be normal in any sense of the word. 'I think we need to level with the public on that. Responding to the No10 press conference, Mr Khan accused the Prime Minister of choosing to 'completely ignore the expert, scientific advice'. 'Acting early and decisively is the best way to control this virus, which is why I and many others urged the Government to listen to SAGE and introduce a short, national, circuit breaker weeks ago when it could have saved lives and done the least damage to our economy,' the Mayor of London tweeted. 'The Government's delay means that case numbers are now too high for a short, sharp, circuit breaker to be effective. This has left the Prime Minister with no choice but to introduce a longer national lockdown. 'It is absolutely imperative that the Government does not repeat its dithering when it comes to the additional economic support that will now clearly be needed. 'Ministers have a once-in-a-generation responsibility to provide whatever public funding is needed to prop up our economy and support businesses and jobs through this period of much tighter restrictions. The Chancellor needs to stand up urgently and that he will do whatever it takes for as long as is needed.' In his statement on the new lockdown measures in England, Mr Khan added: 'The Prime Minister has done the right thing by extending the furlough scheme which was due to end tomorrow - but he must immediately confirm that it will be at 80 per cent of wages for everyone who needs it. 'Government support must also include direct grants and loans for businesses in the sectors likely to be worst affected to be made available now. 'I would like to make a direct appeal to all Londoners as your Mayor: Thank you for the enormous sacrifices you have made over the last seven months. You may not agree with or like the Government's latest restrictions. 'However, we must all follow them. Please continue following the restrictions and public health guidance. We must act to protect each other. Mr Khan accused the PM of 'completely ignor[ing] the expert, scientific advice'. 'Acting early and decisively is the best way to control this virus, which is why I and many others urged the Government to listen to SAGE and introduce a short, national, circuit breaker weeks ago when it could have saved lives and done the least damage to our economy,' he tweeted Labour's shadow chancellor Anneliese Dodds blasted the Government's 'inexcusable' 'lack of clarity on support' 'I know it won't be easy, but history tells us that Londoners always pull together in times of crisis. We must once again make huge collective sacrifices now in order to prevent even greater suffering later. 'I will continue to lobby the Government to finally sort out a fully functioning test and trace system and the financial support London needs. I promise you that our city will get through this together.' Labour's shadow chancellor Anneliese Dodds blasted the Government's 'inexcusable' 'lack of clarity on support'. She tweeted: 'Dither and delay has damaged public health. After the PM's speech, many will be wondering how they'll cope - from the self-employed to those on short contracts, and seeking work.' Boris Johnson brings in the Army to help roll out 'rapid turnaround' tests for Covid for 'whole cities' within days Boris Johnson will bring in the Army to help roll out 'rapid turnaround tests' which will see 'whole cities' able to tested for Covid within days. The Prime Minister made the announcement at a Downing Street press conference this evening, as he plunged the nation back into a full lockdown until December 2. Government scientific advisers have endorsed Mr Johnson's £100billion Operation Moonshot, which would see 10 million people tested a day regardless of whether they have symptoms, in a paper submitted to Downing St last month. Population-wide testing has the ability to slash Covid-19's reproduction rate in half, the experts . Britain's overall R rate - the average number of people each Covid-19 patient infects - is estimated to be as high as 1.5, which has sparked the PM into launching fresh action. Advertisement Shadow Business Secretary Ed Miliband slammed the Prime Minister's 'terrible misjudgement' for having 'delayed necessary for so long'. He tweeted: 'Vital now that businesses and workers are properly supported, yet total silence from government on support for the self-employed and grants for most businesses significantly less than in first lockdown.' Meanwhile, the leader of Bradford Council the announcement of new coronavirus measures is 'confusing' for West Yorkshire residents who had been preparing for Tier 3 restrictions on Monday. Councillor Susan Hinchcliffe she had been assured there would not be a national lockdown during discussions with the Government last week about West Yorkshire entering the very high level of measures. Following the announcement of new national measures by the Prime Minister today, the West Yorkshire Combined Authority the area would no longer enter Tier 3 on Monday as planned. Ms Hinchcliffe : 'I asked the Secretary of State twice last week whether the country was going into national lockdown and was told firmly no. 'This latest Government announcement, coming only two days after the announcement that Bradford and West Yorkshire was to enter Tier 3 very high restrictions, will understandably therefore be confusing for residents and businesses alike. 'All the Tier 3 regulations we briefed residents and businesses on on Friday are now irrelevant and we must wait for fresh information from Government on Monday. 'Just a couple of days ago Government were impressing upon us, as leaders in West Yorkshire, that the health emergency was very urgent. 'The new Tier 3 restrictions were therefore due to start Monday. Now we hear it's going to be national restrictions from Thursday. 'If it was urgent on Thursday, it's certainly urgent today and I would therefore make a plea to all residents and businesses to be extra careful from now on, don't wait until Thursday to exercise extra caution.' 'A devastating blow for industry': Business leaders despair at new restrictions and it 'will be much harder to survive' - and plead with government to fix testing to avoid a THIRD lockdown Boris Johnson's new raft of restrictions have dealt 'a devastating blow' to business communities, the head of British Chambers of Commerce has . Industry leaders insist it will now be 'much harder' for firms to survive, even as the much-trumpeted furlough scheme was extended for another month, and have pleaded with the government to fix testing to avoid a third lockdown. After weeks insisting he is sticking to local restrictions, the PM completed a humiliating U-turn by announcing blanket coronavirus restrictions for England at a press conference alongside medical and science chiefs Chris Whitty and Patrick Vallance. The draconian measures - being billed as 'Tier Four' on the government's sliding scale - come into force from midnight Thursday morning after bleak Sage modelling projected the virus could kill 85,000 this winter, far above the previous 'reasonable worst case'. The brutal squeeze will see non-essential shops in England shut until December 2, as well as bars and restaurants despite the 'absolutely devastating' impact on the already crippled hospitality sector. It emerged earlier this month that the UK economy grew by just 2.1 per cent in August as the recovery from the pandemic's impact stalled despite Rishi Sunak's Eat Out to Help Out scheme - down on the 6.4 per cent expansion recorded in July. Advertisement On Thursday, it was announced the two million residents in Leeds, Bradford, Calderdale, Wakefield and Kirklees would be subject to Tier 3 restrictions from Monday, after local authorities agreed a financial support package from the Government worth an additional £59.3million. Ms Hinchcliffe urged residents to stay at home if they could, wash their hands and wear face coverings indoors ahead of the introduction of new measures next week. She added: 'The infection rate is extremely high and our hospitals are getting an increasing number of admissions. 'We are determined to work with our West Yorkshire partners to make sure we get the right support for our area so that we limit the damage these restrictions will cause for businesses and communities.' The Prime Minister effectively took the country back to square one as he unveiled the new national lockdown to avoid a 'medical and moral disaster'. After weeks insisting he is sticking to local restrictions, he completed a humiliating U-turn by announcing blanket restrictions for England at a press conference alongside Chris Whitty and Patrick Vallance. Mr Johnson the draconian measures - which come into force from midnight Thursday morning until December 2 - were the only way to avert bleak Sage predictions of 85,000 deaths this winter, far above the previous 'reasonable worst case'. He otherwise doctors would have to choose between saving Covid sufferers and those with other illnesses. The Prime Minister pointed out that the action was not the same as March as key sectors of the economy are under orders to stay open, but he was 'under no illusions' about how tough it would be. He declared that the furlough scheme will be extended for the period, rather than ending tomorrow as originally planned. He also refused to rule out extending the measures beyond the proposed end date. Asked if the time would be enough, the premier : 'I hope so. We have every reason to believe it will be.' Announcing the extension of furlough payments for the month of shutdown, Chancellor Rishi Sunak : 'Over the past eight months of this crisis we have helped millions of people to continue to provide for their families. But now - along with many other countries around the world - we face a tough winter ahead. 'I have always that we will do whatever it takes as the situation evolves. Now, as restrictions get tougher, we are taking steps to provide further financial support to protect jobs and businesses. 'These changes will provide a vital safety net for people across the UK. North of the border, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon told Scots not to travel to England unless it is for 'essential purposes' as Mr Johnson announced a second national lockdown. Miss Sturgeon she and the Scottish Government will seek clarity over the furlough extension announced by Mr Johnson, adding such support would make an impact on decisions previously taken north of the border. However, she the devolved administration 'will take considered decisions based on what is right for Scotland'. Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, pictured here in the Scottish Parliament on Thursday, has urged Scots not to travel to England as it was announced England would go into a four-week lockdown next week until December 2 Travel firms warn of 'complete shutdown' across industry when England reenters shutdown Travel firms have warned of a 'complete shutdown' across the industry when England goes back into lockdown next week. Travel and overnight stays in the UK and abroad will be restricted when the 'stay home' instruction comes into effect nationwide again from Thursday. According to Government guidance issued on Saturday night: 'This includes staying in a second home, if you own one, or staying with anyone you do not live with or are in a support bubble with.' Mark Tanzer, chief executive of Abta, the rules 'will mean a complete shutdown for travel businesses which have already been severely damaged by the pandemic', but added 'public health must come first'. Budget airline easyJet has called for 'urgent' support for the sector, similar to that which has been provided to hospitality. Chief executive Johan Lundgren : 'Given the steps the Government has taken, which essentially prevents air travel in the UK, our call for sector specific support has never been more urgent. 'The Government has recognised the need to directly support the hospitality sector, where decisions have directly affected its ability to trade. 'The same principle needs to be applied to aviation. The Government's own statistics show that activity in aviation is already 90% down on pre-pandemic levels, yet to date the Government has still failed to provide any sector specific support.' The sentiments were echoed by Airlines UK, which : 'Aviation has been devastated by the pandemic, and has essentially never had the opportunity to recover.' The trade body has called for 'a comprehensive restart package' for the industry. It in a statement: 'This needs to include immediate additional economic support for the winter and steps to support recovery, including urgent rollout of a testing regime, business rates relief for airports, and an emergency waiver of Air Passenger Duty that will be essential for enabling and stimulating international travel - absolutely vital for the UK economy - for as long as we are living with this virus. 'Hundreds of thousands of jobs and our economic recovery are on the line.' Advertisement Miss Sturgeon the prevalence of the virus is lower in Scotland than in other parts of the UK, after stricter measures were introduced north of the border in September. Those saw Scots barred from going into other people's homes, and the Scottish Government also acted to close bars and restaurants across the central belt in early October. In Scotland, a new five-tier levels of restriction will come into effect on Monday - with Levels 1, 2 and 3 broadly comparable to the three tiers of restrictions currently in place in England. In Level 3 areas – the second highest tier in the new Scottish system and which affects the central belt including Glasgow and Edinburgh, as well as Ayrshire and Dundee – people are urged not to go outside of their own local authority area. In a series of tweets urging Scots to stick to the new rules, Ms Sturgeon also people are being asked not to travel to or from England. She : 'People should not travel to or from Level 3 areas in Scotland and for now, we are asking people not to travel to or from England at all, except for essential purposes.' With regards to the furlough extension announced by Johnson, Sturgeon : 'We expect to have further discussion in the coming days about the scope of additional financial support being made available. 'A crucial point for us is whether support on the scale announced for English businesses is available for Scottish businesses now or if we needed to impose further restrictions later - or if it is only available if Scotland has a full lockdown at the same time as a lockdown in England. 'However, notwithstanding the above, today's developments should be a reminder to people across Scotland of the need to follow the rules and not to put their own twist on them. 'It is important we all comply with the rules in our area if we are to successfully suppress the virus, protect the NHS and keep as many businesses and services open.' In another tweet responding to news the extension until December would be UK-wide, she : 'This is good and expected. But a key question - is it only available during the period of English lockdown? 'Or will it be available in event a devolved gov thinks it necessary to have tougher restrictions at a later stage?' Scottish Government ministers and SNP MPs have made repeated calls for furlough to be extended since Chancellor Rishi Sunak in September the scheme would end this month. Miss Sturgeon has also previously warned the new measures in Scotland represent the best chance of avoiding another national lockdown. She added: 'People across Scotland have faced significant restrictions since late September as we work to stop the increase in Covid cases across the country. 'Prevalence of the virus is currently lower in Scotland than in other parts of the UK and there are some signs that those earlier restrictions may be starting to slow the rate of increase. 'We will not hesitate to increase the level of protection either locally or nationally if required. Our new levels approach - including a potential Level 4 - enables us to respond quickly and flexibly as required. 'We are also asking that people do not travel to England, or from England into Scotland unless absolutely essential, just as we are also asking people not to go to Northern Ireland or to Wales.' The models that predict up to 4,000 coronavirus deaths a day from the second wave - WORSE than SAGE's 'reasonable worst case scenario' By Jack Wright for MailOnline England's chief public health officials last night unveiled grim graphs that show how all models of the coronavirus second wave predict the number of deaths will exceed SAGE's 'worst cases scenario'. At the heart of the scientific data supporting Boris Johnson's decision to plunge England into a second lockdown was a graph comparing the predictions of a number of academic modelling groups including Imperial College. They show the number of deaths peaking at 4,000 deaths a day without intervention, their reasonable worst case scenario for the winter had predicted a maximum of around 800 deaths a day. Speaking at a Downing Street press conference, Professor Chris Whitty and Sir Patrick Vallance that England is currently experiencing 'around 50,000 new cases a day'. Citing Office for National Statistics data, the chief medical officer for England alleged the 'prevalence of this disease has been going up extremely rapidly over the last few weeks'. Prof Whitty that the rate of transmission had been 'very flat due to the work of everybody in the country over Spring and Summer' before claiming that NHS England hospitalisations are now rising 'exponentially'. He that the number of people in hospital beds will exceed the peak of the first wave without further measures, adding that there is an increase in prevalence 'in virtually every part of the country', apart from possibly the North East where stricter measures are in place, and cases are not constrained to one age group. The chief medical officer for England : 'Currently only in the North West is this coming close to the peak that we previously had, but it is increasing in every area. And if we do nothing, the inevitable result is these numbers will go up and they will eventually exceed the peak that we saw in the spring of this year.' Sir Patrick, the UK's chief scientific adviser, then that if cases keep rising, 'in terms of deaths over the winter, there's the potential for this to be twice as bad, or more, compared to the first wave'. Most of SAGE's models peak at around 2,000 deaths from the virus per day during the winter and predict that hospitalisations are likely to peak in mid-December, with deaths rising until at least late December. Meanwhile, a separate paper circulating in Whitehall warns that the NHS would be unable to accept any more patients by Christmas, even if the Nightingale hospitals were used. This document, which is based on NHS England modelling from October 28, claims that south-west England and the Midlands will be the first to run out of capacity within two weeks. It comes as Mr Johnson yesterday announced that England will be plunged into a second national shutdown, due to take effect from midnight on Thursday until December 2. People must stay at home unless for specific reasons, such as attending school or college, or going to the supermarket, while hospitality venues and non-essential shops will be shut. Childcare, early years settings, schools, colleges and universities will remain open, with the Prime Minister telling the press conference: 'We cannot let this virus damage our children's futures even more than it has already'. England's chief public health officials unveiled grim graphs that show how all models of the coronavirus second wave predict the number of deaths will exceed SAGE's 'worst cases scenario'.

But infections, which can represent the current situation more accurately, were down five per cent on a week ago at 21,915 England's chief public health officials last night unveiled grim graphs that show how all models of the coronavirus second wave predict the number of deaths will exceed SAGE's 'worst cases scenario' Mr Johnson it would be a 'medical and moral disaster, beyond the raw loss of life' if the NHS was overrun, claiming: 'The sheer weight of Covid demand would mean depriving tens of thousands, if not hundreds of thousands, if not millions of non-Covid patients of the care they need.' The Prime Minister described the pandemic as 'a constant struggle and a balance that any Government has to make between lives and livelihoods, and obviously lives must come first'. Key points in COVID lockdown Mark 2 Restrictions will start at midnight on Thursday morning and last until December 2. People can only leave their homes for specific reasons, such as to do essential shopping, for outdoor exercise, and for work if they are unable to work from home. Non-essential shops will be told to shut, although supermarkets do not need to close off aisles as has happened in Wales. Restaurants and bars will be told to shut unless they can operate a takeaway service. Businesses that cannot operate remotely - such as construction - should continue as before. Exercise is permitted with no limits on frequency, but organised sports - including outdoor activities such as golf - will not be permitted. When the lockdown lapses the Tiers system will be reinstated, leaving questions about what metric will be used to decide whether areas can have restrictions eased. Advertisement He added: 'Yes it is true that the course of the pandemic has changed and it's also right that the Government should change and modulate its response in accordance, and I make absolutely no apologies for that.' Cabinet sources leaked news of the impending month-long shutdown to the Mail last night after the Government's scientists warned Mr Johnson that Covid-19 cases in the UK are accelerating faster than their worst-case scenario' of 85,000 coronavirus deaths this winter, with 1,000 deaths a day by December. Another 326 UK fatalities were declared today - nearly double last Saturday's tally. But infections, which can represent the current situation more accurately, were down five per cent on a week ago at 21,915. This week papers from a meeting of the SAGE committee showed that scientists warned ministers two weeks ago that Britain could be headed for a more serious situation than their worst projections. The document, dated October 14, which was released online, claimed 'we are breaching the number of infections and hospital admissions in the Reasonable Worst Case planning scenario' before adding that the outlooks for Covid-19's future spread was 'concerning' if no action was taken. According to briefings from advisers, they believe there is still time to save Christmas with a lockdown of at least a month that closes restaurants, pubs and all but essential shops. The experts believe soaring cases mean the UK could face 1,000 deaths a day within a month and exceed 85,000 coronavirus deaths. The SAGE papers from two weeks ago warned that modelling suggested that up to 74,000 people a day could be becoming infected in England alone, far beyond the worst case scenario. There is a lag of around three weeks between infections and deaths. The scientists told ministers that without further restrictions, the death toll will keep rising exponentially, and hospitals will be overwhelmed. Separate Office for National Statistics (ONS) figures found daily coronavirus infections in England surged by 50 per cent last week. It estimated that almost 52,000 people were catching the virus every day and one in every 100 people in the country were infected with Covid-19 a week ago. The weekly update is far lower than another Government-funded study, called REACT-1, which claimed there were 96,000 new cases per day by October 25, putting the current outbreak on par with levels seen in the first wave. Boris Johnson effectively took the country back to square one last night as he unveiled a dramatic new national month-long lockdown to avoid a 'medical and moral disaster' - ordering the public to stay at home At the heart of the scientific data supporting Boris Johnson's decision to plunge England into a second lockdown was a graph comparing the predictions of a number of academic modelling groups including Imperial College Data from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) estimated almost 52,000 people were catching the virus every day and one in every 100 people in the country were infected with Covid-19 a week ago Separate data from King's College London predicted England has around 32,000 cases per day and claimed infections are rising 'steadily' and 'have not spiralled out of control' However yesterday, other researchers at King's College London, predicted England has around 32,000 new symptomatic cases per day and claimed infections are rising 'steadily' and 'have not spiralled out of control'. Experts there was 'no choice' but to enter 2nd national shutdown Experts have that there was 'no choice' but to enter a second national lockdown. Academics have that the decision was 'painful but necessary'. The move could save thousands of lives and prevent the NHS from becoming 'swamped', they added. Dr Shaun Fitzgerald, Royal Academy of Engineering visiting professor at the University of Cambridge, : 'We know how this horrible virus is transmitted. 'The means we have to intersect the modes of transmission are washing hands, wearing face coverings, keeping our distance, ventilating rooms and seriously limiting our social interactions - this last one is the ultimate weapon in our fight. 'If we aren't mixing, the virus hasn't got a chance of spreading. We are spending more time indoors which is compounding our ability to keep the spread at bay. 'The numbers right now mean we need to go harder at breaking the transmission. This second lockdown is all about that - us, not the Government, hitting it hard. 'None of us want this at all. But there is no choice if we are to avoid letting thousands and thousands more die, and the health service swamped to an extent that even non-Covid patients are seriously affected.' Dr Rupert Beale, from the Francis Crick Institute, : 'The decision to enter a second period of national lockdown is a painful one but clearly necessary. 'I urge everyone to obey the rules: this will ensure we spend the minimum time under these very restrictive and costly measures. 'The Prime Minister mentioned the imminent arrival of new rapid tests. How effectively these are deployed, and how well our Test, Trace, Isolate and Support system can work will determine whether we will be able to avoid repeated lockdowns.' Dr Michael Head, senior research fellow in global health at the University of Southampton, : 'There's over 11,000 Covid-19 patients in NHS hospitals, with more than 1,000 patients being admitted every day, and increasing numbers of healthcare staff off work with a positive Covid-19 test. 'That is simply not sustainable. 'With so much resource dedicated towards infection control, a health service overloaded with severely ill Covid-19 patients cannot also fully accommodate, for example, cancer and stroke patients. Therefore, any intervention that reduces the burdens of Covid-19 is also good for other patients too. 'These measures should have been announced several weeks ago. 'However, even at this stage, these newly-announced measures should help to provide some level of control the community transmission. 'With any significant reduction in cases, the Government simply has to use that 'breathing space' to fix the Serco-led contact tracing system. 'Control of this should be passed over to local health protection teams, ensuring that more contacts of cases are reached, which will help to keep cases at a lower level and minimise the spread of new outbreaks.' Advertisement The competing projections have led to confusion over how bad the current rate of coronavirus infections is. Professor Tim Spector, the epidemiologist behind the King's study, the spread of Covid-19 currently appears 'steady' and may even be slowing in Scotland. The team estimated that Britain's cases are doubling once a month. The worrying figures from SAGE are behind the Prime Minister's decision to announce a new national lockdown after his scientific advisers told him it was the only way to save Christmas.. SAGE - the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies, which is made up of senior scientists and disease experts -presented their analysis to the Government on October 14. They warned: 'In England, we are breaching the number of infections and hospital admissions in the Reasonable Worst Case planning scenario that is based on Covid's winter planning strategy. 'The number of daily deaths is now in line with the levels in the Reasonable Worst Case and is almost certain to exceed this within the next two weeks.' They added: 'There is complete consensus in SPI-M-O that the current outlook for the epidemic's trajectory is concerning, if there are no widespread decisive interventions or behavioural changes in the near term.' The SAGE scientists did that if the number of new infections were to fall in the 'very near future' then the reasonable worst case scenario may 'only continue for three to four weeks.' However, they warned that if the 'R' rate were to remain above 1 then the epidemic 'will further diverge from the planning scenario.' The Government-funded REACT study at Imperial College London predicted that the R rate across all of England had climbed to 1.6 - the highest since the first lockdown. It added it could be as high as 2.8 in London. When the R rate is above 1, an outbreak can grow exponentially. An R of 1.8 would mean on average every 10 people infected will infect 28 other people. SAGE's latest official R rate estimates did claim the figure had dropped and estimated it stood between 1.1 and 1.3 both nationally and in London. Either way, there appears to be consensus that the infection rate remains above 1. The committee had called for the Government to follow the footsteps of Germany and France by retreating back into a full national shutdown 'for at least a month' because they the three-tiered system was failing. It comes as experts claimed the NHS could be overwhelmed 'within weeks' without drastic action to tackle the spread of Covid-19, in a repeat of warnings made to lock-down the country in March. Ministers fear that hospitals could fill up with rising coronavirus admissions. Without action to stem the tide of cases, it would be 'impossible' for the health service to cope in the coming weeks, academics . Sir Jeremy Farrar, director of the Wellcome Trust, : 'Doctors and scientists agree that none of the current restrictions have been enough to stop the virus spreading. 'Without a change, the NHS would have been overwhelmed within weeks and it would have been difficult if not impossible to cope in the winter months with the inevitable increase in caring for people with Covid as well as non-Covid illnesses. There's absolutely no doubt that many more of us would have seen loved ones die, suffer with long-term Covid symptoms or from other illnesses.' 'The only way to get things back to normal quickly is to get the virus under control as soon as possible.' Dr Shaun Fitzgerald, Royal Academy of Engineering visiting professor at the University of Cambridge, added: 'None of us want this at all. But it now seems there is no choice if we are to avoid letting thousands and thousands more die, and the health service swamped to an extent that even non-Covid patients are seriously affected.' Above are the Covid-19 infection rates in London boroughs for the week ending October 24, according to official data Almost 20 NHS trusts in England are already treating more coronavirus patients than at the peak of the first wave, according to official statistics that come amid warnings hospitals across the country could run out of beds before Christmas The Government's SAGE advisers released papers yesterday evening that showed how they warned ministers two weeks ago that Britain could be headed for a more serious situation than their 'worst case scenario' The news comes as the UK recorded more than one million lab-confirmed cases of coronavirus since the start of the outbreak, according to Government data. And hospitals are feeling the pressure as cases rise. There are now almost 11,000 people in hospitals across the UK - including 978 on ventilators. And many hospitals are treating more patients than they were at the height of the first wave of the pandemic. In September, the Government's chief scientific officer warned that the UK could be facing 50,000 new Covid-19 cases a day by mid-October, leading to 200 deaths a day a month later. But the Government a further 326 people had died within 28 days of testing positive for Covid-19 as of Saturday. Figures published by the UK's statistics agencies for deaths where Covid-19 has been mentioned on the death certificate, together with additional data on deaths that have occurred in recent days, show there have now been 62,000 deaths involving Covid-19 in the UK. After weeks insisting he is sticking to local restrictions, the Prime Minister completed a humiliating U-turn by announcing blanket coronavirus restrictions for England at a press conference after 6.30pm. The brutal squeeze will see non-essential shops in England shut until December 2, alongside bars and restaurants despite the 'absolutely devastating' impact on the already crippled hospitality sector. Households are banned from mixing indoors during the period, and travel within the UK heavily discouraged. However, unlike the March lockdown schools and universities are expected to remain open. The careful choreography of the announcement has been torn up after leaks overnight caused a storm, with Downing Street launching a hunt for the mole amid fresh evidence of Cabinet splits. Mr Johnson previously slapped down demands for a 'circuit-breaker' - a form of which has already been implemented in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland - instead extolling the virtues of his 'tiered' system. Data from King's College London's Covid Symptom Study app shows that coronavirus cases in the UK have soared to more than 40,000 per day after a lull in the summer but the team behind it maintain that they 'have not spiralled out of control'"", ""The British public has emerged from its enforced hibernation to push strict lockdown rules to their limit this weekend as the Government considers allowing friends and family to gather together in 'bubbles'. People are hitting the roads again today as new data shows traffic congestion has surged from the start of the month and since the lockdown was announced. Walking in London has picked up markedly in the last three days alone, according to Apple Map's most recent 'Covid-19 mobility trends' data. It appears there has been a sharp increase in human traffic as the number of people walking across the country rose by around 8 percentage points on April 23 from last Saturday. The number of people walking, driving, and using public transport networks in the UK took a nosedive in early March, as concern about the spreading coronavirus outside of China - believed to be the country of its origin - intensified and gripped the nation. It plummeted on March 24 - the day after Boris Johnson declared a 'stay-at-home' order. But newly released figures available on Apple Maps indicates the British public are growing restless of life under lockdown as many more take to the roads and the streets. Each weekend of April - between the 4th and the 18th - the number of people walking, driving, and 'transiting' steadily climbed, even as police forces across the country became tougher on rule-breakers. Data from sat nav makers TomTom and the AA suggest there has been an increase in car trips around the UK this month. There are more motorists in London, Brighton and Hove, Bristol, Manchester, and Reading out and about today than last week, according to TomTom. Meanwhile, pictures this morning showed busy scenes at B&Q stores and parks, as fears of the harm done to the economy have caused businesses able to practice social distancing to open their doors to customers. The new statistics emerge as former Chancellor Philip Hammond called on the Government to publish an exit strategy and restart the economy, urging MPs to face the 'reality' that the UK must get back to work. In a stark message this morning, he warned the economy 'will not survive' and the country could not afford to wait until a vaccine had become available before resuming more normal economic activity. With Boris Johnson expected to return to Downing Street next week after recuperating from the virus, Mr Hammond he hoped it would mark a 'clear step change' in the Government's response to the crisis. Priti Patel today issued a rallying cry for Britons to 'stay strong' as she admitted the country was 'not out of the woods' in its fight against coronavirus. In the daily address to the nation this evening, the Home Secretary it was not time to lift the lockdown as the country entered its fifth weekend with restrictions. She warned: 'Our instruction remains clear, people should stay at home, protect the NHS (National Health Service) and save lives. We know that people are frustrated but we are not out of danger. It is imperative that we continue to follow the rules.' On another day in the fight against coronavirus, as Britain's death tally steadily rises: Britain has announced a further 813 coronavirus victims , taking the total number of fatalities to 20,319; Key workers including frontline NHS staff have spoken of their frustration after places for a coronavirus test ran out within just an hour of the site opening today; The World Health Organisation there was currently 'no evidence' that people who have recovered from COVID-19 and have antibodies are protected from a second coronavirus infection; Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who was ill with the virus, is preparing to return to Downing Street on Monday; Chancellor Rishi Sunak is drawing up measures to enable businesses to reopen in a 'safe and practical way'; Councils agreed to reopen 340 parks and green spaces following Robert Jenrick's timely intervention; Care home bosses have blamed the sector's soaring death toll on government guidance telling hospitals to discharge elderly residents to free up beds; The NHS is launching a new campaign to make sure people seek urgent care during a medical emergency after visits to A&E dropped by almost 50 per cent this month; Labour is criticising the inclusion of Dominic Cummings in a secret group advising the Government on the coronavirus crisis amid concerns political appointees are breathing down the necks of scientists; Low cost airline Wizz Air it would restart some flights from London's Luton Airport on May 1 In the last four weeks, there has been an eight per cent increase in people out and about walking across the UK - breaching strict lockdown policy.

The Prime Minister has spent a fortnight at his country retreat, Chequers, after being hospitalised with coronavirus. Allies warned he is still suffering the 'debilitating' effects of the illness, which saw him spend three nights in intensive care. A source Mr Johnson was likely to remain 'part-time for some time', adding: 'It will be a while before he is working 14-hour days again.' Mr Johnson himself has made no public comment since he was discharged from St Thomas' in central London on April 12. After leaving hospital, Mr Johnson recorded a heartfelt tribute to the medics who cared for him – and revealed his condition had been so serious that 'things could have gone either way'. Downing Street has given little detail of the Prime Minister's condition in recent days, other than to his recovery is continuing. However, Health Secretary Matt Hancock yesterday that he had spoken to the Prime Minister on Thursday and found him in 'ebullient' form. Advertisement This comes as it was revealed today that ministers are looking at whether to relax the strict 'stay at home' advice to let small groups of households 'cluster' together. It would allow a 'bubble' of up to ten close family members to meet for meals, or enable friends to share childcare. It could also allow couples who do not live together to see each other. Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon she is also considering relaxing the lockdown rules. Chancellor Rishi Sunak has been looking at how to start allowing non-essential businesses to reopen in a 'safe and practical way', keeping coronavirus out of shared office spaces. McDonald's, British Steel and construction firm Persimmon were among the first companies to announce plans to reopen in May, as the daily number of new cases of coronavirus should be lower then than they are now. Mr Hammond told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme: 'The reality is that we have to start reopening the economy. But we have to do it living with Covid. We can't wait until a vaccine is developed, produced in sufficient quantity and rolled out across the population. The economy won't survive that long. 'But we are going to have to do it alongside the measures that are in place to protect the population from Covid. That's going to be a much more complex phase of this crisis than the initial acute phase. 'Locking everything down and keeping everything locked down is relatively straightforward. 'The challenge of how to carefully, progressively, methodically reopen protecting both health and jobs is much, much more challenging and calls for a really skilful political leadership.' He it was essential that businesses are told now what requirements they will have to fulfil when the time comes to reopen. 'If we are all going to have to wear face masks travelling on public transport, businesses need to know that now so that businesses that have the capacity to manufacture products like that can start planning to do so,' he explained. 'If restaurants, when they eventually reopen, are going to have to operate with many fewer tables, they need to start thinking about how they adapt their business model to be able to do that. 'At the moment, for too many businesses, they just don't know what the requirements imposed on them are going to look like and therefore what kind of preparations they need to make to think about reopening their businesses.' The easing of lockdown rules could allow people to socialise with up to 10 of their closest family and friends. Close family members could meet for meals, or enable friends to share childcare. It could also allow couples who do not live together to see each other. In an idea reminiscent of BT's 'Friends and Families' scheme, people would nominate a small list of those they want to be able to see, drawn from no more than one or two households. Those involved would then be able to meet for meals and other social activities. But neither group would be allowed to mingle with others outside the 'cluster'. Ministers are still grappling with how to enforce the new meeting system and prevent a free-for-all that could allow the coronavirus epidemic to take hold again. A Whitehall source : 'If we can find a way to allow a bit more flexibility without risking transmission of the disease running higher then we will do it.' Belgium and Scotland are also looking at the idea. Britons continue to flout lockdown rules by packing out parks across the UK as temperatures soar, in another sign that the country is seemingly no longer willing to comply with government instructions to stay indoors. In the last four weeks, there has been an eight per cent increase in people out and about walking across the UK - breaching strict lockdown policy. And a steady increase of traffic on the roads has added to the growing unease in Downing Street that the country is becoming restless under the restrictions to everyday life. Jack Cousens, head of roads policy for the AA : 'Many drivers are sticking to the Government advice and are only making essential journeys by car, however, this week traffic and breakdowns have crept up. 'We are concerned that some have got so bored with lockdown that they are seeking a change of scenery by getting in their car. Breakdowns are up around a fifth (20 per cent) this week and traffic is around 10 per cent higher than the beginning of the lockdown. 'We all need to adhere to the advice and stay at home. One crash can tie up the emergency services for hours and may also result in precious NHS hospital beds being taken. 'The message is still to stay home and help to save lives. Police forces have also reported some horrendous speeds too and we urge everyone to stick to the limit as a minority of drivers have been treating the roads as race tracks.'

Shadow Health Secretary Jonathan Ashworth told BBC Radio 4's Today programme today that Brexit architect Cummings should not be attending meetings. Mr Ashworth thundered: 'The concern is that political advisers have influenced the debate, the way to clear this up is for all the minutes to be published, we've called on the Government to do this. When you are dealing with an epidemic like this, you need to take the public with you every step'. Mr Cummings' name was on a leaked list of attendees of the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies' (SAGE) meetings as far back as February. The list, which was seen by The Guardian, showed Mr Cummings was at a SAGE meeting with 24 others on March 23, the day Prime Minister Boris Johnson addressed the public to announce heightened lockdown measures. Mr Cummings was joined by Ben Warner, a data scientist who worked alongside him on the Vote Leave Brexit campaign in 2016, other members of the group.

Health Secretary Matt Hancock yesterday warned the government would not ease lockdown restrictions until ministers were certain they could prevent a deadly second wave of infection. He this would not be possible until the number of cases was driven 'right down'. Mr Hancock he understood the 'economic pressures' the lockdown was causing, but warned they would be even worse if the UK suffered a second peak of the epidemic. He told BBC Radio Four's Today programme: 'I understand those voices who are saying we should move sooner but that is not something we are going to do.' Mr Hancock the lockdown could not be eased until ministers have the preliminary results of an Office for National Statistics study looking at how widespread the disease is in society. Downing Street it was 'conceivable' this could be ready ahead of the May 7 review of the lockdown. Former Tory leader Sir Iain Duncan Smith yesterday it was time for the government to 'bite the bullet' on the issue and set out a plan for easing the lockdown. 'The UK government now needs to recognise that the time is now,' he . Privately ministers are gloomy about the prospect of any significant easing of the lockdown on May 7, given the need to meet five tests that include a major reduction in the number of cases and security of supply of personal protective equipment. CORONAVIRUS TEST SLOTS RUN OUT FOR SECOND DAY Key workers have spoken of their frustration after places for a coronavirus test ran out within just an hour of the site opening today. Some 5,000 home kits and 19,000 drive-through tests were expected to be made available on Saturday - with key workers asked to fill out an online application form as the government races to hit its 100,000-a-day testing target by next Thursday. Many were trying to secure a test for the second time after the government's new website had to close hours after launching on Friday as 46,000 people tried to access it. But within twenty minutes of the website launching this morning, home test kits were no longer available and applicants could only select a drive-through test. And within an hour drive-through tests in England had also completely booked up. Ten million key workers and their households are now eligible for the tests. Frustrated key workers also struggled to secure one of the kits yesterday. Within two minutes of the website going live at 6am on Friday, all 5,000 tests for people to do at home had been booked. Meanwhile, more than 15,000 appointments for tests at drive-through centres were also taken quickly, forcing the Department of Health to apologise on Twitter 'for any inconvenience' and close applications. It comes as the government was forced to admit that no checks will be made on whether those requesting coronavirus tests are genuinely essential workers. Advertisement One insider : 'I don't think anyone thinks we are going to pass the five tests in the next week or two.' Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon she is considering relaxing the lockdown rules. She : 'I know from my own parents who are not seeing their grandkids just know, I understand the anguish of that. 'We're all missing seeing our loved ones so we all want to get beyond that as quickly as possible. 'Every country is going through these decisions, none of us are through this pandemic yet, but some countries are starting to look at slightly expanding what people would define as their household - encouraging people who live alone to maybe match up with somebody else who is on their own or a couple of other people to have almost kind of bubbles of people.' She added: 'And the key thing there is, if you're seeing maybe one or two more people outside your household, it's got to be the same people on a day-to-day, week-to-week basis so you're still limiting the ability for the virus to transmit. 'Now, none of these are fixed decisions yet, but these are all the kind of things we're trying to work through. 'What we're trying to do is to do is, how do we get a semblance of normality back into our lives because the lockdown - it is essential that people stick with it just now - but it's having consequences of its own.' Unseasonably warm weather has caused many Britons to defy ministers' instructions and head to parks, beaches and shopping centres in their droves. Unseasonably warm weather has caused many Britons to defy ministers' instructions and head to parks, beaches and shopping centres in their droves. This comes as fast-food giants KFC and Burger King, as well as high street coffee chain Pret, gradually reopen stores across the UK. In signs of a Government strategy shift, B&Q has been allowed to open 14 stores to trial new social distancing measures. Some B&Q stores have resumed trading after the DIY retailer carried out a trial reopening of 14 stores at the weekend, saying it was in a position to 'follow best practice' after seeing how other essential retailers have 'supported social distancing in their stores'. Police chiefs have repeatedly begged the nation to obey the rules, while one force yesterday branded those flouting the lockdown as 'selfish'. However their message has been undermined by their own officers failing to observe social distancing during Thursday's clap for carers on Westminster Bridge. Ms Patel will this afternoon use the daily Downing Street press briefing to impress upon the public the seriousness of following the rules. A source close to the Home Secretary told the Daily Express: 'We are seeing a worrying increase in people moving around. 'Some industries which we did not advise to close are reopening, and we welcome that provided the social distancing rules are observed. 'The vast majority of the public are still doing the right thing. However, transport use has ticked up in a way that suggests something more is going on and that has set off alarm bells.' The grim 20,000 milestone - which also saw the number of people testing positive for coronavirus rise by 4,913 to 148,377 - came as the coronavirus lockdown continued into its fifth weekend and the Government faced calls for greater transparency over the scientific advice given to ministers on the outbreak The total number of A&E attendances in March this year was significantly lower than the year before Britain's R0 IS below one: Chief medical officer reveals UK coronavirus sufferers are on average infecting less than one person in crucial milestone towards lifting lockdown Professor Chris Whitty has offered a chink of light out of the lockdown after revealing coronavirus infection rates have been wrestled down. England's chief medical officer the reproduction number - or R0 - has been brought below 1, marking a critical achievement in the UK's war on Covid-19. It means coronavirus sufferers are on average infecting less than one person, meaning the disease will wind up as it can no longer spread. Prof Whitty, who is part of the core team steering the government's response and has become a staple in the briefings, suggested an easing of restrictions could happen relatively soon. Speaking to MPs on the Science and Technology Select Committee, Prof Whitty : 'The R that we have at the moment is somewhere between 0.5 and 1. 'Let's for the sake of argument it is in the middle of that range, which I think is likely, that does give a little bit of scope for manoeuvre and ticking some things off while still keeping it below 1. 'But there are lots of ifs, buts and ands to that. Advertisement Ministers have come under pressure to publish a road map out of the lockdown, but have so far remained tight-lipped. The lack of information from Whitehall has jarred with the approach taken in Scotland by Nicola Sturgeon, who published a plan to ease restrictions after promising to treat the public 'like grown ups'. At yesterday's Downing Street press conference, Transport Secretary Grant Shapps praised the British people for largely following the rules. He : 'The country has done incredibly well in adhering to social distancing and there is a danger as we go into yet another warm sunny weekend that people think that perhaps these graphs are showing that the peak is over. 'It isn't over, we're riding perhaps, we hope, a downward trend but it is by no means, no means established yet. When people ask me when will the measures, the social distancing, the stay at home measures, be altered, my answer in some ways is that some of this lies in your own hands. 'The more we adhere to it and are strict about the social distancing that is required, the faster that decision will be able to be made. But that decision will, of course, be made entirely on the advice of science and medical advice.' Yet when the lockdown will end is still a focal point in the national conversation, and McDonald's yesterday mooted re-opening. The fast food giant, which is already operation again in coronavirus-stricken France, is in talks about opening its 1,249 restaurants across the UK, according to reports. The burger chain could open for drive-thru and delivery orders as early as mid-May, the Irish Farmers Journal. A spokesperson for McDonald's : 'Of course we are thinking about re-opening and having those conversations – but it's unclear when that will be.'

Millions of key workers miss out on coronavirus test for second day after 19,000 drive-in slots and 5,000 home kits run out within just one hour of site opening today By James Wood for MailOnline How do you arrange a coronavirus test? ARRANGING YOUR OWN Essential workers who are self-isolating can book a test directly here. You can select a regional test site drive-through appointment or home test kit. The Department of Health home test kit availability will initially be limited but more will become available. However, it there is good availability of regional test sites. Those who face problems on the website can call the service desk on 0300 303 2713, from 8am to 8pm. BEING REFERRED FOR ONE Another way essential workers can get tested is by being referred by their employer through a new portal, if they are already self-isolating. It is a secure portal for employers to use to upload the full list of names and contact details of self-isolating essential workers. If referred, essential workers will get a text message with a unique code to book a test for themselves or family members at a regional testing site. Advertisement Key workers have spoken of their frustration after places for a coronavirus test ran out within just an hour of the site opening today. Some 5,000 home kits and 19,000 drive-through tests were expected to be made available on Saturday - with key workers asked to fill out an online application form as the government races to hit its 100,000-a-day testing target by next Thursday. Many were trying to secure a test for the second time after the government's new website had to close hours after launching on Friday as 46,000 people tried to access it. But within twenty minutes of the website launching this morning, home test kits were no longer available and applicants could only select a drive-through test. And within an hour drive-through tests in England had also completely booked up. Ten million key workers and their households are now eligible for the tests. Frustrated key workers also struggled to secure one of the kits yesterday. Within two minutes of the website going live at 6am on Friday, all 5,000 tests for people to do at home had been booked. Meanwhile, more than 15,000 appointments for tests at drive-through centres were also taken quickly, forcing the Department of Health to apologise on Twitter 'for any inconvenience' and close applications. It comes as the government was forced to admit that no checks will be made on whether those requesting coronavirus tests are genuinely essential workers. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps apologised after the new government website was closed due to 'significant demand'. A medical worker sprays hand sanitiser on an essential worker at a drive-in testing facility for coronavirus, in east London today Home kits and regional tests were available on the government website on the government website at 8.10am today. But within twenty minutes of the website launching home testing kits were no longer available.

Four restaurants in London, two in Manchester and one in Dublin are firing up their grills again to make meals for NHS workers and local charities. The business it will provide up to 1,700 free meals each day for NHS staff, key workers at local hospitals and charities. KFC: KFC is reopening 11 of its restaurants, for delivery only, with staff volunteering to work. The restaurants are in Aldershot, Birmingham, Glasgow, Ipswich, London, Manchester, Portsmouth, Stockport, and Tamworth. Burger King: Burger King has reopened four restaurants across UK with a pared-down menu for delivery only. Staff will wear masks and gloves and will be trained to run delivery-only kitchens It will be also be donating 1,000 meals week to staff working at NHS hospitals. The fast food giant has reopened two in Bristol, one in Coventry, and one in Swindon. Despite only offering 30 per cent of the regular menu, the chain is already doing a roaring trade with one branch doing a week's worth of orders in just four days. B&Q: B&Q tried out a trial opening of 14 of its stores of the weekend saying it was in a position to follow 'best practice' after seeing how other essential retailers have implemented social distancing measures. Staff at the stores are wearing protective equipment such as visors and protective gloves. Pret A Manger: Pret announced last week that 10 stores would be reopening for a delivery and takeaway service, offering a reduced menu. 10 London branches will be open in order to support NHS workers. They will offer standard Pret food as well as essentials such as milk, bread and butter. The London Pret stores reopening are: Fulham Road, South Kensington, St George University, St John's Wood, Tooting Broadway, Kings Road, City Road, Great Portland Street and Vauxhall, St George's Wharf. Five Guys: The chain is to open an extra seven stores to the 13 that have remained open during Coronavirus crisis. The service is delivery and click and collect only. Stores that reopened over the last few days include: St Paul's, Baker Street, Edinburgh Fort Kinnaird, Edinburgh Fountain Park, Plymouth, Liverpool Queen Square and Guildford. Advertisement One man who successfully applied for a drive-in test minutes after the scheme opened told the Guardian 'any Tom, Dick or Harry' can get a test. A spokesman the government was relying on the public to be honest. 'As with many aspects of the coronavirus response, we would expect the public to respond in good faith and that is what they have done with other aspects of the scheme and I think we would expect it to be the same here,' he . Mr Shapps yesterday told the daily Downing Street coronavirus press conference that reports the website had crashed were not accurate and it was 'simply that the slots for today were taken up'. He insisted the government is confident every key worker who needs a test will soon be able to access one as ministers strive to hit a 100,000 daily tests target by the end of April. 'We know what the capacity is, we don't quite know how many people would want to be tested because many people working for the NHS for example will have already accessed those tests through their work places,' he . Ministers that UK testing capacity is currently at 51,000 a day - including tests within the NHS and care homes - and they are hoping to be able to provide 18,000 home test kits by the end of April. No 10 5,000 home kits - the total on offer - were ordered online this morning. Ministers expected another 15,000 tests to take place at drive-through sites today. Under the scheme, test results from the drive-through sites will be sent out by text within 48 hours, and within 72 hours of collection of the home delivery tests. Separately, key workers who are self-isolating can also now get tested by being referred by their employer through a new portal, which went live at midnight. The PM's spokesman : 'Within two minutes of the portal opening this morning, 5,000 testing kits had been ordered. And that's the available capacity for today.' Number 10 also the Government is trusting that those applying for tests are key workers, with no eligibility checks in place for online bookings. The spokesman : 'As with many other aspects of the coronavirus response, we would expect the public to respond in good faith. 'That is what they have done with other aspects of the scheme, I think we'd expect it to be the same here.' Get patients back into Britain's deserted hospitals: New figures show number of people visiting UK's A&E wards down by half this month Britain's National Medical Director of the National Health Service (NHS), Prof. Stephen Powis, holding a digital press conference on the ongoing pandemic of the COVID-19 disease Health officials are worried many people are not seeking treatment because they fear contracting Covid-19, thereby jeopardising their survival and potentially becoming collateral damage to the virus. Recent research found four in 10 people are too worried about being a burden on the NHS to seek help from their GP. NHS chief executive Sir Simon Stevens stressed the NHS is still there for non-Covid patients who might be suffering from a stroke, heart attack, and other killer conditions. It is predicted there will be one million fewer visits to A&E this April compared to 2.1 million visits recorded over the same period last year. NHS England's medical director, Professor Stephen Powis, today there were concerns about fewer people seeking medical help for non-coronavirus related issues. Asked if lives are being lost because people are not presenting themselves to doctors, he told BBC Breakfast: 'It would be true to we are concerned about that. 'Clearly we have seen the reduction in A&E attendances. If everybody is self-isolating, there may be less infections being transmitted other than Covid-19. 'What we absolutely want people to do is if you do have a condition, particularly an emergency that is not coronavirus, you should not be afraid of accessing healthcare services.' Senior clinicians from the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health and medical health charities such as the British Heart Foundation and Stroke Association are also worried. The new public health campaign will be rolled out from next week reminding people to contact their GP or call 111 if they need urgent care, and attend a hospital if they are told to do so. Those in an emergency must still call 999. It also calls upon Britons to use other vital services such as cancer screening and treatment, maternity appointments and mental health support as normal. Sir Simon : 'While NHS staff have pulled out all the stops to deal with coronavirus, they have also worked hard to ensure that patients who don't have Covid-19 can safely access essential services. 'Ignoring problems can have serious consequences - now or in the future.' Due to efforts to ramp up capacity in the face of the coronavirus threat, the NHS now has 33,000 urgent care beds at its disposal in traditional hospitals. The NHS has also overseen the construction of seven new Nightingale field hospitals around the country. The campaign will include information from doctors, nurses and patient groups to highlight how the health service has adapted to the pandemic to ensure safe access to all types of urgent care. Professor Carrie MacEwen, chair of the Academy of Medical Royal Colleges, : 'We are very concerned that patients may not be accessing the NHS for care because they either don't want to be a burden or because they are fearful about catching the virus. 'Everyone should know that the NHS is still open for business and it is vitally important that if people have serious conditions or concerns they seek help.' The British Heart Foundation has reported a 50% fall in the number of people attending A&E with heart attacks, thereby risking their survival. Earlier this week, Cancer Research UK warned 2,250 new cases of the disease could be going undetected each week - partly down to patients' reluctance to go and see their GP. Health Secretary Matt Hancock has voiced his concern in the House of Commons on Wednesday. Advertisement Back to work in mid-May? Ministers quietly advise businesses how to get back to work in a few weeks time including creating 'COVID-secure offices' with closed communal areas No evidence that recovered covid patients can't be re-infected The World Health Organization (WHO) on Saturday that there was currently 'no evidence' that people who have recovered from COVID-19 and have antibodies are protected from a second coronavirus infection. In a statement, the United Nations agency warned against issuing 'immunity passports' or 'risk-free certificates' to people who have been infected, saying the practice may actually increase the risk of spread as they may ignore standard advice. Until now the antibody tests had been considered the key to letting countries out of lockdown, allowing officials to get a clearer picture of the true size of the coronavirus outbreak. The UK has carried out fewer than 5,000 antibody tests so far - despite mass schemes being carried out across the globe. Antibodies are proteins in the blood which reveal if someone has already fought off an infection, including the deadly coronavirus. A statement from the World Health Organisation explained that while most people appear to have produced antibodies to the Covid-19 virus in their recovery, it is not known if the presence of these antibodies in the blood is enough to stop a second infection. The organisation also notes that the antibody tests may 'falsely catagorize people in two ways', labelling people who have been infected as negative and those who have not as positive - leading to potentially deadly results. Advertisement The Treasury is planning to 'get Britain back to work' in a matter of weeks with new health and safety rules to be enforced in offices, it has been reported. Chancellor Rishi Sunak has been looking at how to start allowing non-essential businesses to reopen in a 'safe and practical way', keeping coronavirus out of shared office spaces. McDonald's, British Steel and construction firm Persimmon were among the first high-profile companies to announce their intention to reopen in May, as the daily number of new cases of coronavirus should be in the low thousands by then. Robert Jenrick, the Housing Secretary, Persimmon's decision to reopen sites was 'another big step forward for housing and construction'. Car manufacturers Nissan, Aston Martin and Jaguar Land Rover have also they will reopen their factories with strict safety measures in place following talks with the Government. Government rules being drafted at the moment are believed to include forcing businesses to put up social distancing notices, close communal space and supply hand sanitising products. If staff show any symptoms of coronavirus then they should to be told to go home. Manufacturers BMW, Toyota, JCB and Caterpillar have also been involved in Government talks, with officials suggesting workers wear perspex shields on production lines as their own form of personal protective equipment. It comes amid claims businesses are being advised by ministers on how to get employees back to work, as it is believed some firms reacted too strongly to the lockdown restrictions imposed in March. There is growing concern over the extent of the economic impact of the lockdown if companies are not allowed to return in the next weeks. UK retail sales fell by the most on record in March, according to Office for National Statistics figures. Clothing sales saw the biggest slump of over a third, and overall sales volumes plunged by 5.1 per cent in March from February. A Downing Street source : 'If people are within the rules and follow social distancing guidance, we are more than happy for businesses to resume on that basis.' Chancellor Rishi Sunak has been looking at a way to start allowing non-essential businesses to reopen in a 'safe and practical way', keeping coronavirus out of shared office spaces Care homes bosses blame climbing death toll on 'reckless stiff broom' policy to send back hundreds of elderly coronavirus patients to free up hospital beds By Amie Gordon for MailOnline Care home bosses have blamed the sector's soaring death toll on government guidance telling hospitals to discharge elderly residents to free up beds. The chilling warning came in the wake of a government document which advises hospitals, 'to free up NHS capacity via rapid discharge into the community and reducing planned care.' The plan, drafted on March 17, told NHS hospitals that 'timely discharge' was important - and told care homes to accept patients who had not even been tested for coronavirus. It has since been updated saying the policy 'will move' to patients being tested prior to admission to care homes. But residents coming from their own homes do not have to be tested prior to admission. The devastating impact on the elderly has been laid bare in recent days, after Care England estimated the number of Covid-19 deaths in care homes reached 7,500 a week ago. Questions continue to emerge over the true number of Britons dying in care homes after figures from Northern Ireland yesterday showed a third of all fatalities were elderly residents. Britain announced a further 813 coronavirus victims today, taking the total number of fatalities in the UK to 20,319. Pitkerro Care Centre in Dundee (pictured) confirmed the fatalities after a former care worker revealed she had resigned in 'disgust' at the conditions she was forced to work under THIRD OF COVID-19 DEATHS IN NORTHERN IRELAND ARE IN CARE HOMES... SO WHAT IS THE TRUE NUMBER OF FATALITIES IN THE UK? More questions emerged over the true number of Britons dying in care homes today after figures from Northern Ireland showed a third of all fatalities were elderly residents. The latest weekly update from the Northern Ireland Statistical and Research Agency (NISRA) records 276 deaths involving Covid-19 up to April 17. Of these, 60.1 per cent occurred in hospitals, 33.7 per cent in care homes, 5.1 per cent at private addresses and 1.1 per cent at hospices. The 96 deaths in care homes and hospices involved 44 separate establishments. The NISRA figures are higher than the number of deaths reported daily by the Public Health Agency (PHA), which by April 17 had reached 212. The PHA figures are based on patients who had previously tested positive for the virus, whereas NISRA figures are based on the information entered on death certificates, filled out by medical professionals. Comparatively the total number of total deaths registered in Northern Ireland in the week ending April 17 was 424. The figure is 11 fewer than the previous week but 134 more than the five year average of 290. Data from England and Wales has suggested the true number of deaths outside hospitals – which are the only ones recorded by the Department of Health – is around 15 per cent. But figures from Scotland show the rate is around 40 per cent, which could mean the UK's true death toll from COVID-19 is more than 27,000. Advertisement The Office for National Statistics (ONS) on Tuesday 1,000 people died in care homes in the week to 10 April. The Care Quality Commission (CQC), which regulates care homes in England, has produced preliminary data for April 11-15, suggesting there were a further 1,000 deaths linked to Covid-19. They also there may be a significant increase. New figures are expected to be published on April 28, once they have been verified. The Adult and Social Care Action Plan adds: 'Timely discharge is important for individuals so they can recuperate in a setting appropriate for rehabilitation and recovery – and the NHS also needs to discharge people in order to maintain capacity for acutely ill patients.' It was subsequently updated with the following guidance: 'We can now confirm we will move to institute a policy of testing all residents prior to admission to care homes. 'This will begin with all those being discharged from hospital.' But it people coming from their own homes will not yet be tested prior to admission; 'For individuals coming from the community, we will move to these residents being tested prior to admission. 'The majority will have come from isolation in their own homes given social distancing and shielding policies. 'After discussion with the new resident and family, the care home may wish to isolate the new resident for a 14-day period following admission.' A Whitehall source told the Telegraph that the policy was 'designed as a 'stiff broom' to free up capacity in hospitals.' Dr Jamie Wilson, founder of Hometouch, which provides care to people in their own homes, told the Telegraph: 'I'm astonished at the lack of foresight of these policies. 'To mandate that care homes should take back Covid-positive patients with such a high risk of cross infection and high mortality rate in vulnerable residents seems unfathomable.' This comes as it was revealed ministers are looking at whether to relax the strict 'stay at home' advice to let small groups of households 'cluster' together. A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson : 'Social care is on the frontline of our fight against coronavirus and the safety of staff and residents is our top priority. 'All care home residents discharged from hospital will be tested before being admitted into their care home. For those who have tested positive, care homes should follow guidance on effective isolation strategies or cohorting and where this isn't possible alternative accommodation should be found through local authorities for the remainder of their isolation period. 'To further help control the spread of the virus within social care we have also strengthened our advice around isolation for asymptomatic residents discharged into care homes and are using our increased testing capacity to test all symptomatic care home residents, care staff, and their families.' Cabinet ministers were warned last year to stockpile PPE for a coronavirus pandemic, told it could come in three waves, kill 65,000 people and cost £2.35TRILLION By Jack Elsom for MailOnline The National Security Risk Assessment predicted tens of thousands of deaths and spiralling economic costs Foreboding the current coronavirus crisis, it recommended stockpiling personal protective equipment The 600-page report will further fuel accusations the government was caught flat-footed by the virus Ministers were last year warned of the grave consequences a future pandemic would unleash on the UK, a leaked Cabinet Office briefing had revealed. Tens of thousands of deaths, crippling economic costs and creaking public services were predicted in the 2019 National Security Risk Assessment which mapped out how an outbreak would likely unfold. Almost foreboding the current coronavirus crisis, it recommended stockpiling personal protective equipment and drawing up plans to repatriate stranded Britons abroad. The government was also told to shore up the infrastructure needed to conduct mass contact tracing, in a revelation that will pour petrol on the simmering row over the lack of testing. The 600-page report, which was leaked to the Guardian, will further fuel accusations the government was caught flat-footed by the health emergency because of a lack of long-term planning. Chief scientific officer Sir Patrick Vallance, one of the key figures steering the Covid-19 response, signed off the report last year and impressed the need for 'robust' plans to deal with a pandemic. The assessment a relatively mild outbreak of 'moderate virulence' could lead to 65,600 deaths and could cost the UK £2.35trillion. It is not clear if Boris Johnson was prime minister when the report was written, or whether it was given to ministers serving the previous administration under Theresa May. Labour last night asked why the government had not acted on the advice of the report and demanded ministers explain themselves. Ministers were warned last year that the Government needed robust plans in place to deal with a potential pandemic virus, according to a leaked Cabinet Office briefing which was signed off by chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance (pictured at Downing Street press briefing) The document, marked 'official, sensitive', wargamed potential scenarios the government would have to respond to, depending on the severity of the virus Chief medical officer explains decision to abandon mass testing England's chief medical officer has told how contact tracing was abandoned in the UK as coronavirus spread as the thinking was it 'wasn't likely to add a huge amount at that particular point, given the resources we had'. Speaking to MPs on the Science and Technology Committee, Professor Chris Whitty the UK tried to initially contain the virus, as did other countries, but when it moved to a global pandemic, the thinking changed. Prof Whitty explained how the nature of Covid-19, with some people not displaying symptoms, made containing the virus difficult and it was spreading at speed. He : 'Initially, the policy was 'let's see if we can contain this' and every country in the world took different versions of this but broadly that's what we were doing. 'Once this became clearly a global pandemic...it was really going to come in, coming from multiple sources... 'At that point, a combination of where the epidemic was in the UK, where the epidemic was in Europe, and our own capacity meant that trying to do this, and deploy all our resources to try to do this with the ratio of people who would be followed up where you couldn't We'll start off with where you come from geographically'... 'We're going to have to do this on syndrome, with a very non-specific syndrome...(and) this is a very different disease spreading at phenomenal speed, doubling every three to four days at this stage, my technical view and our technical view collectively was it really wasn't likely to add a huge amount at that particular point, given the resources we had.' Advertisement As the country continues to weather the social and economic effects of the virus, the leaked report revealed: Half the population would exhibit symptoms of the virus, while even more would be infected yet be asymptomatic; The pandemic would unfold over three waves, with each wave lasting roughly 15 weeks; Once the pandemic eventually passed, the hit to public services would take years to repair; eventually passed, the hit to public services would take years to repair; A huge public backlash would skewer a government who were deemed to have bungled the crisis response. Labour's Shadow cabinet office minister Rachel Reeves : 'The revelations in this report are alarming and raise serious questions about the Government's preparedness for a pandemic. 'Michael Gove must make a statement to Parliament on Monday explaining why its recommendations were not implemented.' The document, marked 'official, sensitive', wargamed the potential risks posed by a pandemic and made recommendations to bolster Britain's ability to fight it. An 'influenza pandemic', which is the closest to the coronavirus outbreak, was judged to pose a 'very high' risk. One of the recommendations made by Sir Patrick was to ensure a system of 'disease surveillance and early detection' - essentially the infrastructure needed for testing and contact tracing - was in place. But a common criticism levelled at the government is that it downplayed the need for mass testing despite it proving a successful strategy in other countries to suppress the number of cases. Health Secretary Matt Hancock is now trying to ratchet up capacity with the target of carrying out 100,000 tests a day by the end of April. The NSRA also warned a pandemic would heap strain on vital public services which would be overwhelmed in the surge in cases. It : 'Critical infrastructure may also be affected during peak periods. There would be a huge surge in demand for health and social care services. 'Besides very severe levels of stress on the NHS, the level of excess deaths would stretch capacity within organisations involved in the management of deaths. 'This would be felt on a national scale, with local capacity likely to start to be overwhelmed during the peak of the pandemic.' Transport services, energy suppliers, the food industry, education and the finance sector would all be disrupted, the report warned. NSRA recommendations included stockpiling personal protective equipment (medics wearing PPE at a coronavirus testing site) The Cabinet Office declined to comment on the report. A spokesman : 'We do not comment on leaks.' According to the Guardian, the NSRA recommendations included stockpiling personal protective equipment, setting up advance purchase agreements for other essential kit and thrashing out a blueprint to manage a surge in deaths. The need for plans to help British nationals abroad and repatriate them to the UK was also to have been raised as a priority. The NSRA looked at both the the risk of a viral flu pandemic and also a coronavirus outbreak - both Sars and Mers were coronaviruses - although this was considered less damaging. The document included a series of 'reasonable worst case scenarios' for the spread of a flu-like viral pandemic. It suggested it would play out in three waves - each expected to last 15 weeks and with the peak occurring in weeks six and seven of each wave. Half of the population would be infected and experience symptoms of the disease during one or move of the waves. While the actual numbers infected would be higher as some cases would be asymptomatic, a pandemic of 'moderate virulence' could lead to 65,600 deaths. The document also spelled out the economic hits landed by the virus, and forecast costs could run to £2.35trillion. Chancellor Rishi Sunak has already delved deep into the Treasury coffers to fund £320billion in rescue loans, with the costs of shuttered business in lockdown also likely to contract the economy. Even after the pandemic was over, it that it could take months or even years for health and social care services to recover. Labour fury at Dominic Cummings' role in secretive SAGE group advising government as shadow health secretary controversial adviser must not be allowed to influence coronavirus debate By Emer Scully for Mailonline and Jason Groves for the Daily Mail Labour is criticising the inclusion of Boris Johnson's chief adviser Dominic Cummings in the secret group advising the Government on the coronavirus crisis amid concerns political appointees are breathing down the necks of scientists. Shadow Health Secretary Jonathan Ashworth told BBC Radio 4's Today programme today that Brexit architect Cummings should not be attending meetings. Mr Ashworth thundered: 'The concern is that political advisers have influenced the debate, the way to clear this up is for all the minutes to be published, we've called on the Government to do this. When you are dealing with an epidemic like this, you need to take the public with you every step'. Mr Cummings' name was on a leaked list of attendees of the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies' (SAGE) meetings as far back as February. The list, which was seen by The Guardian, showed Mr Cummings was at a SAGE meeting with 24 others on March 23, the day Prime Minister Boris Johnson addressed the public to announce heightened lockdown measures. Mr Cummings was joined by Ben Warner, a data scientist who worked alongside him on the Vote Leave Brexit campaign in 2016, other members of the group. Dominic Cummings' (pictured at Downing Street yesterday) is part of the secretive SAGE group advising the government on its coronavirus response However, Prof Stephen Powis, the National Medical Director of NHS England and a member of SAGE, described SAGE as a 'forum for scientific discussion' immune from political influence on Radio 4's Today programme. He : 'My experience of Sage is that it is a forum for scientific discussion. 'It is the experts from a variety of backgrounds who discuss the evidence, they discuss the evidence base of the various topics, they come to conclusions around that evidence base. It is then, of course, the role of Sage to advise the Government. 'I have been confident that what happens at Sage is a scientific discussion involving the scientists and the experts who are members of Sage. 'Very familiar territory for me - the sort of scientific discussion I have been very, very used to in my career as a doctor and a scientist. 'A thorough scientific discussion amongst the experts.' Labour's Shadow Health Secretary Jonathan Ashworth (left) has demanded that Dominic Cummings and Ben Warner (right) should not be sitting on SAGE Chief Medical Officer Chris Whitty he and Sir Patrick Vallance think membership of secretive Sage committee of government's science advisers SHOULD be made public England's Chief Medical Officer Chris Whitty backed naming the experts who are advising ministers on coronavirus - but they have been told they cannot be identified on security grounbds. Professor Whitty neither he nor Sir Patrick Vallance objected 'in principle' to the members of the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (SAGE) being common knowledge. But appearing in front of MPs yesterday afternoon he they had been told it could not happen for security reasons. It came amid a secrecy row after Sir Patrick, the Chief Scientific Adviser, told MPs last week that the identity of other members of the committee would not be revealed until after the pandemic is over. SAGE meets regularly with membership from across a range of expert fields and its findings are fed into Cobra briefings for ministers. Appearing remotely in front of the Science and Technology Committee this afternoon, Prof Whitty : 'Neither of us have any problem in principle with the names being made public, many people talk about their own work on Sage perfectly legitimately. 'I'm on SAGE, he's (Sir Patrick) on SAGE, all of this is perfectly open. 'But we were given quite clear advice from the CPNI (Centre for the Protection of National Infrastructure) basically based on the fact that Sage is a sub-committee of Cobra and meets under a range of circumstances, some of which are very security related - this is not. 'The principle needed to be thought through quite carefully. Absolutely no barrier though from me or from Sir Patrick in principle.' He added: 'The idea that it's secret I think is rather strong. I think it's not published, I suspect most members are actually known one way or another and all of the sub-committees are extremely open.' MPs last week called for the cast list of the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (SAGE) to be made public so that people can see exactly who ministers are getting their advice from. The government has rejected the calls, with sources claiming the names cannot be published because of security concerns amid reports of some experts receiving death threats. But former SAGE members have questioned that argument, insisting it is 'perfectly reasonable' for people to know who sits on the committee which Boris Johnson is relying on to guide the government's response to the outbreak. But in a letter to the same committee, Sir Patrick confirmed there were no plans to reveal the identities of the other SAGE members. 'Once SAGE stops convening on this emergency the minutes of relevant SAGE meetings, supporting documents and the names of participants (with their permission) will be published,' he . Advertisement The Government's former chief scientific adviser Sir David King told The Guardian political advisers were never on the equivalent committees of SAGE when he chaired them. While both membership of SAGE and what is discussed during regular meetings has been kept a closely guarded secret, the news sheds uncertainty on the reliability of decisions that have been made. Sir David he was 'shocked' to discover there were political advisers on SAGE. He added that it was 'critically important' scientific advice was free from political influence. Sir David Lidington, who served as Theresa May's deputy, also suggested the practice was unusual. He : 'I'm not aware of any minister or special adviser, certainly not in Theresa May's time, ever having been involved in the scientific advisory panels.' In a letter to MPs this month, Sir Patrick Vallance, the Government's chief scientific adviser, who chairs SAGE, membership was kept secret on advice from the Centre for the Protection of National Infrastructure. 'This contributes towards safeguarding individual members' personal security and protects them from lobbying and other forms of unwanted influence which may hinder their ability to give impartial advice,' he added. Chief medical officer Professor Chris Whitty, who co-chairs SAGE, has signalled a change in direction, telling MPs that he and Sir Patrick did not oppose publishing the membership. Asked if revealing members' names would boost public confidence in the scientific advice being given, he replied: 'Yes.' The revelation about Mr Cummings's participation in the group will add to concerns surrounding decisions by SAGE, which has not published any minutes from its last 19 meetings on the pandemic. Former members of SAGE were outraged a political fixer was on the committee, as others feared Mr Cummings could have twisted any advice offered during the meetings. A Government spokesman told MailOnline: 'Expert participants often vary for each meeting according to which expertise is required. 'A number of representatives from government departments and No 10 attend also.' Downing Street has Mr Cummings has attended meetings of SAGE but denied that he was a member. In a statement, a No 10 spokesman : 'It is not true that Mr Cummings or Dr Warner are 'on' or members of Sage. 'Mr Cummings and Dr Warner have attended some Sage meetings and listen to some meetings now they are all virtual. 'They do this in order to understand better the scientific debates concerning this emergency and also to understand better the limits of how science and data can help government decisions. 'Occasionally they ask questions or offer help when scientists mention problems in Whitehall. 'Sage provides independent scientific advice to the government. Political advisers have no role in this.' It comes just days after Sir Patrick Vallance, the Goverment's chief scientific adviser and chairman of SAGE, revealed they will not publish key evidence until after the pandemic ends. SAGE's advice to the Government has faced fresh scrutiny over a lack of widespread early testing and resistance to the idea of widespread facemask-use. In a letter to the Commons' Science Committee, Sir Patrick SAGE met 20 times before the start of April to discuss Covid-19. 'Sage will commit to informing the Committee in advance when new evidence is due to be published,' he . 'Once Sage stops convening on this emergency the minutes of relevant Sage meetings, supporting documents and the names of participants (with their permission) will be published.' But MPs criticised the secrecy. Senior Liberal Democrat Layla Moran : 'It is incredibly disappointing to hear that the Sage evidence guiding the Government will remain secret. 'Only by publishing this evidence can ministers be scrutinised and held to account on their decisions. 'The tone and quality of the debate improved dramatically following the publication of the Imperial College modelling, on which decisions were being made. 'I'm calling on the Government to think again.' MPs last week called for the cast list of SAGE to be made public so that people can see exactly who ministers are getting their advice from. The government has rejected the calls, with sources claiming the names cannot be published because of security concerns amid reports of some experts receiving death threats. But former SAGE members have questioned that argument, insisting it is 'perfectly reasonable' for people to know who sits on the committee which Mr Johnson is relying on to guide the government's response to the outbreak. However in his letter to committee chairman Greg Clark, Sir Patrick : 'The decision to not disclose SAGE membership for the time being is based upon advice from the Centre for the Protection of National Infrastructure and is in line with the standard procedure for COBR meetings, to which SAGE gives advice. 'This contributes towards safeguarding individual members personal security and protects them from lobbying and other forms of unwanted influence which may hinder their ability to give impartial advice.'Of course, we do not stop individuals from revealing that they have attended SAGE.'"", ""Airlines 'urgently' need government help to survive prolonged coronavirus curbs, industry bosses have warned, after Boris Johnson last night closed all travel corridors. The Prime Minister declared that all arrivals to the UK will have to have tested negative for coronavirus from Monday as he begged Britons to 'stay at home this weekend'. At a Downing Street briefing, the PM warned it was 'not the time to relax' as he escalated controls at the country's borders again. Amid fears over new mutant strains of the disease, he that all travel corridors will be suspended next week and anyone coming to the UK must have proof of a negative test in the previous 72 hours. Even then people will still have to isolate for 10 days - or five if they have another negative result during that period. The new regime will be backed by tougher spot checks and will stay in place until at least February 15 as ministers and scientists work out how to manage the threat posed by mutations of the virus. It makes up a 'strong package of measures to protect the public', aviation minister Robert Courts today, amid fears a dangerous Brazilian variant of the virus may already be in the UK. However, Abta, a trade association of travel agents and tour operators, the government should provide support 'as a matter of urgency' for the jobs and businesses at risk, while the British Airline Pilots' Association warned the industry would 'not be there to support the post Covid-19 recovery' without 'a clear plan of action and a proper package of support'. There were also fears from some travel bosses that rarely-used airports might have to be mothballed or given aid to save costs. A passenger arrives at Heathrow Airport in London ahead of the closure of Britain's travel corridors with the rest of the world Amid fears over new mutant strains of the disease, anyone coming to the UK must have proof of a negative test in the previous 72 hours Tim Alderslade, chief executive of trade body Airlines UK, warns the current situation 'is just not sustainable' Tim Alderslade, chief executive of trade body Airlines UK, told BBC Radio Four's Today programme: 'What we're saying to the government is clearly this is a national health emergency and ministers need to act to keep the public protected, that's absolutely right. 'But what we need is a road map out of this, so when the time is right we can remove these restrictions when it's safe to do so and start to look ahead to the spring and summer. 'Easter is the date we've got in mind as to when we can have an aviation sector again because if we don't start to bring in revenue to the sector, we're going to be in a very difficult place indeed. 'We've now had pretty much 12 months without any revenue coming in which is just not sustainable and airlines are effectively staying in business by taking on billions of pounds of debt which will need to be paid back. 'The government did give a period of grace before the introduction for pre-departure testing which was supposed to come into effect yesterday but has been pushed back to 4am on Monday to allow a few days to get these flights back home. 'But in terms of the volume of flights airlines are operating we're talking about less than 10% based on where we would normally be and in terms of long haul flying for places like South America where there are flights a huge number of those are freight only. 'Cargo has been the saving grace for the sector over the last 10 months so a number of airlines have increased the number of cargo flights to bring in some much-needed revenue to the sector.' Mr Courts the latest steps had been taken to prevent the variants from arriving and spreading in the UK. 'When you combine the pre-departure testing we have going live on Monday, the passenger locator form, the quarantine for 10 days and the stepping up of enforcement, we have a strong package of measures in place here to protect the public,' he . 'There has been a very robust enforcement process thus far. Border Force have conducted about three million spot checks, that's about 25% of all the people who've come into the UK and PHE have been conducting checks on top of that as well. 'We're making sure everybody understands why this is so important, it's a public health measure. It's an offence not to fill it in, it's an offence to fill it in incorrectly and I'm confident people by and large understand why we're doing this. 'We're stepping up enforcement both at the border and in the country and making sure people realise there are substantial fines they face if they don't comply of £500 and upwards. 'Borders are not closed except for some examples such as South Africa and South America, what this is is a suspension of the travel corridor programme which allowed people to travel without having to self-isolate. 'That was fine back when we were assessing the public health risk from the original virus, we've reached the position now where the Joint Biosecurity Centre can't give live scientific updates to predict which countries or regions may originate new variants.' Meanwhile, the shadow home secretary has warned the Government to act in a 'proper, strategic way' in its closure of all travel corridors on Monday. Labour's Nick Thomas-Symonds told the BBC: 'The measures are necessary, I support them coming into effect. 'I do to the Government to get a comprehensive plan and to act in a proper, strategic way, not in the short-term chaotic way we've seen over the past twelve months.' He added: 'First of all it is about checking before people board airplanes and then checks on arrival. 'But to make this whole system work we have to have an effective quarantine system, and that's been a real problem.' A total of 3,514,385 Covid-19 vaccinations had taken place in England between December 8 and January 15, according to provisional NHS England data, including first and second doses, which is a rise of 324,711 on Friday's figures. Of this number, 3,090,058 were the first dose of the vaccine, a rise of 320,894 on Friday's figures, while 424,327 were the second dose, an increase of 3,817. 'It's precisely because we have the hope of that vaccine and the risk of new strains coming from overseas that we must take additional steps now to stop those strains from entering the country,' Mr Johnson last night. As the UK recorded 55,761 new cases - down a fifth on last Friday - the PM appealed for the public not to weaken, as he called on everyone to 'think twice' before leaving the house. 'This is not the time for the slightest relaxation of our national resolve and our individual efforts. So please stay at home, please protect the NHS and save lives,' he . The grim message came as the Covid death toll went up by another 1,280, although that was also slightly down on the same time last week. Experts believe the daily fatality toll won't peak until next week because of the three-week lag between getting infected and becoming severely ill. At a Downing Street briefing tonight, Boris Johnson warned it was 'not the time to relax' as he escalated controls at the country's borders again SAGE today published its weekly estimates of the R rate across the country and the rate of spread appears to be coming down in regions that have been in lockdown since they were put in Tier 4 in December - London, the East and the South East On another tumultuous day in the pandemic: One of the Covid variants detected in Brazil is already in the UK, a government scientist has revealed; All flights from Portugal and South America were finally banned amid fears over a mutant strain; A leading statistics expert has cases peaked 'a good few days ago' and deaths should start to level off in a week to 10 days; The UK in on track for another recession after GDP tumbled by 2.6 per cent in November as the second coronavirus lockdown hammered the economy; Tory MPs have voiced concerns over the 'very low' vaccine rollout in London which lags behind most of England – despite having the highest levels of infection; Fears have been voiced about the supply of goods crossing the border amid claims France wants lorry drivers to take PCR tests, which can take three days to give results, rather than rapid lateral flow versions; Ministers have unveiled a controversial new government advertising campaign warning meeting someone for a coffee could 'cost a life'; A total of 4.46million people were waiting to start hospital treatment in England at the end of November, the highest since records began; A report claimed Covid had caused the largest fall in Britain's population since the Second World War. Above is the case rates by age groups in the UK. The highest levels are in the 20-29 and 30-39 age groups, data from the ZOE Covid-19 study shows Boris Johnson speaks with the CEO of Pfizer, Albert Bourle and his team by video link in Downing Street yesterday The latest PHE surveillance update shows an improvement in the outbreak in the week up to January 10 Sunak warns of 'harder' times to come with UK on track for double-dip recession despite GDP only falling 2.6 per cent during coronavirus lockdown in November Rishi Sunak today warned things will 'get harder before they get better' as figures showed the UK is on track for another recession, with GDP tumbling by 2.6 per cent amid the second Covid lockdown in November. Restrictions in force in all four UK nations sparked another slump in activity after six months of improvement following the emergence of the disease. The impact was far more limited than many analysts feared as firms managed to find ways of working around the curbs. But it means the economy was still 8.5 per cent smaller in November than in February. Business groups warned that any December rally will have been smothered by the harsh 'tier' controls in England, and a double-dip recession now looks 'inevitable' with the new even tougher draconian to tackle mutant Covid. Mr Sunak it was 'clear things will get harder before they get better and today's figures highlight the scale of the challenge we face'. However, he the vaccine drive offered hope for recovery, and the Treasury was ready to support people hit by the crisis. Advertisement Earlier, Transport Secretary Grant Shapps defended the timing of the South America border ban amid complaints ministers have been 'behind the curve' responding to the threat of new Covid variants. The ban, also covers the Central American state of Panama and Portugal – due to its strong travel links with Brazil – and the former Portuguese colony of Cape Verde. It applies to everyone who has been in the area over the past 10 days - although UK and Irish nationals are exempt - and came into force at 4am. Scientists analysing the Brazilian variant believe the mutations it shares with the new South African strain are associated with a rapid increase in cases in locations where there have already been large outbreaks of the disease. British and Irish nationals and others with residence rights are exempted from the measures that were backed by the Scottish and Welsh governments, though they must self-isolate for 10 days along with their households on their return. Mr Shapps described the ban as a 'precautionary' measure to ensure the vaccination programme rolling out across the UK was not disrupted by new variants of the virus. Asked if the Brazilian strain was currently in the country, he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: 'Not as far as we are aware, I think, at this stage. 'There haven't been any flights that I can see from the last week from Brazil, for example.' Dr Mike Tildesley, an epidemiologist who advises the Government on its scientific pandemic influenza group on modelling group, the UK was late in imposing the travel ban but that it should minimise the risk from the 'more transmissible' variant. 'We always have this issue with travel bans of course, that we're always a little bit behind the curve,' he told BBC Breakfast. Hopes the peak of the second wave has finally passed have grown after a raft of official data and scientific estimates offered the strongest evidence yet that restrictions are tackling the mutant strain. SAGE today that the R number is between 1.2 and 1.3 - down from 1.4 last week - and the growth rate was between 2 per cent and 5 per cent a day. However, the group stressed that the data represent the average situation over the past few weeks, rather than the present state of play, with daily cases steadily falling. Cambridge University researchers have they believe R is below 1 in the East of England, London, the South East, West Midlands and Yorkshire and the Humber. Public Health England revealed yesterday that weekly Covid cases fell in every age group except the over-80s, while Department of Health figures showed dozens of boroughs saw a drop in infection rates. Mr Johnson has shelved the idea of toughening lockdown for now, after days of swirling rumours that non-essential click and collect and exercising with a friend could be banned in England. But despite the optimism over the vaccine rollout there are still huge challenges, with new figures today showing the economy is on track for a double-dip recession. GDP was down 2.6 per cent during the looser national lockdown in November. Tory MPs in London and mayor Sadiq Khan are also angry that the capital seems to be lagging behind in the vaccine drive. Nearly one in 20 Britons have now had a coronavirus vaccine - 3.5million people - with almost 45 per cent of over-80s now having had the jab Boris Johnson revealed that nearly one in 20 people in the UK has now received a coronavirus vaccine. The Prime Minister told a Downing Street press conference that some 3.3million people across the nation have now had a jab, before this figure rose to 3.5million on Saturday. That includes approximately 1.3million people who are over the age of 80 - almost 45 per cent of that group. Meanwhile, more than 100,000 older care home residents have been given the vaccine which is almost 40 per cent of the total. Mr Johnson praised the speed of the UK's vaccine roll-out as he the Government is 'steadily protecting those most at risk'. However, the PM warned that 'it would be fatal if this sense of progress were now to breed any kind of complacency because the pressures on the NHS are extraordinary'. Addressing the nation this evening, Mr Johnson that 'day by day, hour by hour, we are making such strides in protecting the population'. 'We have now vaccinated over 3.2million people across the UK, doubling the numbers of last week, that is 2.8million in England, 225,000 in Scotland, 126,000 in Wales and 115,000 in Northern Ireland,' he . 'Yesterday alone we vaccinated around a quarter of a million people in England, that is still far more than any other country in Europe. 'And with almost 45 per cent of our over-80s now vaccinated and almost 40 per cent of care home residents, we are steadily protecting those most at risk.' The Government has set an ambition of vaccinating the 13.9million most vulnerable people in the UK by the middle of February. Advertisement It also emerged today that a Brazilian coronavirus variant that experts fear could make vaccines less effective may have first emerged in Britain in November. Labour accused No10 of 'putting lives at risk' by being too slow to close the borders. The NHS is expected to remain under huge strain for months to come, as the trend in hospital admissions and deaths lags weeks behind cases. And Mr Johnson is still facing calls from experts to tighten the controls. Shadow health secretary Jon Ashworth last night that he believes the mid-February target for vaccinations will be met and should be raised. 'Everyone I've spoken to who understands what's happening with vaccination seems to think they will meet this target,' he told BBC Question Time. 'So I think they will meet that target, but they need to go further and faster. Because if we were able to vaccinate just under 30 million people, we would reduce hospitalisations and deaths by 99 per cent, and we should be targeting that now.' Modelling by Cambridge scientists — whose warnings of 4,000 deaths a day spooked No10 into imposing England's second lockdown — bolstered claims that the original restrictions were working. The team cases began to drop on December 21 and that the ban on Christmas mixing in the worst-hit areas worked to cut the spread. The experts - who believe deaths will peak 'over the coming days' - also put the UK's R-number at now less than one, despite the latest official Government estimate issued last week claiming it was between one and 1.4. The powerful Covid O Cabinet committee met yesterday to consider the state of play, including signing off a travel ban from South America due to fears over an emerging super-strain in Brazil. However, it did not ramp up the lockdown in England. Ministers are instead focusing on improving compliance, with an ad campaign delivering alarming messages such as: 'Don't let a coffee cost lives.' Professor Andrew Hayward, director of the University College London (UCL) Institute of Epidemiology and Health Care and a member of the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), last week's data on cases 'probably relates to the lockdown measures'. But he told Times Radio: 'My concern is that what we've really got going on here is we've more or less split the population in two – those who can afford to stay at home and work and those who can't. 'I suspect what we're really seeing is a very fast decline in those who are staying at home, and either a levelling off or potentially even a continuing increase in those who are continuing to work.' He the national picture was also being impacted by the two different strains of the virus. He added that 'what concerns me' is there is more activity than in the first lockdown, with three times as many people now using the London Underground and twice as many people using cars and buses. Asked if further lockdown measures were necessary, he : 'I do', adding it needed to be possible for 'those people who can't afford to work from home to work from home with the right financial packages to support that'. Professor Sir David Spiegelhalter of the Statistical Laboratory at Cambridge University has coronavirus deaths are likely to peak in the next week to 10 days. Sir David the lockdown measures were having an impact, with the peak in infections having passed 'a good few days ago' which would lead to a reduction in the numbers dying from the disease. 'They are likely to level off in a week - 10 days maybe - at a peak which is probably going to be bigger than the first wave peak of 1,000-a-day, but then should decline due the reductions in cases that we are seeing and, of course, the vaccine programme,' he told BBC Radio 4's The World At One. He warned, however, that hospital admissions would fall more slowly. While the Government's plan to vaccinate all over-70s and the clinically extremely vulnerable by mid-February covered around 90 per cent of those dying from the disease, he only 55 per cent of those being admitted to hospital and 25 per cent of those in intensive care were over 70. 'We are going to see the reduction in hospitalisations and in particular in intensive care is going to be a lot slower,' Sir David . Tories today voiced concerns about the vaccination drive in London, after Mr Khan yesterday complained about a lack of supplies. Only two per cent of people in the capital were vaccinated against coronavirus by January 10, compared to five per cent in the North East and Yorkshire. Fewer than 30 per cent of London's over-80s have had the one dose of the vaccine — compared to the highest figure of 43.8 per cent in the North East and Yorkshire. The first regional breakdown showed the Midlands had vaccinated the most people against the disease, managing to get first doses to 387,647 in the first month of the roll-out. This was more than double the 186,291 in the East of England and almost twice as many as London's 199,986. London has accounted for only 10 per cent of the country's vaccinations so far despite being home to 16 per cent of the population with some nine million people. The capital and the East are the only regions where the share of vaccines has been smaller than the share of the population. NHS leaders in the capital insist that London 'is getting its fair share of vaccine supply' and added: 'We have more than 100 vaccination sites up and running across London, including the NHS Covid-19 vaccination centre in the ExCeL London, and more are opening all the time.' But Tory MP for Wimbledon Stephen Hammond told MailOnline he was 'concerned' about the low vaccination rates - and the capital needed to be 'prioritised' because people lived more closely together. 'I want to make sure London is not left behind. I think they mayor has been rather slow on this,' the former health minister . 'We need to make sure that London is getting the same share of vaccine as the rest of the country, and probably needs slightly higher priority because of the more dense living in London and that's where some of the more vulnerable rates have been in the second outbreak.' Other senior Conservatives they were seeking urgent clarification from ministers on why the numbers were 'very low'. Leaked Government targets show that officials are planning to double the number of people protected against Covid next week alone, aiming to hit 500,000 jabs per day and add 3.6million people to the current total 2.6m. Data yesterday suggested that 223,726 jabs were done on Monday, showing the programme is expanding fast. Modelling by the University of Cambridge, which is used by Public Health England and SAGE, suggests that the overall infection rate in England started to decline on December 21 when it peaked at 117,000 per day Britons obey order to 'stay at home' as anxiety rises to post-April high Britons obeyed the PM's order to 'stay at home' as the latest lockdown began, but anxiety hit the highest level since the virus was running riot last Spring. The latest social indicators showed 62 per cent claimed they had either remained indoors or only gone out for 'essential' reasons last week. That was significantly above than the 41 per cent over Christmas, and the largest proportion since last May. Meanwhile, anxiety was at a peak not seen since last April, with 42 per cent of adults reporting they were suffering. Advertisement Government scientists put the latest reproductive number – the R rate – for the UK at 1.2 to 1.3, for data examined up to January 11. The R rate refers to the number of people that an infected person will pass the virus on to, with an R rate above 1 meaning the epidemic is still growing. The scientists : 'There are some initial indications that areas that have had higher prevalence levels and been under tougher restrictions for a longer period of time (East of England, London, and South East) are experiencing a slight decline in the numbers of people infected. 'Regions such as the North West and South West continue to see infections rise, which is likely to reflect the spread of the new (UK) variant in these areas. 'The latest figures show that we need to remain vigilant to keep this virus under control, to protect the NHS and save lives. 'We all need to play our part, and if everyone continues to follow the rules, we can expect to drive down the R number across the country.' The data from Cambridge University's 'Nowcast' modelling team seem to back up suggestions that cases were starting to come down at the start of the year. Their analysis of deaths and hospital admissions suggests that coronavirus infections for England as a whole peaked at 117,000 per day on December 21 and have been falling almost consistently since to 60,200 per day by January 8. The researchers, who work alongside Public Health England, suggested that infections remained high and rising in the East Midlands, North East, North West and South West into the New Year. But in other areas where lockdowns were tougher in December, including the East of England, London and the South East – as well as the West Midlands and Yorkshire & The Humber – infections appeared to have started tumbling after Christmas. They estimated that there are between 2,500 and 6,500 infections per day in the East, London, North East, South East, South West, West Midlands and Yorkshire & The Humber, but a significantly higher 16,300 per day in the North West. The team make their calculations, which are fed into SAGE, by looking at confirmed Covid-19 deaths and the death rate, which can lead to estimates of earlier case counts, blood testing to look for numbers of past infections, and also officially recorded positive tests. R number eases slightly as peak 'passed' England's coronavirus R rate has dropped this week to between 1.1 and 1.3 but remains higher than the dreaded figure of one, meaning the country's outbreak is still growing. Only London, which has been in lockdown since December 19, is showing signs that cases might be starting to come down, with the R potentially as low as 0.9. SAGE all other regions are still waiting for the effects of the national lockdown to hit. The R rate dictates how many people each infected person passes the virus on to and it must remain lower than one for infections to come down. It adds to growing evidence that Britain's second major outbreak has peaked as an app monitoring the spread of coronavirus in the UK cases fell by 23 per cent last week. The ZOE Covid-19 Symptom Study app estimates there were 54,000 daily infections in the seven days to January 10, below the almost 70,000 the week before. Its estimates are based on weekly reports from a million users, who tell the app whether they are suffering from symptoms of the virus. The figures are the latest glimmer of hope that the UK's second wave may be finally running out of steam, after a Cambridge University study last night the virus' reproduction rate has plunged to as low as 0.6 in London and the South East - meaning the outbreak is now shrinking. Public Health England also revealed weekly Covid cases have fallen in every age group except the over-80s and that infections dropped in dozens of boroughs. Advertisement Their work has been controversial in the past after they predicted that England could hit 4,000 deaths per day at a peak in December and Sir Patrick Vallance and Professor Chris Whitty used the terrifying number at a press conference. Scientists roundly dismissed the figure and the Cambridge team later reduced it significantly to fewer than 1,000. Meanwhile, Downing Street the feared Brazilian variant of coronavirus does not appear to affect vaccines, after a top virologist suggested a separate strain from Brazil is already in the country. The Prime Minister's official spokesman scientists at the Government's Porton Down research facility are currently investigating the new strain, which has been detected in travellers to Japan. It has led to travellers from South America and Portugal being banned from entering the UK. The PM's spokesman : 'As with some of the other variants we've seen, the Kent (UK) variant and the South Africa variant, evidence does suggest that it (the concerning Brazil variant) may be more transmissible. 'More research is required to confirm this and Porton Down will conduct that research but current evidence does not suggest that the strain causes any higher mortality rate or that it affects the vaccines or treatments.' Downing Street it had acted 'as quickly as possible' to impose the ban on travellers from South America, with the concerning Brazilian strain possibly posing a 'significant risk to the UK'. The Prime Minister's official spokesman : 'It's obviously right that we continue to look at different variants and take action accordingly. 'As soon as we identified this variant, our teams were quickly working on this and, given that we know this could pose a significant risk to the UK, we acted as quickly as possible, which is why you've seen this travel ban from those countries enacted quickly.' Earlier, Professor Wendy Barclay, G2P-UK lead and head of department of infectious disease and chairwoman in influenza virology at Imperial College London, was forced to clarify her comments after at first suggesting the concerning strain may be in the UK. She later : 'The new Brazilian variant of concern, that was picked up in travellers going to Japan, has not been detected in the UK. 'Other variants that may have originated from Brazil have been previously found.' The virologist added that both Brazilian variants have mutations that suggest 'they might impact the way that some people's antibodies can see the virus'. She added: 'It is really important that we carry out this work now, and carry it out carefully, and in several different laboratories, to really firm up those results because they have big implications.' Her comments came after Transport Secretary Grant Shapps he was 'not aware' of any cases of the concerning Brazilian strain in the UK which had led him to impose the restrictions, which came into force at 4am on Friday. Why DO experts the outbreak is slowing if the death toll is continuing to soar? How 21-day lag between getting infected and becoming severely ill means fatalities won't peak for another fortnight Prominent SAGE scientists have claimed Britain's winter coronavirus wave is flattening after cases fell for four days straight — despite the country recording its worst death toll ever on Wednesday. Another 1,564 more Covid fatalities were announced yesterday across the UK in the deadliest day since the pandemic began, with the total number of laboratory-confirmed victims on track to pass the grisly 100,000 mark by February. But Sir Patrick Vallance, No10's chief scientific officer, and Professor Neil Ferguson, whose modelling plunged the UK into its first lockdown in March, there are 'early signs' the third national shutdown is slowing the crisis. They have pointed to the fact that, nationally, the number of people catching Covid is trending downwards, with the 47,525 positive tests yesterday across Britain down by a quarter on last week's figure. But there is a roughly three-week time delay between someone catching the disease and dying from it, which means it takes about 21 days for a trend in cases to translate to the fatality figures. Because Britain only went into lockdown a week ago, daily Covid deaths are likely to continue to rise for at least another fortnight before falling. Here, MailOnline answers your questions on the UK's current Covid situation: Are cases going down everywhere? Covid infection rates are falling across swathes of authorities in the UK, according to most recent official data up to January 8. Cases are falling in boroughs in London, the South East and East of England — which were bearing the brunt of the winter wave ahead of the national shutdown on January 4. Infections in Kent — one of the first areas of England to be slapped with the harshest local lockdown measures — were actually slowing before the third lockdown, suggesting the tough Tier Four restrictions in place there were having some effect. In London, the number of people testing positive per 100,000 fell from a peak of 1,116 on January 4 to 1,005 by January 7. But there was a slight uptick again on January 8 across every region, according to Department of Health figures. In the East of England dropped from 856 per 100,000 to 741 and in the South East from 774 to 679 in the same time period. In areas with the lightest rules, however, cases continued to surge late into the year and, despite almost the entire country getting tougher rules on boxing day, continued to rise into the start of lockdown, with some still going up. Professor Paul Hunter, an infectious disease expert at the University of East Anglia, : 'It is too early to be confident that the data from the past few days have indeed meant we have now reached the peak. 'The current positive signs may represent a statistical glitch or a short-lived effect causing recent increases to stall only for the surge to be resumed. 'It is also still too early for this to be driven by the vaccination campaign. Nevertheless if the recent trend is maintained this would be very good news for our NHS.' Why are infections still going up in some parts of country? Infections are still going up in some parts of the country because it takes weeks for lockdown measures to take effect. It is not by chance that the places where cases continue to climb are in areas that enjoyed looser restrictions in December. For example, the Liverpool city region — formerly Britain's Covid hotspot — is seeing steep increases in infection rates again. In Knowsley, where the biggest rise in England happened over the past week, cases were 1,399.3 per 100,000 people in the seven days ending January 9, up from 796.8. Merseyside was under Tier Two restrictions right up until January, which allowed restaurants, cinemas and gyms to stay open. The same was true for places in the South West. Torbay in Devon saw its case rate double in the last week to 254 per 100,000. When will hospital admissions start to fall? Hospital admissions are already falling across London and the South East and are slowing in the East, official figures suggest. Department of Health statistics show daily admissions in the capital hit their high point on January 6 — on day two of the shutdown — when the seven-day average stood at 864. It dropped to 845 the following day. In the South East, hospitalisations also peaked on January 6 when they reached 662. And in the East of England — which was plunged into the highest bracket of restrictions at the same time — they had started to level off by January 4 but have not yet started to fall. But even as admissions have slowed across the capital and in regions first plunged into the toughest bracket, the overall number of patients in hospital is still rising because the number of new cases needing treatment each day is still high. Almost 36,500 infected Britons were receiving NHS care in January 11. Despite the glimmer of hope, which comes alongside falling infections, hospital admissions for patients suffering from the virus are also continuing to rise in the South West, North West, North East and Midlands. The roughly three-week lag between a person catching Covid and falling seriously unwell with it means hospital rates could continue to climb for another fortnight. But they are anticipated to fall after that in line with the infection rate trends. But when will NHS hospitals start to feel ease in pressure? The number of coronavirus infections, hospitalisations, admissions to intensive care and deaths is going to keep rising in the UK for weeks, with the peak not hitting until next month, according to a top NHS chief. Chris Hopson, chief executive of NHS Providers, he expects pressure to spike and begin to tail off in February because the third lockdown does not appear to be working as quickly as the one in spring, he claimed. He warned a health and social care committee of MPs yesterday: 'It is pretty clear the infection rate is not going to go down as quickly as it did in the first phase. 'We were hoping for a sharp peak that came sooner and shorter. So something for example where we saw the peak and started to crest it in mid to late January. 'It now looks like the peak for NHS demand may actually now be in February. Now if that's right that's going to basically mean there's a higher level, and a more extended period of pressure on the NHS than we were expecting even just a week ago.' A wave of admissions was now hitting the East of England into the Midlands, the North West and South West, after London, the South East and the East bore the brunt of the winter wave. 'That's a particular worry because trusts in the Midlands and the North have got significant numbers of patients still in hospital from the second surge.' Why are deaths still rising? Deaths always lag weeks behind cases because of the time it takes for patients to catch and fall ill with Covid. Although it varies from person to person, experts it takes roughly three weeks for an infected person to succumb to the disease. For this reason scientists are able to forecast how deaths will trend based on how infections are fluctuating. UK cases have fallen for four days in a row which appears to show that infections are trending downwards just a week into the national lockdown. Because infections dropped from last week, it would suggest that deaths will follow in about a fortnight's time.""]"

Tens of thousands of Muslims demonstrated Friday across the Middle East in support of the Palestinians and against the intensifying Israeli bombardment of Gaza, underscoring the risk of a wider regional conflict as Israel prepares for a possible ground invasion. From the typically sedate streets of downtown Amman in Jordan, to Yemen's war-scarred capital of Sanaa, crowds of Muslim worshippers poured into the streets after weekly Friday prayers, angered by devastating Israeli airstrikes on Gaza that began after the militant group Hamas launched an unprecedented surprise attack on Israel last Saturday. Thousands of demonstrators gathered Friday in Tahrir Square in the centre of Baghdad, and similar protests have been held in Lebanon and other Arab countries following afternoon prayers. During some of the protests - like in Iran, Bangladesh and Malaysia - angry demonstrators burned Israeli and American flags. In Beirut, thousands of Hezbollah supporters waved Hezbollah and Palestinian flags while holding pictures of burning Israeli ones. And in Berlin, home to one of the largest Palestinian diasporas outside the Middle East, pro-Palestinian protesters clashed with riot police, with one bloodied demonstrator being led away from a square in the German capital. Thousands more gathered in the Jordanian capital of Amman on Friday for a demonstration in support of Palestinians, with many holding banners reading: 'The victory march will continue, solidarity with Palestine' and 'Stand with Palestine, Liberated Palestine'. A masked Palestinian protester takes cover near flaming tires during clashes with Israeli forces following a rally in solidarity with Gaza by supporters of the Fatah and Hamas movements, in the city of Hebron in the occupied West Bank on October 13 IRAQ: Thousands of protesters gather during a protest in solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza, in Baghdad on Friday BANGLADESH: A demonstrator prepares to burn a flag of Israel during anti-Israel protest in Dhaka on Friday GERMANY: A Pro-Palestinian demonstrator is detained during a protest during the ongoing conflict between Israel and the Palestinian Islamist group Hamas, in Berlin on Friday WEST BANK: Protesters kick burning tires as Palestinians take part in a protest following Israeli strikes on Gaza, in Hebron, in the Israeli-occupied West Bank on Friday MALAYSIA: Muslims burn Israeli flags during a rally to show support of Hamas in Kuala Lumpur on Friday PAKISTAN: Supporters of Pakistan Markazi Muslim League burn an Israeli flag during a demonstration in solidarity with the Palestinian people in Peshawar on Friday AUSTRALIA: A protest in support of Palestine in Brisbane on Friday evening INDONESIA: More than 200 people also rallied in front of the National Monument in Indonesia's capital on Friday, waving banners expressing solidarity with the Palestinians SRI LANKA: Sri Lankan Muslims participate in a protest against Israeli airstrikes on Gaza and to show solidarity with Palestinian people in Colombo on Friday IRAN: Iranian worshippers burn a representation of the Israeli flag during their pro-Palestinian rally before the Friday payers in Tehran on Friday The widespread protests come after former Hamas leader Khaled Meshaal demanded thousands take to the streets today. '[We must] head to the squares and streets of the Arab and Islamic world on Friday,' Meshaal, who currently heads Hamas's diaspora office, yesterday. The former terror leader, who is based in Qatar, the governments and peoples of Jordan, Syria, Lebanon and Egypt have a bigger duty to support the Palestinians in comments recorded earlier this week. Jordan and Lebanon are home to the largest number of Palestinian refugees. In Baghdad, tens of thousands gathered in Tahrir Square in the centre of Iraq's capital today for protests called by the influential Shiite cleric and political leader Muqtada al-Sadr. Giant Palestinian flags were seen laid on the ground alongside the flag of Iraq in a sign of solidarity as the Israeli flag was set alight. Demonstrators at the rally chanted: 'No to the occupation! No to America!' 'May this demonstration... terrify the great evil, America, which supports Zionist terrorism against our loved ones in Palestine,' al-Sadr in an online statement. 'This rally is aimed at condemning what is happening in occupied Palestine, the bloodletting and the violation of rights,' Abu Kayan, an organiser of the protest. In Tokyo, Muslims were embroiled in a standoff with police as they protested on the streets outside of the Israeli embassy in the city. Less than 24 hours earlier, pro-Israel supporters were peacefully singing in Hebrew outside of the same building. Across Iran, a supporter of Hamas and Israel's regional archenemy, demonstrators protested. In Tehran, the country's capital, they burned Israeli and Ameircan flags, chanting: 'Death to Israel,' 'Death to America,' 'Israel will be doomed,' and 'Palestine will be the conqueror.' 'The Palestinian people are fed up, now your idea is to destroy Gaza, the houses of the people,' Iran's hard-line President Ebrahim Raisi in a speech in the country's southern Fars province. 'The people of the world and Palestine will cause trouble for you.' Tehran's state television described the Iranian rallies as 'screams of a common pain... The pain of the Zionist regime's (Israel) trampling on humanity'. Meanwhile, Jordanian riot police on Friday forcibly dispersed hundreds of pro-Palestinian protesters trying to reach a border zone with the Israeli-occupied West Bank as thousands held anti-Israel demonstrations across the country, witnesses . More than 10,000 people gathered in central Amman, near the Grand Husseini Mosque, after a call for protests from the Jordanian Muslim Brotherhood, and several leftist and youth groups. Jordan is worried that a regional widening of violence arising from the war between Israel and Palestinian Islamist group Hamas in Gaza could have repercussions for itself given that a large percentage of its population are Palestinians. The nation lost the West Bank including East Jerusalem to Israel in the 1967 Middle East war and the Palestinian territory was seeing a rise in violence between Palestinians and the Israeli military and settlers even before the Gaza conflict erupted. Witnesses police fired tear gas to halt about 500 demonstrators who had reached a security checkpoint outside the capital Amman on a highway leading to a main border crossing. Hamas leader Khaled Meshaal's call for Muslims to 'take the streets' in the wake of the terror group's brutal assault on Israel has resulted in worldwide protests IRAQ: On Friday, photos and videos posted on X showed thousands of Iraqis flooding Baghdad's Tahir Square in support of Hamas IRAQ: People gather next to burning Israeli flags as supporters of Iraqi Shi'ite cleric Moqtada al-Sadr gather during a protest in solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza in Baghdad on Friday IRAQ: Supporters of Iraqi Shi'ite cleric Moqtada al-Sadr gather during a protest in solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza in Baghdad on Friday IRAQ: Thousands of protesters gather during a protest in solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza, in Baghdad on Friday IRAQ: An aerial view of the demonstration in support of pro-Palestine at the al-Tahrir Square in Baghdad, Iraq on Friday IRAQ: Supporters of Iraqi Shi'ite cleric Moqtada al-Sadr gather for mass Friday prayer during a protest in solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza, in Baghdad on Friday IRAQ: Iraqis burn Israeli flags during a mass rally in support of the Palestinians in the Gaza Strip in Baghdad on Friday IRAQ: An aerial view of the demonstration in support of pro-Palestine at the al-Tahrir Square in Baghdad on Friday IRAQ: People stand next to fire as supporters of Iraqi Shi'ite cleric Moqtada al-Sadr gather during a protest in solidarity with Palestinians in Baghdad on Friday The interior ministry had issued a ban against holding anti-Israel marches in the sensitive border area, where it the Jordan river valley was closed to protesters but that licensed protests elsewhere would be allowed. The outpouring of Arab anger against Israel over its siege and bombardment of Gaza retaliating for a devastating cross-border Hamas attack also fuelled a large rally on Friday in downtown Amman and in many of the kingdom's main cities. It comes after Meshaal yesterday: 'Tribes of Jordan, sons of Jordan, brothers and sisters of Jordan... This is a moment of truth and the borders are close to you, you all know your responsibility. 'To all scholars who teach jihad... to all who teach and learn, this is a moment for the application (of theories).' Today, several thousand protesters near downtown Amman chanted slogans in support of Hamas and demanded the government close the Israeli embassy and scrap the 1994 peace treaty with Israel. In the cities of Irbid and Zarqa, thousands took to the streets carrying Hamas flags, vowing revenge against Israel and calling on the terrorists to escalate strikes. The peace treaty remains widely unpopular among Jordanians who see normalisation with Israel as a sellout of the rights of their Palestinian brethren seeking to establish a state in Israeli-occupied territories. The Israeli embassy, where protesters gather daily, has long been a flashpoint of anti-Israel protests at times of turmoil in the Palestinian territories.

Hundreds of people then joined a protest march, some of them waving Palestinian flags and others stamping on Israeli and US emblems that were laid on the ground. And in the Saudi capital Riyadh, where protests are prohibited, an AFP journalist witnessed police cuffing a worshipper who interrupted Friday prayers by shouting at the imam: 'Speak about Palestine! Gaza is under bombs!' Meanwhile in Lebanon, thousands of supporters of Iran-backed Hezbollah rallied in the southern suburbs of Beirut in support of the Palestinians. The protesters waved Lebanese, Palestinian and Hezbollah flags, chanting slogans in support of Gaza and calling for 'death to Israel.' At the event, Hezbollah deputy chief Naim Qassem Hezbollah would be 'fully prepared' to join its ally Hamas in the war against Israel when the time is right. The Iranian-backed terrorist group in neighbouring Lebanon has launched sporadic attacks since the Hamas assault, but largely stayed on the sidelines of the war. Qassem major powers, Arab countries and the UN had 'directly and indirectly' told Hezbollah 'not to interfere' in ongoing fighting between Israel and Hamas. Despite the warnings, the leader of the powerful Iran-backed Lebanese group - which has already clashed with Israeli forces in recent days - it was 'ready' and would 'contribute' to confrontations against its southern neighbour. Qassem's comments came as Israel's defence minister Yoav Gallant this afternoon called Hamas, Hezbollah and Iran an 'axis of evil'. 'Iran, Hezbollah and Hamas is one axis, an axis of evil. Everything is decided generally from Iran,' he .

'When the time is right to take action, we will do so.' In Yemen's Sanaa, held by the Iranian-backed Houthi rebels still at war with a Saudi-led coalition, live television footage showed demonstrators crowding streets and waving Yemeni and Palestinian flags. The rebels' slogan long has been: 'God is the greatest; death to America; death to Israel; curse of the Jews; victory to Islam.' After prayers in Islamabad, Pakistan's capital, some worshippers stepped on American and Israeli flags, in a sign of disrespect. Protests there broke up peacefully, though other larger ones were expected later in the day. 'Stop bombing Palestine!' shouted one of the demonstrators, Ahmed Raza. 'Stop killing innocent Palestinians!' Political and religious parties staged dozens of small demonstrations across the cities of Karachi, Lahore, Peshawar, and the capital Islamabad, where US and Israeli flags were burned. 'There is so much tyranny meted out to Palestinians, nobody can tolerate it. It is a waste of life if we don't stand by the righteous,' Tahira Khan, a 50-year-old designer who joined one of several protests in Karachi attended by around 2,000 people. Protester Shahid Husain, 47, the leaders of Muslim nations were failing to stand up for Palestinians.

A few hundred people also gathered in the Afghan cities of Kabul and Jalalabad for pro-Palestinian rallies organised by Taliban authorities. 'Palestine you are not alone, we are with you,' one speaker told the crowd. 'We are poor, but we will do whatever we can. We can't do much today but use our feet and stand in your support.' At the weekend, Hamas gunmen killed more than 1,300 people in Israel in the deadliest attack since the country's creation in 1948. They seized around 150 hostages - including dozens of Israelis, dual and foreign nationals - whom Hamas is threatening to kill. Israel has retaliated by raining air and artillery strikes in Gaza for six days, claiming more than 1,500 lives and displacing over 400,000 people in the crowded enclave. Meanwhile at the Al-Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem, Israeli police had been permitting only older men, women and children to the sprawling hilltop compound for prayers, trying to prevent the potential for violence as tens of thousands attend on a typical Friday. Police allowed just a Palestinian teenage girl and her mother into the compound out of 20 worshippers who tried to get in, some of them even over the age of 50.

'We can't live, we can't breathe, they are killing everything that is good within us,' Ahmad Barbour, a 57-year-old cleaner in a clean white thobe, seething after police blocked him from entering for prayers. 'Everything that is forbidden to us is allowed to them,' he added, referring to Israelis. The mosque sits in a hilltop compound sacred to both Jews and Muslims, and conflicting claims over it have spilled into violence before. Al-Aqsa is the third-holiest site in Islam and stands in a spot known to Jews as the Temple Mount, which is the holiest site in Judaism. Police later fired tear gas in the Old City and east Jerusalem. The Palestinian Red Crescent its medics treated six wounded people, with at least one beaten up by officers, the organization . Meshaal's call for a Friday 13th uprising was reiterated by Hamas itself, according to the Israeli-run, Washington DC-based Middle East Media Research Institute (MEMRI).

The phrase Israel's most wanted man used in an audio tape broadcast as Hamas fired thousands of rockets out of the Gaza Strip over the weekend signalled the attack was their payback for Israeli raids at Jerusalem's Al Aqsa mosque. 'We declare next Friday, ''The Friday of the Al-Aqsa Flood,'' as a day of general mobilization in our Arab and Islamic world and among the free people of the world,' Meshaal's statement . 'It is a day to rally support, offer aid, and participate actively. It is a day to expose the crimes of the occupation, isolate it, and foil all its aggressive schemes. It is a day to demonstrate our love for Palestine, Jerusalem, and Al-Aqsa. 'It is a day for sacrifice, heroism, and dedication, and to earn the honour of defending the first Qibla of Muslims, the third holiest mosque, and the ascension of the trusted Messenger.'

In response to the barbaric attacks, which has seen 1,300 Israelis massacred including pregnant women and children, Israel has launched a relentless barrage of airstrikes that have obliterated entire neighbourhoods in Gaza and killed 1,530 Palestinians. The Israeli airstrikes have so far flattened much of the town of Beit Hanoun in the Palestinian enclave's north-east corner, which Hamas terrorists had been using as a staging ground for their attacks. And in a sign that Israel has no notion of stopping its airstrikes, the IDF today issued an evacuation order directly on Friday morning, telling the 1.1 million people living north of an area called Wadi Gaza to move south. This would mean the entire population of Gaza City and its surroundings fleeing their homes. The UN it is impossible to move that many people without devastating humanitarian consequences, and has urged Israel to rescind the order.

But Palestinians are preparing for a ground offensive of unprecedented scale on the tiny, crowded enclave, exceeding previous bouts of destructive warfare. Palestine's health minister also warned that Gaza is facing a humanitarian and health catastrophe and urged all countries and human rights groups to help with the immediate entry of medical and emergency aid to the enclave. Meanwhile, Arab League chief Ahmed Abul Gheit branded the Israeli order a 'forced transfer' that he constitutes a 'crime', while the secretary general of the pan-Arab body, in a letter sent to UN chief Antonio Guterres, accused Israel of carrying out 'an atrocious act of revenge... punishing helpless civilians in Gaza'.

'Thirteen prisoners... including foreigners' were killed in five locations targeted by Israeli fighter jets, Hamas's armed wing Friday. Israel's military sent one evacuation order directly on Friday morning, telling the 1.1 million people living north of an area called Wadi Gaza to move south. This would mean the entire population of Gaza City and its surroundings fleeing their homes. According to translations of the IDF flyers online, the army told residents that 'terrorist organisations have started the war against the State of Israel.' As a result, it 'Gaza City has become a battlefield' and told residents they had to evacuate 'Punik immediately and go to the south of the Gaza Valley.' It also issued a stark warning to Palestinians not to try and cross into Israel.

'Generally and well-known shelters in Gaza City must be evacuated. It is forbidden to approach the security wall, and everyone who is approaching exposes himself to death.' A small map was also printed on the bottom of the flyer, with arrows pointing from the north of Gaza to the south, showing the 1.1 million Palestinians which way to flee. The Israeli military had it would operate with 'significant force' in Gaza in the coming days amid fears of a huge ground offensive. Spokesman Jonathan Conricus Israeli forces 'will make extensive efforts to avoid harming civilians'. He added: 'Out of an understanding that there are civilians here who are not our enemy and we do not want to target them, we are asking them to evacuate.' But the UN has it is impossible to move that many people without devastating humanitarian consequences, and has urged Israel to rescind the order. Suffering in Gaza has been rising dramatically with Palestinians desperate for food, fuel and medicine and the territory's only power plant shut down for lack of fuel. The morgue at Gaza's biggest hospital overflowed as bodies came in faster than relatives could claim them.

The Hamas Authority for Refugee Affairs called on residents of the north of the territory to 'remain steadfast in your homes and to stand firm in the face of this disgusting psychological war waged by the occupation'. The flurry of directives was taken as signalling an already expected Israeli ground offensive, though the Israeli military has not yet confirmed such a decision. On Thursday it that while it was preparing, no official decision has been made. Any ground offensive would be the strongest response yet to Hamas' shock assault, and would likely bring even higher casualties on both sides in brutal guerrilla warfare as Israeli soldiers go house-to-house and hunt down Hamas terrorists. 'This evacuation is for your own safety,' the Israeli military , in a warning it was sent to all Gaza City civilians.'

At least 1,500 Palestinians have been killed in the indiscriminate bombing campaigns, and Israel has also traded barbs with Lebanon's Hezbollah group. Human Rights Watch it verified videos taken in Lebanon on Oct. 10 and Gaza on Oct. 11 showing 'multiple airbursts of artillery-fired white phosphorus over the Gaza City port and two rural locations along the Israel-Lebanon border'. White phosphorus munitions can legally be used on battlefields to make smoke screens, generate illumination, mark targets or burn bunkers and buildings. Because it has legal uses, white phosphorus is not banned as a chemical weapon under international conventions - but it can cause serious burns and start fires. White phosphorous is considered an incendiary weapon under Protocol III of the Convention on the Prohibition of Use of Certain Conventional Weapons, which prohibits using incendiary weapons against military targets located among civilians, although Israel has not signed it and is not bound by it. 'White phosphorous is unlawfully indiscriminate when airburst in populated urban areas, where it can burn down houses and cause egregious harm to civilians,' Human Rights Watch on Thursday. Asked for comment on the allegations, Israel's military it was 'currently not aware of the use of weapons containing white phosphorous in Gaza.' It did not provide comment on the rights watchdog's allegations of their use in Lebanon. Palestinian TV channels have broadcast video in recent days showing thin plumes of white smoke lining the sky over Gaza that they was caused by such munitions. Israel's military in 2013 it was phasing out white phosphorus smokescreen munitions used during its 2008-2009 offensive in Gaza, which drew war crimes allegations from various rights groups. The military at the time did not whether it would also review use of weaponised white phosphorus, which is designed to incinerate enemy positions."", ""Nine police officers were injured and missiles were thrown amid efforts to disperse pro-Palestine protesters outside the Israeli Embassy in London on Saturday.

Israeli military spokesman Lt Col Jonathan Conricus : 'According to our estimates we're talking about between 20,000 and 30,000 rockets in Gaza today, rockets and mortars. 'We've seen a constant expansion in terms of range and also in terms of the size of the warheads. They have an advanced arsenal of rockets, I think it's on a par with the fire capabilities of a few small European countries.'

Israel's army last week it had received a rocket warning in the north of the country, the first time the alert has been given there since hostilities soared between Israel and Palestinians earlier this week.

In a statement Mr Jenrick continued: 'Whatever your view of the conflict in Israel and Gaza, there is no justification for inciting anti-Jewish or anti-Muslim hatred. The incidents of anti-Semitism we have seen in recent days have been shameful. 'Some of the language used on marches this weekend and in posts on social media is intimidating, criminal and racist. 'We must not tolerate this vile, shameful hate in our country. These actions must stop.' Cabinet minister Michael Gove described another video appearing to show protesters shouting anti-Semitic abuse as 'deeply concerning'. Meanwhile spokesperson for Community Security Trust, a charity providing safety for the Jewish community in the UK, Dave Rich : 'This video of vile antisemitism being shouted from a car as it passed through an area of London with a large Jewish community has caused enormous upset and alarm. 'It is outrageous and we are working closely with the police to assist in identifying the culprits. 'Tonight is the beginning of the Jewish festival of Shavuot and it is disgraceful that Jewish people should be subjected to this kind of intimidation as they prepare to celebrate.' Nigel Farage also condemned the convoy of cars, which were seen filling the roads across north London, as their horns blared and called on Home Secretary Priti Patel to act. 'This footage from Golders Green is shocking, provocative and dangerous,' Mr Farage tweeted. 'The Home Secretary and the police must act right now.' It comes after nine police officers were injured and missiles were thrown amid efforts to disperse pro-Palestine protesters outside the Israeli Embassy in London on Saturday. Further protesters have gathered in the capital today, with pro-Palestinian protesters scuffling with police.

Riot police reacted with force, spraying desperate Parisians with water cannons to try to dispel the crowds. In Birmingham hundreds of demonstrators descended on the city centre today in support of Palestine amid escalating violence between the Arab state and Israel. Organisers in London 'immediate action' is needed by the UK Government to help end the 'brutal' violence against the Palestinian people.

Organisers demonstrator numbers were estimated at 150,000. Coloured smoke was set off along Kensington High Street and some demonstrators climbed on to buildings and bus stops. Among the buildings to be scaled were the offices of the MailOnline, where protesters climbed on scaffolding and set off fireworks. It comes as thousands of Palestinians have been forced to flee from their homes after a week of sustained conflict. Since Monday night, Palestinian militant group Hamas has fired hundreds of rockets into Israel, whose military responded by barraging the Gaza Strip with tank fire and air strikes. At least 126 people have been killed in Gaza, including 31 children and 20 women. In Israel eight people have been killed, including a six-year-old boy and a soldier.

'It's our global voices that will give succour, comfort and support in those settlements alongside Gaza and all over the West Bank, East Jerusalem who are suffering at this time. 'End the occupation now. End all the settlements now and withdraw then. End the siege of Gaza now.' Husam Zumlot, Palestinian ambassador to the UK, told crowds: 'This time is different. This time we will not be denied any more. We are united. We have had enough of oppression. Today we are saying enough, enough with the complicity. Thank you for standing with us.'

It is estimated up to one thousand people filed down crowded streets from Victoria Square to the Bull Ring. Saturday is the Palestinian Nakba day, which marks the anniversary of the expulsion of hundreds of thousands of Arabs from their homes more than 70 years ago. The Birmingham protests came after an Israeli rocket destroyed a media building in Gaza and an Israeli airstrike hit a Gaza refugee camp, killing ten people, including eight children. Hamas responded with a barrage of rockets on Israeli cities, killing one person in Tel Aviv. The fighting began May 10 when Hamas fired long-range rockets toward Jerusalem after days of clashes between Palestinian protesters and Israeli police at the Al-Aqsa Mosque compound, a flashpoint site sacred to Jews and Muslims. On Saturday, demonstrators in London marched from Marble Arch Station to the Israeli embassy, holding banners and chanting. The Metropolitan Police : 'Officers are engaging with a group of people who have gathered for a demonstration in central London this afternoon. 'A policing plan is in place to ensure everybody is kept safe and to reduce the spread of Covid-19.' It comes amid reports an Israeli air strike destroyed a high-rise building that housed the AP, Al-Jazeera and other media in the Gaza Strip. The AP the air strike came roughly an hour after the Israeli military ordered people to evacuate the building. Demonstrators walk through Hyde Park as they make their way to the Israeli embassy in London, during a march in solidarity with the people of Palestine amid the ongoing conflict with Israel Protesters at a rally to express solidarity with Palestine at Marble Arch on May 15 in London after several Israeli cities experienced clashes between Jewish and Arab mobs in recent days Among those expected to address the crowds are former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, Diane Abbott and Zarah Sultana. It comes as thousands of Palestinians have been forced to flee from their homes after a week of sustained conflict The news agency there was no immediate explanation as to why the building was targeted. The demonstration in London was organised by Palestine Solidarity Campaign, Friends of Al-Aqsa, Palestinian Forum in Britain, Stop The War Coalition, Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament and the Muslim Association of Britain. A spokesperson for the organisers : 'It is vital that the UK Government takes immediate action. It must stop allowing Israel's brutal violence against and oppression of the Palestinian people to go unpunished. 'The bombardment of Gaza which is killing civilians including children is a war crime. The UK Government is complicit in these acts as long as it continues to offer Israel military, diplomatic and financial support.' It comes after a week of rising tensions, when Israel on Thursday pressed ahead with a fierce military offensive in the Gaza Strip, killing as many as 11 senior Hamas military figures and toppling a pair of high-rise towers housing Hamas facilities in a series of airstrikes. The Islamic militant group showed no signs of backing down and fired hundreds of rockets at Israeli cities, including heavily populated Tel Aviv and Jerusalem. Palestinian militants have stockpiled enough missiles to continue bombing Israel for the next two months, security experts have warned, as escalating fighting led the UN to warn of 'all-out war'. PARIS: Marches in support of Palestinians in the Gaza Strip were also held today in a dozen French cities, but the focus was on Paris, where riot police got ready as organizers they would defy a ban on the protest.

The conflict sparked hundreds of demonstrators across the US Wednesday. In Downtown Chicago, a rally organized by the Chicago Coalition for Justice in Palestine, drew a crowd of nearly 1,000 protestors who Palestinians were being mistreated. One woman held sign that : 'Free Palestine!' In New York, protesters clashed in Times Square, with both sides screaming at each other and separated by barricades. Pro-Israel supporters could be seen draped in flags. In Cleveland, an Israel supporter asked people not to forget the people suffering in that country, even though he Palestinians are made out to be the victims. And in Los Angeles, pro-Israel demonstrators gathered in front of the city's federal building; the prior day in the city there had been skirmishes between the factions, but photos from the scene showed only Israel supporters waving American and Israel flags. A protester wears a mask with the Palestinian flag painted on it as demonstrators marched through Hyde Park Flares were set off as the march continued through Hyde Park en route to the Israeli embassy Protesters held white roses and draped themselves in the Palestinian flag as they marched on Saturday Hundreds of people joined the protest as demonstrators marched in solidarity with the Palestinian people Demonstrators started gathering outside Marble Arch Station at midday for the march on Saturday Marches in support of Palestinians in the Gaza Strip were also held today in a dozen French cities, but the focus was on Paris, where riot police got ready as organizers they would defy a ban on the protest. Paris police chief Didier Lallement ordered shops closed around the starting point of the planned march in a working-class neighbourhood in northern Paris after an administrative court confirmed the ban. Authorities noted a banned July 2014 pro-Palestinian protest against an Israeli offensive in Gaza that degenerated into violence and running battles with police to justify the order against Saturday's march. Pictured: Israeli boy, five, killed by Hamas rocket shrapnel A five-year-old boy killed in Israel by rocket fire from Gaza has been pictured, after he became one of the country's seven victims of the latest cross-border conflict. Ido Avigal was fatally stuck by shrapnel after the building he was in with his mother was hit by a missile on Wednesday night. In the building, found in the town of Sderot on the border with Gaza, seven people were hurt when it suffered a direct hit from a rocket. Ido Avigal, who was killed in his home in Sderot by a rocket fired from Gaza on May 12, 2021. Avigal was pronounced dead several hours later, becoming the seventh Israeli victim of the cross border conflict that started earlier this week The boy's mother grabbed him and took him into a fortified room when the in-coming rocket sirens sounded, according to local Hebrew media reports cited by the Times of Israel. However, in a rare tragedy, shrapnel from the rocket punctured the shelter's window, critically wounding the boy and also injuring his mother. Avigal was pronounced dead several hours later, becoming the seventh Israeli victim of the cross border conflict that started earlier this week. Advertisement Organizers they intend to 'denounce the latest Israeli aggressions' and mark the fleeing of Palestinians after Israel declared independence in 1948. In Israel heightened tensions led to street brawls in areas populated by Jews and Arabs, with an Arab man dragged from his car and beaten by Jewish ultranationalists in one attack, while in another a Jewish citizen was attacked by sticks and stones by Arab Israeli protesters. At least 122 people have been killed in Gaza since violence escalated on Monday, according to the enclave's health ministry. Eight people have been killed in Israel, medical officials . One of the Israelis - a five-year-old boy named Ido Avigal - was killed by shrapnel on Wednesday night in the Gaza border town of Sderot when rockets struck the building he was living in with his mother. Britain's Boris Johnson led international leaders in calling for the two sides to step back from the brink, but a UN Security Council meeting failed to agree on a joint statement due to opposition from the United States, Israel's key ally, diplomats . Pleas for calm appeared in vain as Israeli and Palestinian leaders traded blood-curdling threats and further rocket strikes, with a rocket setting off alarms in the north of Israel in the early hours of Thursday morning - some 62 miles North of Gaza - sending thousands of Israelis to shelters. And after a senior Hamas commander was killed Wednesday, the Islamist militant group responded with a barrage of rockets into southern Israel which rescue workers killed a six-year-old boy. Israel's defence minister Benny Gantz vowed more attacks on Gaza to bring 'total, long-term quiet' before they would consider truce talks after six days of violence. Prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu his military would only use 'increasing force' in the conflict. 'We eliminated senior Hamas commanders and this is just the beginning,' he . 'We will inflict blows on them that they couldn't even dream of.' The leader of Hamas Ismail Haniyeh hit back, vowing that 'if Israel wants to escalate, we are ready for it'. Six high-ranking commanders and a further five key Hamas figures were 'neutralised' on Wednesday, including Brigadier General Bassem Issa and Jamal Zabda, head of the group's rocket unit, according to the Israeli Defence Force (IDF). On Tuesday, Mr Johnson tweeted a plea for both sides to 'step back from the brink' and 'show restraint'. He added: 'The UK is deeply concerned by the growing violence and civilian casualties and we want to see an urgent de-escalation of tensions.' His calls were backed up by similar messages from the EU, the US, Russia and Turkey. The UN's Middle East peace envoy Tor Wennesland warned the latest violence was 'escalating towards a full-scale war'. And UN secretary-general Antonio Guterres he was 'gravely concerned' by the ongoing troubles. Hamas and Islamic Jihad fired more than 1,000 missiles in the first 48 hours of the conflict which began on Monday, an average of one every three minutes, and has enough to keep the bombardment going for two months. Israeli military spokesman Lt Col Jonathan Conricus : 'According to our estimates we're talking about between 20,000 and 30,000 rockets in Gaza today, rockets and mortars. 'We've seen a constant expansion in terms of range and also in terms of the size of the warheads. They have an advanced arsenal of rockets, I think it's on a par with the fire capabilities of a few small European countries.' Six high-ranking commanders and a further five key Hamas figures were 'neutralised' on Wednesday, including Brigadier General Bassem Issa and Jamal Zabda, head of the group's rocket unit, according to the Israeli Defence Force (IDF) While Israel's Iron Dome aerial defence system has intercepted nine out of ten Palestinian rockets, the remainder have killed at least six civilians and injured more than 90. Families in Tel Aviv have taken cover in underground shelters. Israel's retaliation has included hundreds of air strikes on Gaza, led by F-35 stealth bombers and Apache attack helicopters, which are understood to have killed 32 and wounded more than 300. Israel most of the dead were terrorists and insists the children killed were victims of stray Palestinian rockets. The UN security council met Tuesday to discuss the crisis. The heaviest offensive between Israel and Hamas since a 2014 war in the Hamas-ruled enclave has increased international concern that the situation could spiral out of control. 'Israel has gone crazy,' a man on a Gaza street, where people ran out of their homes as explosions rocked buildings. Israel's army last week it had received a rocket warning in the north of the country, the first time the alert has been given there since hostilities soared between Israel and Palestinians earlier this week. The approximately 1,500 rockets fired from Gaza by Hamas militants since Monday had so far set off warnings in southern and central Israel, but not in the north, the army . However in the small hours of the morning of May 6, alarms not only sounded in the economic capital Tel Aviv in the middle of the country - where residents rushed to shelters - but also in Jezreel Valley in the north. There was no immediate word of a rocket strike or casualties in Nahalal, some 100 km (62 miles) from Gaza.""]"

'Three rioters were wounded when they were hit by bullets, they remain in hospital,' police added, in an update after earlier reporting two wounded. Authorities are investigating the shootings including whether the wounded people where hit by police bullets, they added. The city's mayor, Ahmed Aboutaleb, the protest had turned into 'an orgy of violence.' 'Police were forced to draw their weapons and even fire direct shots,' he told a news conference early on Saturday. Dutch Justice Minister Ferd Grapperhaus in a statement the 'extreme violence' against police and firefighters in Rotterdam was 'repulsive.' 'The right to protest is very important in our society but what we saw last night was simply criminal behaviour,' Grapperhaus . Protesters had gathered to voice opposition to government plans to restrict access to indoor venues to people who have a 'corona pass,' showing they have been vaccinated or have already recovered from an infection. The pass is also available to people who have not been vaccinated, but have proof of a negative test. Advertisement Europe descended into a second night of violent carnage on Saturday amid the return of strict lockdown rules aimed at curbing rising rates of Covid infection. Thousands of people took to Amsterdam's central Dam Square and the Hague on Saturday, a day after the 'orgy of violence' during the Rotterdam riots that saw seven people injured. Police seven arrests were made on Sunday after youths set streets ablaze and shot fireworks at officers. Video footage from the Hague showed motorists sounding their horns in support as a trio of small explosions could be clearly seen on the main road in the background. Elsewhere, protestors were pictured ripping down street signs in chaotic scenes. Anti-riot police were forced to clear the wreckage of smouldering scooters and burnt-out bicycles that were torched by the anti-vax mob and left to block roads in one of the worst outbreaks of violence in the country since Covid restrictions were first implemented. Meanwhile, similar demonstrations against virus restrictions also took place in Switzerland, Croatia, Italy, Northern Ireland, Austria and North Macedonia on Saturday, a day after Dutch police opened fire on protesters and seven people were injured in rioting that erupted in Rotterdam. It comes as violence broke out in Vienna on Saturday as 10,000 protesters - many from far-right groups - took to the streets to demonstrate against new Covid-19 restrictions and mandatory vaccinations. Police were pictured arresting two protesters. A spokesman there had been fewer than 10 arrests, for breaches of coronavirus restrictions and the ban on Nazi symbols. Some protestors mockingly wore doctor's scrubs, while others donned tinfoil hats. Chanting 'resistance!', waving Austrian flags and blowing whistles, the crowd swelled to more than 30,000. Many held signs mocking government leaders including Chancellor Alexander Schallenberg and Health Minister Wolfgang Mueckstein. Protesters rallied against coronavirus restrictions and mandatory COVID-19 passes needed in many European countries to enter restaurants, Christmas markets or sports events, as well as mandatory vaccinations. In Italy, 3,000 turned out in the capital's Circus Maximus, a field where in ancient times Romans staged popular entertainment, to protest against 'Green Pass' certificates required at workplaces, restaurants, cinemas, theaters, sports venues and gyms, as well as for long-distance train, bus or ferry travel within Italy. In Northern Ireland, several hundred people opposed to vaccine passports protested outside the city hall in Belfast, where the city's Christmas market opened Saturday - a market where proof of vaccination or a negative COVID-19 test was required. The Northern Ireland government voted this week to introduce vaccine certificates for admission to nightclubs, bars and restaurants starting Dec. 13. 'People like us never give up,' read one banner, in the red, white and green colors of the Italian flag. Virtually no one at the Rome protest wore a protective mask. Switzerland saw 2,000 people protest an upcoming referendum on whether to approve the government's COVID-19 restrictions law, claiming it was discriminatory, public broadcaster SRF reported. In Croatia, thousands gathered at in the capital Zagreb, carrying Croatian flags, nationalist and religious symbols, along with banners against vaccination and what they describe as restrictions of people's freedoms. And in Denmark, more than one thousand gathered outside the Danish parliament in Copenhagen to push back against the reintroduction of the national health pass. North Macedonia also saw hundreds of anti-vaccination protesters march in downtown Skopje on Satruday evening against the country's health authority's recommendation of mandatory vaccinations. Demonstrations against virus measures are also expected in other European countries - the latest in rising anger at the re-introduction of restrictions amid soaring cases on the continent. This comes as the World Health Organization (WHO) it was 'very worried' about the spread of Covid-19 within Europe as the continent battles a fresh wave of infections. Regional director Dr Hans Kluge told the BBC that some 500,000 more deaths could be recorded by March unless urgent action is taken.

The island's prefect on Friday introduced the night-time stay-at-home order after protests against the coronavirus vaccine pass spiralled into violence the previous night. But the measure did little to quell the rioting. 'The night was very turbulent,' a police source . The security forces recorded 'some 20 incidents of looting or attempted robbery' in the seaside towns of Pointe-a-Pitre and Le Gosier, including at a jewellery shop, a bank, a betting shop and a shopping centre. In the town of Saint-Francois to the east, 'gendarmes coming out of the station were threatened by blazing projectiles'. A second source within the gendarmerie an armoury had been looted. The first source 'firearms were used against police forces in four different areas' across the island, and one member was slightly wounded after a stone hit him in the face. In the area of Le Petit-Bourg to the west, firemen had to put out fires in two mobile phone stores, which had also been plundered. The interior ministry 31 people had been arrested. France late Saturday it was sending around 50 personnel from both its RAID elite police force and its GIGN counter-terrorism unit to Guadeloupe. The doctors' union in Guadeloupe warned against further trouble while the health system was so 'fragile'. They criticised 'individuals who may have prevented patients from getting access to treatment, or medical staff from reaching their place of practice'. While most people in mainland France have now received two vaccination doses, rates in its overseas territories have lagged behind. By November 16, some 46 percent of adults in Guadeloupe had received at least one jab of a vaccine against Covid. Advertisement Five police officers were injured during rioting at the Hague, with one taken to hospital suffering concussion and two suffering hearing damage from loud fireworks,. A rock thrown by rioters also smashed the window of a passing ambulance carrying a patient, the city's police force . Elsewhere in the Netherlands, two football matches in the Eredivise, the top professional league, were briefly halted after fans - banned from matches under a partial lockdown in force in the Netherlands for a week - broke into stadiums in the towns of Alkmaar and Almelo. Earlier Saturday, two protests against COVID-19 measures went off peacefully in Amsterdam and the southern city of Breda. Police in a tweet that seven people were arrested in The Hague and five officers were injured. One needed treatment in a hospital. Local media reported that rioters threw bicycles, wooden pallets and motorized scooters on one of the fires. The chaos in The Hague was on a smaller scale than the pitched battles on the streets of Rotterdam on Friday night, when police that three rioters were hit by bullets and investigations were underway to establish if they were shot by police. Officers in Rotterdam arrested 51 people, about half of them minors, police Saturday afternoon. One police officer was hospitalized with a leg injury sustained in the rioting, another was treated by ambulance staff and 'countless' others suffered minor injuries. Mayor Ahmed Aboutaleb told reporters in the early hours of Saturday morning that 'on a number of occasions the police felt it necessary to draw their weapons to defend themselves' as rioters rampaged through the port city's central shopping district, setting fires and throwing rocks and fireworks at officers. 'They shot at protesters, people were injured,' Aboutaleb . He did not have details on the injuries. Police also fired warning shots. Justice Minister Ferd Grapperhaus condemned the events. 'The riots and extreme violence against police officers, riot police and firefighters last night in Rotterdam are disgusting to see,' he in a statement. 'Protesting is a great right in our society, but what we saw last night is simply criminal behavior. It has nothing to do with demonstrating,' he added. An independent investigation into the shootings by police was opened, as is the case whenever Dutch police use their weapons. As the march kicked off on Vienna's Heldenplatz, thousands of protesters gathered on the massive square. About 1,300 police officers were on duty. They used loudspeakers to tell protesters masks were required, but most did not wear them. Chanting 'resistance!' and blowing whistles, protesters began to move slowly down the city's inner ring road. Many waved Austrian flags and carried signs mocking government leaders like Chancellor Alexander Schallenberg and Health Minister Wolfgang Mueckstein. Some wore doctor's scrubs; others donned tinfoil hats. Most of the signs focused on the newly announced vaccine mandate: 'My Body, My Choice,' read one. 'We're Standing Up for Our Kids!' another. By mid-afternoon the crowds had swelled to roughly 35,000 people, according to the police, and were marching down Vienna's inner ring road before heading back towards the Hofburg. Police were pictured arresting two protesters. A spokesman there had been fewer than 10 arrests, for breaches of coronavirus restrictions and the ban on Nazi symbols. Meanwhile, a few hundred protesters gathered in Amsterdam today and a similar number marched through the southern city of Breda over the latest Covid-19 measures. Riots also erupted in the central 'Bible Belt' town of Urk and cities in southern Limburg province, while angry fans disrupted two football matches being played behind closed doors because of coronavirus rules, Dutch media . It comes after violent riots last night in which 51 were arrested in Rotterdam after thousands of anti-lockdown protesters gathered on one of the city's main shopping streets. Dutch police fired water canons, 'warning shots' and bullets at protesters to disperse the crowd who had lit fires and set off fireworks. Police confirmed seven injuries, including officers, in the violence but did not if live ammunition or rubber bullets were fired. The Netherlands re-imposed some lockdown measures last weekend for an initial three weeks in an effort to slow a resurgence of coronavirus contagion, but daily infections have remained at their highest levels since the start of the pandemic. The Dutch government has it wants to introduce a law that would allow businesses to restrict the country's coronavirus pass system to only people who are fully vaccinated or have recovered from Covid-19 - that would exclude people who test negative. The violent scenes in Rotterdam mirrored much of the continent's reaction to similar schemes announced by Austria, Germany, the Czech Republic, and Slovakia - with Italy and Greece also reportedly considering moves to restrict the movements of unvaccinated people.

It reveals that Slovakia has the highest infection rate in the region, followed closely by Austria Austria becomes first EU country to mandate jabs Austria on Friday became the first EU country to announce it would make coronavirus vaccinations mandatory and will next week impose a partial lockdown in the face of spiralling infections. The lockdown, which comes into effect on Monday, constitutes the toughest restrictions introduced in Europe in recent weeks as Covid-19 cases surge continent-wide, fuelled by vaccine resistance. Austrians will not be allowed to leave home except to go to work, shop for essentials and exercise. The restrictions will initially last 20 days with an evaluation after 10 days, Chancellor Alexander Schallenberg . Vaccination against Covid-19 in the Alpine nation will be mandatory from February 1 next year, Schallenberg . So far, the Vatican alone in Europe has imposed a vaccination mandate. The World Health Organization continues to favour policies that 'demonstrate the benefit and safety of vaccines for the greatest possible acceptance of vaccines, rather than imposed mandatory vaccination,' spokeswoman Fadela Chaib told reporters in Geneva. Austria has already imposed movement restrictions on those not vaccinated or recently recovered from the virus, ordering them to stay at home since Monday, becoming the first EU country to do so. But infections have continued to rise. On Friday, a new record of more than 15,800 new cases was recorded in the EU member of nearly nine million people. Reporting by AFP Advertisement Austrians are protesting against a new national lockdown and mandatory vaccinations, which the government yesterday would be rolled out on February 1. Vaccinations in Austria have plateaued at one of the lowest rates in Western Europe - under 66 per cent - and hospitals in heavily hit states have warned that their intensive care units are reaching capacity. Austrian Chancellor Alexander Schallenberg yesterday the country would go in lockdown for 10 days. The shutdown will then reevaluated and could be extended for a further 10 days. Most stores will close, and cultural events will be canceled. People will be able to leave their homes only for certain specific reasons, including buying groceries, going to the doctor or exercising. Average daily deaths have tripled in recent weeks and its infections are among the highest in Europe, with a seven-day incidence of 991 per 100,000 people. 'We have not succeeded in convincing enough people to get vaccinated,' Chancellor Alexander Schallenberg told a news conference. 'It hurts that such measures still have to be taken.' Schallenberg also apologised to all vaccinated people on Friday night saying it was not fair they had to suffer under the renewed lockdown restrictions when they had done everything to help contain the virus. 'I'm sorry to take this drastic step,' he on public broadcaster ORF. Despite the violence a day earlier, around 300 protesters marched through the southern Dutch town of Breda near the Belgian border on Saturday carrying banners with slogans such as 'No Lockdown'. Organisers they opposed Prime Minister Mark Rutte's plans to exclude the unvaccinated from bars and restaurants. A group that had called an Amsterdam protest for Saturday, United We Stand Europe, on Facebook it had cancelled the rally because 'last night, all hell broke loose in Rotterdam'. But several hundred flag-waving protesters still gathered in central Dam Square, watched over by police vans, according to Dutch media and images on social media.

Local news outlet NL Times reported that a journalist was attacked of the street, while local broadcaster Rijnmond the reporter was beaten and his camera was destroyed. Local media also reported gangs of soccer hooligans were involved in the rioting. One eyewitness - a press photographer – told local media they saw shell casings 'everywhere on the floor'. Cops also it was 'unclear how or by whom' two people were shot during the chaos. Video from social media on Dutch broadcaster NOS appeared to show the person being hit in Rotterdam, but there was no explanation on what happened. Officers arrested 51 protesters last night and were expected to detain several more after studying video footage from security cameras. Late on Friday night, police downtown Rotterdam remained restive and there was still a heavy police presence on the streets. Mayor Ahmed Aboutaleb told reporters in the early hours of Saturday morning that 'on a number of occasions the police felt it necessary to draw their weapons to defend themselves' as rioters ran rampage through the port city's central shopping district, setting fires and throwing rocks and fireworks at officers. 'They shot at protesters, people were injured,' Aboutaleb , adding that several officers were injured in the violence. Police spokesperson Patricia Wessels confirmed that police fired shots, though it was not immediately clear what type of rounds were fired. 'We fired warning shots and there were also direct shots fired because the situation was life-threatening,' she . 'We know that at least two people were wounded, probably as a result of the warning shots, but we need to investigate the exact causes further.'

Professor John Edmund today that opposition to stringent restrictions on the continent have demonstrated the importance of booster jabs, warning, 'it is pretty clear immunity does wane'. 'What you see now in central Europe with these rapid increase in cases, you see the importance of vaccination,' Mr Edmund told Sky. But Mr Edmund the UK was unlikely to be hit by the Christmas chaos because the country 'is in a slightly different position.' He added: 'Frankly here in the UK, we've had high rates of infection for many months now so we're in a slightly different position to Austria and Germany and so on. 'I don't think things will quite happen in the same way here as they have done there. But it is a warning to us. I think it's pretty clear that immunity does wane. 'I'm sure you do still have some protection from the vaccine but it's nowhere near as strong as shortly after you've been vaccinated. It's very clear the booster doses do give a very clear boost to your immune system.' Asked whether the Government should re-introduce control measures, Mr Edmund told Sky: 'The plan B measures, we could've implemented them at any point. It's a government decision whether to take that step. 'They have to look at the potential effectiveness and measure that against the potential cost of some of those things.' Advertisement Riot police carrying shields and batons were directing groups of people away from the area. Officers on horseback and in police vans patrolled the streets. Police also cordoned off several scenes to comb for evidence, with a human finger visible on the ground at one of them, the AFP correspondent . 'Most of the demonstrators are now gone. There only remain a few groups in a few places,' police spokesman Jesse Brobbel told AFP. Dutch justice minister Ferd Grapperhaus in a statement that the 'extreme violence' against police and fire fighters in Rotterdam was 'repulsive'. 'The right to protest is very important in our society but what we saw last night was simply criminal behaviour,' Grapperhaus . Dutch police units from around the country were brought in to 'restore order' to Rotterdam. 'Dozens of arrests have now been made, it is expected that more arrests will follow. Around seven people have been injured, including on the side of the police,' a police statement . At least one police car was set on fire during the protest, a police spokesman confirmed to AFP. The spokesperson could not confirm the number of people injured. Several electric scooters and other items were also torched, with several hundred protesters involved in the riots, images on Dutch media and social media showed. Local authorities issued an emergency order banning people from gathering in the area in a bid to prevent further violence, and the authorities also called on bystanders and people who recorded images of the riots to send the footage to police for further investigation. Police tweeted that rioters started fires and threw fireworks during the rioting and authorities closed the city's main railway station. The several hundred people had gathered to voice opposition to government plans to restrict access to indoor venues to people who have a 'corona pass' showing they have been vaccinated or already recovered from an infection. The pass is also available to people who have not been vaccinated, but have proof of a negative test. 'This is a very serious situation which requires action with the highest priority,' the emergency order by the Rotterdam municipality. 'It is therefore necessary to issue this emergency order so as to maintain public order and to protect the safety of persons.'

It announced that the daily tally jumped to 22,936 on Friday, almost 500 more than the previous record set on Tuesday. The country's infection rate has risen to 929 new cases per 100,000 residents over the past seven days. In a worrying sign, 110 people died on Thursday, the ministry , with the daily death toll surpassing 100 for the first time since April. The government has approved new restrictions to tackle the surge, targeting the unvaccinated in an effort to increase a vaccination rate that is below the European Union average. Starting on Monday, most unvaccinated people will no longer be allowed to show negative coronavirus tests in order to attend public events, go to bars and restaurants, visit hairdressers, museums and similar facilities or use hotels. Only people who are vaccinated or have recovered from Covid-19 will remain eligible. Overall, the nation of 10.7 million has registered almost two million cases with 32,005 deaths. Advertisement Local political party Leefbaar Rotterdam condemned the violence in a tweet. 'The centre of our beautiful city has this evening transformed into a war zone,' it . 'Rotterdam is a city where you can disagree with things that happen but violence is never, never, the solution.' Like much of the rest of Europe, the Netherlands has seen Covid cases soar to record levels in recent days, with more than 21,000 new infections reported on Friday. The latest restrictions were announced on November 12, and sparked clashes between demonstrators and police outside the justice ministry in The Hague. The restrictions came into force the following day, shuttering bars, restaurants, cafes and supermarkets at 8:00 pm daily, while non-essential shops must shut at 6:00 pm. People are limited to having four visitors at home and have been advised to work at home unless absolutely necessary. Public events have been scrapped while football matches must be played behind closed doors. Schools however remain open, and people are allowed to leave their homes without restrictions. The Dutch government has it will review the situation on December 3. It is considering excluding the unvaccinated from bars and restaurants, limiting admittance to people who have been vaccinated or who have recovered from the disease, but there was significant opposition to the plan during a debate in parliament this week. The Netherlands suffered its worst riots in four decades in January after a night-time Covid curfew, the country's first since World War II, came into force. Earlier Friday, the government banned fireworks on Dec. 31 for the second straight year. The ban is intended 'to prevent, as much as possible, extra strain on health care, law enforcement and first responders,' the government Friday. The riots in Rotterdam come after Austria on Friday that it will become the first country in western Europe to reimpose a full Covid-19 lockdown, while neighbouring Germany warned it may follow suit, sending shivers through financial markets worried about the economic fallout. Restrictions have also been placed on the unvaccinated in Germany – where they have been banned from restaurants – as well as in the Czech Republic and Slovakia.

'The situation is very, very serious and difficult,' Markus Soeder, premier of the southern state of Bavaria, as he also announced a shutdown of clubs, bars and night service at restaurants. The eastern state of Saxony unveiled similar measures and went even further by closing all sporting and cultural venues, banning tourism, public consumption of alcohol and barring the unvaccinated from non-essential shops and hairdressers. Saxony premier Michael Kretschmer - whose state has Germany's lowest vaccination rate at just under 60 percent of the population - admitted that many of the restrictions would affect the vaccinated as well. But he tough action was needed to keep hospitals from being overwhelmed and called for 'solidarity' from all citizens. 'We need more 'we' and less 'I' in this pandemic,' he told reporters. Bavaria and Saxony are among the hardest hit regions in the ferocious fourth Covid wave sweeping Germany. Reporting by AFP Advertisement Following the announcement, Freedom Party leader Herbert Kickl posted a picture on Facebook with the inscription: 'As of today Austria is a dictatorship.' The party is planning a protest on Saturday, but Kickl cannot attend because he has tested positive for Covid-19 and must self-isolate for 14 days. Europe has again become the epicentre of the pandemic, accounting for half of global cases and deaths, the WHO . A fourth wave of infections has plunged Germany, Europe's largest economy, into a national emergency, Health Minister Jens Spahn , warning that vaccinations alone will not cut case numbers. Both decisions infuriated many in a country where scepticism about state mandates affecting individual freedoms runs high, encouraged by the far-right Freedom Party, the third biggest in parliament. Asked if Germany could rule out an Austrian-style full lockdown, Spahn : 'We are now in a situation - even if this produces a news alert - where we can't rule anything out. 'We are in a national emergency,' he told a news conference. Looming lockdowns weighed on a range of financial market sectors on Friday, pushing stocks and oil down and boosting the dollar. 'We expect targeted measures (against COVID-19) across some countries mainly according to the health situation, but other factors, such as domestic political situations, will be relevant,' Oxford Economics analysts in a note. 'And while it might take a while before a political consensus can be reached in other countries, it is clear that the tide has turned.' As cases rise again, a number of European governments have started to reimpose limits on activity, ranging from Austria's full lockdown to a partial lockdown in the Netherlands and restrictions on the unvaccinated in parts of Germany, the Czech Republic and Slovakia. Niels Van Regenmortel, the intensive care units coordinator at the ZNA Stuivenberg hospital in Antwerp, there was an increasing risk hospitals in Belgium will have to resort to triage as ICUs fill up amid soaring COVID-19 numbers, calling on the government to restrict night life.

It reveals that Sweden is in the bottom half of countries for vaccine uptake, but ahead of nations including the UK and Germany Europe has become the epicentre of the pandemic once again, with the World Health Organisation warning that the Continent was the only region in the world where deaths had increased - with Covid-related fatalities spiking by five per cent just this week What Covid restrictions are in place in Sweden? The country- which dodged a lockdown unlike most other nations - also has next to no Covid restrictions in place. It dropped its final measures recommending people to work from home where possible on September 29. And advice for people to wear face masks on public transport was abandoned on July. Unlike in other countries the coverings were never compulsory. On November 11 Swedish health authorities went even further telling double-vaccinated people they no longer needed to swab themselves for the virus. But this move has now been reversed after critics it left the country in a dangerous position just before winter. Some travel restrictions are still in place for people coming to the country from non-EU nations and Britain. All arrivals are required to show a certificate they have been double-vaccinated. When this is not possible they are asked to show a negative Covid test result from to come to the country from non-EU countries. All arrivals are also required to prove they up to 48 hours before they travelled. Sweden will impose further restrictions from December 1 requiring everyone attending events of more than 100 people to show proof they are double-vaccinated. Officials have warned more Covid restrictions may be needed this winter. Advertisement Whether or not countries opt to lock down again depends on a wide range of factors, including vaccination rates, mask mandates and the extent to which booster shots are being made available. Germany has further measures will be decided based on when hospitalisation rates hit certain thresholds, while Friday saw its first states - Saxony and Bavaria - cancel all their Christmas markets. The Bavarian state capital of Munich on Tuesday had become the first major German city to cancel its Christmas market for the second year in a row. Saxony's cancellations means the famed Dresden Christmas market is also scrapped. Germany hosts some 2,500 Christmas markets each year, cherished by visitors who come to savour mulled wine and roasted chestnuts, and shop for seasonal trinkets among clusters of wooden chalets. In pre-pandemic times, they drew about 160 million domestic and international visitors annually who brought in revenues of three to five billion euros ($3.4 billion to $5.6 billion), according to the BSM stallkeepers' industry association. In France, President Emmanuel Macron has made it clear he thinks high levels of vaccinations should be enough to avoid future lockdowns. Britain, with higher numbers of infections than most countries in Europe, is rolling out third shots - or boosters - to offset waning protection from the first two and help keep the economy open. While the new measures across Europe are not seen hitting the economy as much as the all-out lockdowns of last year, analysts they could weigh on the recovery in the last quarter, especially if they hurt the retail and hospitality sectors over Christmas. A full lockdown in Germany would be more serious, however. 'With Germany ... imposing new restrictions, any thoughts that the vaccines would offer a way to a more normal Christmas period appear to have gone up in smoke for now, in Europe at least,' Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK. 'Although there is a nagging fear this could ripple out across the region.' The pressure on intensive care units in Germany has not yet reached its peak, Spahn , urging people to reduce contacts to help break the wave. 'How Christmas will turn out, I dare not . I can only it's up to us,' he added.

A couple hug and laugh as they have lunch in a restaurant in Stockholm, Sweden EU issues advice on using Covid-19 pill for adults The European Union's drug regulator has issued advice on using Merck's COVID-19 pill for adults and began a review of a rival tablet from Pfizer to help member states decide on quick adoption ahead of any formal EU-wide approval. In two separate statements on Friday, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) detailed efforts to advance use of the experimental but promising options, as infections and COVID-related deaths are rapidly rising in the region and forcing renewed lockdowns. Merck's COVID-19 tablet, Lagevrio, developed with Ridgeback Biotherapeutics, should be given early and within five days of first symptoms to treat adults who do not need oxygen support and are at risk of their disease worsening. It advised against treatment during pregnancy and for women who plan to or could get pregnant, while adding that breastfeeding must also be stopped around the time of using the pill, which is to be taken twice a day for five days. Drugs in the same class as Merck's Lagevrio have been linked to birth defects in animal studies. The drugmaker, known as MSD outside the United States and Canada, has animal testing shows its pill is safe, but the data have not been made public. EMA it was studying available data on the Pfizer pill Paxlovid, days after the drugmaker sought U.S. approval, adding that a more comprehensive rolling review was expected to start ahead of any approval. It did not specify when that review would be. The EMA last month began a rolling review of the Merck pill and expects to conclude that evaluation by the end of the year. Advertisement Chancellor Angela Merkel on Thursday Germany will limit large parts of public life in areas where hospitals are becoming dangerously full of COVID-19 patients to those who have either been vaccinated or have recovered from the illness. 'It's clear from our experience in England and from what's happening across Europe that while vaccines do a lot of the heavy lifting ... other interventions are required to prevent case numbers rising,' Lawrence Young, virologist and professor of molecular oncology at the University of Warwick. 'Less mask wearing, more mixing indoors due to colder weather and waning immunity are also contributing to the high case levels across Europe.' Sweden, meanwhile, has the lowest Covid infection rate in western Europe — after double-vaccinated nationals were told they don't have to test for the virus even if they get symptoms. The Scandinavian nation — which was subject to international scrutiny last year when it refused to lockdown — is currently recording 85.4 cases per million people, according to Oxford University research site Our World in Data. By comparison, the rate is nearly 1,400 per million in Europe's current Covid capital Austria, which today announced it is going back into a full lockdown from Monday. Sweden's infection rate is far lower than other Western European countries like the Netherlands (1,048.7), Britain (581), Germany (536), and France (201). And for the first time in the pandemic, Sweden is recording fewer cases per population size than its Scandinavian neighbours Denmark (655), Norway (351) and Finland (150). But critics Sweden has been left 'in the dark' over the true extent of its coronavirus wave because the double-vaccinated, equivalent to almost seven in ten people, are not being routinely swabbed. Last week, Sweden broke ranks with its European neighbours once again and told Swedes they did not have to get tested if they were fully jabbed, even if they had symptoms. Covid swabbing rates plunged 35 per cent last week, compared to a month earlier. But this week the policy was reversed in response to rising cases on the continent. A fresh wave of Delta is rolling across the continent and putting pressure on hospitals once again, which has forced most in the EU to bring back some form of curbs. Latest figures show Sweden is only carrying out 1.26 tests per 1,000 people, which is also the lowest number in western Europe. The threat of fresh lockdowns comes as optimism grows about experimental drugs developed by Pfizer and Merck that cut the chance of hospitalisation and severe illness, more weapons in the world's fight against the virus. On Friday, the EU drug regulator it was reviewing data on Pfizer's COVID-19 pill to help member states decide on quick adoption ahead of any formal EU-wide approval. Slovakia has also seen a surge in infections, with 9,171 reported on Friday, its biggest daily tally since the pandemic began. The country of 5.5 million earlier in the week tightened restrictions on people who have not had COVID-19 shots. With a seven-day incidence of 11,500 new cases per million inhabitants, the country has the worst reported epidemic situation in the world, according to Our World in Data statistics."", ""Europe descended into a third day of violent carnage on Sunday as tens of thousands of people in Belgium took to the streets to protest against the return of strict lockdown rules aimed at curbing a rise in Covid infections. Nearly 40,000 people descended on the capital Brussels to protest against new anti-Covid measures banning the unvaccinated from entering restaurants and bars. Some protesters were seen throwing projectiles at riot police and in response, officers fired water cannon and tear gas at the group. Police have made some arrests, but it is not immediately clear how many. Video footage from Brussels shows a large group of protesters shouting at police as some light flares and throw them at the officers. One man can even be seen mooning at them. The protests descended into chaos, with some of the protesters seen setting fires on the streets while others threw rocks through the windows of local businesses including a post office. Two police cars have also been damaged. The protest came just hours after it emerged Germany is set to follow Austria's example in making vaccinations compulsory with ministers admitting that the move is 'unavoidable' amid a fourth wave of the pandemic which is crippling the country's hospitals. Last night also saw similar demonstrations against virus restrictions take place in Austria, Switzerland, Croatia, Italy, Northern Ireland, Austria and North Macedonia on Saturday, a day after Dutch police opened fire on protesters and seven people were injured in rioting that erupted in Rotterdam. Europe has become the epicentre of the pandemic once again, with the World Health Organisation warning that the Continent was the only region in the world where deaths had increased as Covid-related fatalities spiked by five per cent just this week. In France, the government has warned that the fifth wave of coronavirus are rising at 'lightning speed', with new daily Covid cases close to doubling over the past week. In Belgium, cases have been surging, with infections reaching 13,836 on Sunday. In response, the government has introduced restrictions including a ban on the unvaccinated from venues such as restaurants and bars, and an order to work from home at least four days a week. Police 35,000 protesters marched from the North Station in Brussels on Sunday afternoon against a fresh round of Covid measures announced by the government on Wednesday. The demonstration, called 'Together for Freedom', saw some protesters clash with riot police near the Belgian capital's EU and government district. Many of the protesters caught up in the clash were wearing hoods and carried Flemish nationalist flags. A total of 42 people were detained and two were arrested in the riots. Meanwhile, three police officers were injured and taken to hospital and one protester was hurt after a firework exploded in his hand.

Several police officers were injured after protesters threw bottles and fireworks at them. Last week, Belgium's Prime Minister Last week, Belgium's Prime Minister Alexander De Croo 'the alarm signals are all red' as he imposed tough restrictions, ordering people to work at home for at least four days a week. Under new restrictions, all people in indoor venues such as cafes and restaurants will need to wear a mask unless seated and the rule will apply to those aged 10 or older. The previous age threshold was 12. Nightclubs may have to test their guests if they want to let them dance mask-free. People wanting to eat in a restaurant or go to the theatre already must present a COVID pass, showing vaccination, a negative test or recent recovery. Most Belgians will also have to work from home four days a week until mid-December, and for three days after that. Belgium has one of the highest cases per capita rates in the European Union, behind only the Baltic and former Yugoslav nations and Austria, at around one per hundred people over the past 14 days, according to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control. 'The alarm signals are all red,' prime minister Alexander De Croo told a news conference. 'We had all hoped to have a winter without coronavirus, but Belgium is not an island.' Niels Van Regenmortel, the intensive care units coordinator at the ZNA Stuivenberg hospital in Antwerp, there was an increasing risk hospitals in Belgium will have to resort to triage as ICUs fill up amid soaring COVID-19 numbers, calling on the government to restrict night life. In Germany, the number of Covid cases are soaring daily, with the country reporting 48,201 infections on Saturday - the highest number of new coronavirus cases since the beginning of the pandemic. The fourth wave is overwhelming hospitals, with health chiefs warning that the situation is 'extremely critical' across the country. In France, fifth-wave coronavirus infections are rising at an alarming rate, the government reported Sunday, with new daily Covid cases close to doubling over the past week. In Germany, a relatively low vaccination rate - hovering under 70 per cent - has left the country vulnerable to the virus. Germany's federal tourism commissioner Thomas Bareiß has now the worsening situation makes it clear that compulsory vaccination is 'unavoidable'. Bareiß told DPA news agency: 'In retrospect, it was wrong not to see that right from the start. The hope at that time is understandable, but it was not realistic.' His calls were echoed by the Prime Minister of Bavaria, which has seen Covid cases surge, who 'in the end we will not be able to avoid compulsory vaccination'. The above graph shows the Covid infection rate per million people for western European countries from November last year.

Pictured: Protesters in Brussels on Sunday Riot police raise their shields as they clash with protesters on a bridge in Brussels on Sunday during anti-vaccine demonstrations Thousands of protesters, many of them peaceful, marched through the streets of Brussels on Sunday. Some held signs which read 'Stand up for your rights' and 'Stop the madness' Mr Bareiß, the tourism commissioner of Germany's federal government, a compulsory vaccination is 'unavoidable'. Putin tells Russia he had Covid booster jab Russian President Vladimir Putin on Sunday he had taken a third dose of a Covid vaccine, as the country struggled with a fresh wave of the virus. 'I had it two hours ago,' Putin on state television channel Rossiya 24, assuring viewers that his booster injection of the Sputnik vaccine had been painless. The authorities are struggling to convince people to get vaccinated against Covid, even as a fresh wave of the virus is killing record numbers every day. Even though Russia has several vaccines that it has manufactured itself, only 36.7 percent of the population is fully vaccinated, according to the Gogov website, which tracks the data. Putin, who he opposes universal mandatory vaccination, has backed measures taken in some regions for certain people. For example, in June, authorities in Moscow vaccination would be obligatory for anyone working in the service sector. Russia recorded more than 9.3 million cases of Covid and just over 264,000 deaths, which makes it the worst-hit country in Europe. The actual toll from the pandemic there was closer to 450,000 at the end of September, according to figures from the Rosstat statistics agency however, which works with a broader definition of Covid-linked deaths. Advertisement He : 'For me it is politically no longer justifiable that entire industries, retailers, restaurants, clubs, bars and the entire cinema, cultural and event scene live in a state of crisis prescribed by the state for 20 months and are faced with great existential fears, while others are concerned take the freedom not to vaccinate. 'So far, historical measures and sums of money have been able to save many companies. That doesn't work in the long run.' In Bavaria, there has been a 'dramatic' coronavirus resurgence. It prompted the Bavarian state capital of Munich to become the first major German city to cancel its Christmas market, which usually draws some three million visitors. The Bavarian Prime Minister Markus Söder he believes the country will 'not be able to avoid' compulsory vaccination. He told Berliner Zeitung: 'I believe that in the end we will not be able to avoid compulsory vaccination. Otherwise it will be an endless loop with this coronavirus.' The director of Frankfurt University Hospital the situation in intensive care units in the state of Hesse is 'critical'. Jürgen Graf, who is also the head of the planning staff for the inpatient care of Covid patients in Hesse at the Ministry of Health, told Bild: 'The situation is extremely critical. What we are currently doing is crisis management.' He added: 'This is not a problem for Covid patients, it affects everyone,' explaining that inpatient care and the care of emergency patients are 'impaired' due to longer wait times. The warning comes as a hospital in Bavaria's Freising last week made the unprecedented decision to transfer a Covid-19 patient to northern Italy because it 'had no more capacity to receive them, and the surrounding hospitals were also full.' Almost one per cent of the new infections end up in the intensive care unit, Graf . 'Given the current number of infections, that would be 50 or more patients per week in addition to the approximately 250 patients treated there today,' he added. 'Then in a few weeks we will be well above last winter's high.' The fourth wave is overwhelming hospitals, with health chiefs warning that the situation is 'extremely critical' across the country. Pictured: Doctors and nurses tend to a patient on the Covid-19 intensive care unit at University Hospital Leipzig on November 18 THE NETHERLANDS: A day after Rotterdam rioting that saw seven people injured, thousands more took to Amsterdam's central Dam Square and The Hague (pictured above), with seven arrests being made according to police AUSTRIA: Protesters carrying a banner reading 'Control the border. Not your people' at the anti-lockdown demonstration held by the far-right Freedom Party in Vienna today The fourth wave of infections has plunged Germany, Europe's largest economy, into a national emergency, Health Minister Jens Spahn . He urged people to reduce their social contacts, warning that vaccinations alone would not reduce case numbers. Asked if Germany could rule out an Austrian-style full lockdown, Spahn : 'We are now in a situation - even if this produces a news alert - where we can't rule anything out. 'We are in a national emergency,' he told a news conference. Their comments come after the upper house of parliament on Friday approved new measures to control the outbreak proposed by the centre-left alliance that emerged after the September 26 national election. Three people treated in hospital and inquiry launched after Dutch police fired warning shots during Rotterdam riots Three people were being treated in hospital in Rotterdam on Saturday after they were seriously injured when Dutch police fired shots during a violent protest against COVID-19 measures, authorities . Crowds of several hundred rioters torched cars, set off fireworks and threw rocks at police during the protests on Friday evening. Police responded with warning shots and water canons. Rotterdam police posted on Twitter on Saturday that 51 people had been arrested, half of whom were under 18. 'Three rioters were wounded when they were hit by bullets, they remain in hospital,' police added, in an update after earlier reporting two wounded. Authorities are investigating the shootings including whether the wounded people where hit by police bullets, they added. The city's mayor, Ahmed Aboutaleb, the protest had turned into 'an orgy of violence.' 'Police were forced to draw their weapons and even fire direct shots,' he told a news conference early on Saturday. Dutch Justice Minister Ferd Grapperhaus in a statement the 'extreme violence' against police and firefighters in Rotterdam was 'repulsive.' 'The right to protest is very important in our society but what we saw last night was simply criminal behaviour,' Grapperhaus . Protesters had gathered to voice opposition to government plans to restrict access to indoor venues to people who have a 'corona pass,' showing they have been vaccinated or have already recovered from an infection. The pass is also available to people who have not been vaccinated, but have proof of a negative test. Advertisement The measures include requirements for people to prove they are vaccinated, recently recovered from Covid-19 or have tested negative for the virus in order to access communal workplaces or public transport. Separately, outgoing Chancellor Angela Merkel agreed with the governors of Germany's 16 states to introduce a new threshold linked to the number of hospital admissions of Covid-19 patients per 100,000 people over a seven-day period. The new three-tier system would require people to show evidence of a vaccination or previous infection to enter public buildings or businesses in states where hospitalisation rates go above 3 in 100,000 people, based on a seven-day average. At present, that will affect 9 of Germany's 16 states. In France, the seven-day average of new cases reached 17,153 on Saturday, up from 9,458 a week earlier, according to the health authorities, an increase of 81 percent. 'The fifth wave is starting at lightning speed,' government spokesman Gabrial Attal . The latest seven-day increase is three times the average rise of cases recorded over the previous three weeks, indicating an exponential acceleration of infections. For now the spike in infections has not led to a massive influx of Covid patients into hospitals, with the authorities attributing the limited number of intensive care patients to France's high rate of vaccinations which appear highly effective against the most dangerous forms of Covid. On Saturday, hospitals reported a total of 7,974 Covid patients in their care, with 1,333 of them in intensive treatment. This compares to 6,500 and 1,000, respectively, a month earlier. 'There is a very strong increase in infections, but we also know that in France we have a very large vaccination cover,' he . 'We seem to be ahead of our neighbours concerning booster shots.' France's introduction of a health pass ahead of other countries in the summer was also helping to keep Covid in check, he . The health pass, required in French restaurants, cafes and many cultural venues, certifies that a person is fully vaccinated, has recently recovered from Covid, or has tested negative for the virus. The government continues to stand by its choice to 'bring the weight of restrictions to bear on non-vaccinated people rather than vaccinated people', Attal Last night, Europe descended into a second night of violent carnage amid the return of strict lockdown rules aimed at curbing rising rates of Covid infection. Thousands of people took to Amsterdam's central Dam Square and the Hague on Saturday, a day after the 'orgy of violence' during the Rotterdam riots that saw seven people injured. Police seven arrests were made on Sunday after youths set streets ablaze and shot fireworks at officers. Video footage from the Hague showed motorists sounding their horns in support as a trio of small explosions could be clearly seen on the main road in the background. Elsewhere, protesters were pictured ripping down street signs in chaotic scenes. Anti-riot police were forced to clear the wreckage of smouldering scooters and burnt-out bicycles that were torched by the anti-vax mob and left to block roads in one of the worst outbreaks of violence in the country since Covid restrictions were first implemented. Meanwhile, similar demonstrations against virus restrictions also took place in Switzerland, Croatia, Italy, Northern Ireland, Austria and North Macedonia on Saturday, a day after Dutch police opened fire on protesters and seven people were injured in rioting that erupted in Rotterdam. It comes as violence broke out in Vienna on Saturday as 10,000 protesters - many from far-right groups - took to the streets to demonstrate against new Covid-19 restrictions and mandatory vaccinations. Police were pictured arresting two protesters. A spokesman there had been fewer than 10 arrests, for breaches of coronavirus restrictions and the ban on Nazi symbols. Some protesters mockingly wore doctor's scrubs, while others wore the yellow stars as badges in reference to Nazi Germany's policy of forcing Jews to wear the badge as identification. Chanting 'resistance!', waving Austrian flags and blowing whistles, the crowd swelled to more than 30,000. Many held signs mocking government leaders including Chancellor Alexander Schallenberg and Health Minister Wolfgang Mueckstein. Protesters rallied against coronavirus restrictions and mandatory COVID-19 passes needed in many European countries to enter restaurants, Christmas markets or sports events, as well as mandatory vaccinations. The Austrian protest, which was promoted by the far-right opposition Freedom Party, became violent and five police officers were injured - a development which Austria's Interior Minister Karl Nehammer slammed as 'unacceptable'. Nehammer told a press conference on Sunday morning: 'If at a meeting that is organised and promoted by a parliamentary party, where police officers are attacked and Nazi crimes are played down by wearing the Jewish star, that is unacceptable.' The protesters had worn the yellow Jewish star as badges, with the words 'unvaccinated' stitched on, as they compared the lockdown and mandatory vaccination measures with the atrocities of the Nazi era. Nehammer : 'This is not only completely tasteless, it plays down the crimes of the National Socialists and offends the millions of victims of the Nazi dictatorship and their families.' The interior minister some of the protesters were from right-wing extremist groups, with some setting fire to a police car and confessing that they 'wanted to burn a police officer'. 'This is an extent of radicalisation that is by no means acceptable,' Nehammer , adding that the police officers 'professionally ensured security in a difficult mission'. AUSTRIA: Thousands of residents - one holding a sign reading 'no to mandatory vaccination' - today gathered in Vienna to demonstrate against new Covid restrictions amid soaring infection rates across the continent In Italy, 3,000 turned out in the capital's Circus Maximus, a field where in ancient times Romans staged popular entertainment, to protest against 'Green Pass' certificates required at workplaces, restaurants, cinemas, theaters, sports venues and gyms, as well as for long-distance train, bus or ferry travel within Italy. In Northern Ireland, several hundred people opposed to vaccine passports protested outside the city hall in Belfast, where the city's Christmas market opened Saturday - a market where proof of vaccination or a negative COVID-19 test was required. The Northern Ireland government voted this week to introduce vaccine certificates for admission to nightclubs, bars and restaurants starting Dec. 13. 'People like us never give up,' read one banner, in the red, white and green colors of the Italian flag. Virtually no one at the Rome protest wore a protective mask. Switzerland saw 2,000 people protest an upcoming referendum on whether to approve the government's COVID-19 restrictions law, claiming it was discriminatory, public broadcaster SRF reported. In Croatia, thousands gathered at in the capital Zagreb, carrying Croatian flags, nationalist and religious symbols, along with banners against vaccination and what they describe as restrictions of people's freedoms. And in Denmark, more than one thousand gathered outside the Danish parliament in Copenhagen to push back against the reintroduction of the national health pass. North Macedonia also saw hundreds of anti-vaccination protesters march in downtown Skopje on Satruday evening against the country's health authority's recommendation of mandatory vaccinations. Demonstrations against virus measures are also expected in other European countries - the latest in rising anger at the re-introduction of restrictions amid soaring cases on the continent. This comes as the World Health Organization (WHO) it was 'very worried' about the spread of Covid-19 within Europe as the continent battles a fresh wave of infections. Regional director Dr Hans Kluge told the BBC that some 500,000 more deaths could be recorded by March unless urgent action is taken.

The island's prefect on Friday introduced the night-time stay-at-home order after protests against the coronavirus vaccine pass spiralled into violence the previous night. But the measure did little to quell the rioting. 'The night was very turbulent,' a police source . The security forces recorded 'some 20 incidents of looting or attempted robbery' in the seaside towns of Pointe-a-Pitre and Le Gosier, including at a jewellery shop, a bank, a betting shop and a shopping centre. In the town of Saint-Francois to the east, 'gendarmes coming out of the station were threatened by blazing projectiles'. A second source within the gendarmerie an armoury had been looted. The first source 'firearms were used against police forces in four different areas' across the island, and one member was slightly wounded after a stone hit him in the face. In the area of Le Petit-Bourg to the west, firemen had to put out fires in two mobile phone stores, which had also been plundered. The interior ministry 31 people had been arrested. France late Saturday it was sending around 50 personnel from both its RAID elite police force and its GIGN counter-terrorism unit to Guadeloupe. The doctors' union in Guadeloupe warned against further trouble while the health system was so 'fragile'. They criticised 'individuals who may have prevented patients from getting access to treatment, or medical staff from reaching their place of practice'. While most people in mainland France have now received two vaccination doses, rates in its overseas territories have lagged behind. By November 16, some 46 percent of adults in Guadeloupe had received at least one jab of a vaccine against Covid. Advertisement Five police officers were injured during rioting at the Hague, with one taken to hospital suffering concussion and two suffering hearing damage from loud fireworks,. A rock thrown by rioters also smashed the window of a passing ambulance carrying a patient, the city's police force . Elsewhere in the Netherlands, two football matches in the Eredivise, the top professional league, were briefly halted after fans - banned from matches under a partial lockdown in force in the Netherlands for a week - broke into stadiums in the towns of Alkmaar and Almelo. Earlier Saturday, two protests against COVID-19 measures went off peacefully in Amsterdam and the southern city of Breda. Police in a tweet that seven people were arrested in The Hague and five officers were injured. One needed treatment in a hospital. Local media reported that rioters threw bicycles, wooden pallets and motorized scooters on one of the fires. The chaos in The Hague was on a smaller scale than the pitched battles on the streets of Rotterdam on Friday night, when police that three rioters were hit by bullets and investigations were underway to establish if they were shot by police. Officers in Rotterdam arrested 51 people, about half of them minors, police Saturday afternoon. One police officer was hospitalized with a leg injury sustained in the rioting, another was treated by ambulance staff and 'countless' others suffered minor injuries. Mayor Ahmed Aboutaleb told reporters in the early hours of Saturday morning that 'on a number of occasions the police felt it necessary to draw their weapons to defend themselves' as rioters rampaged through the port city's central shopping district, setting fires and throwing rocks and fireworks at officers. 'They shot at protesters, people were injured,' Aboutaleb . He did not have details on the injuries. Police also fired warning shots. Justice Minister Ferd Grapperhaus condemned the events. 'The riots and extreme violence against police officers, riot police and firefighters last night in Rotterdam are disgusting to see,' he in a statement. 'Protesting is a great right in our society, but what we saw last night is simply criminal behavior. It has nothing to do with demonstrating,' he added. An independent investigation into the shootings by police was opened, as is the case whenever Dutch police use their weapons. As the march kicked off on Vienna's Heldenplatz, thousands of protesters gathered on the massive square. About 1,300 police officers were on duty. They used loudspeakers to tell protesters masks were required, but most did not wear them. Chanting 'resistance!' and blowing whistles, protesters began to move slowly down the city's inner ring road. Many waved Austrian flags and carried signs mocking government leaders like Chancellor Alexander Schallenberg and Health Minister Wolfgang Mueckstein. Some wore doctor's scrubs; others donned tinfoil hats. Most of the signs focused on the newly announced vaccine mandate: 'My Body, My Choice,' read one. 'We're Standing Up for Our Kids!' another. By mid-afternoon the crowds had swelled to roughly 35,000 people, according to the police, and were marching down Vienna's inner ring road before heading back towards the Hofburg. Police were pictured arresting two protesters. A spokesman there had been fewer than 10 arrests, for breaches of coronavirus restrictions and the ban on Nazi symbols. Meanwhile, a few hundred protesters gathered in Amsterdam today and a similar number marched through the southern city of Breda over the latest Covid-19 measures. Riots also erupted in the central 'Bible Belt' town of Urk and cities in southern Limburg province, while angry fans disrupted two football matches being played behind closed doors because of coronavirus rules, Dutch media . It comes after violent riots last night in which 51 were arrested in Rotterdam after thousands of anti-lockdown protesters gathered on one of the city's main shopping streets. Dutch police fired water canons, 'warning shots' and bullets at protesters to disperse the crowd who had lit fires and set off fireworks. Police confirmed seven injuries, including officers, in the violence but did not if live ammunition or rubber bullets were fired. The Netherlands re-imposed some lockdown measures last weekend for an initial three weeks in an effort to slow a resurgence of coronavirus contagion, but daily infections have remained at their highest levels since the start of the pandemic. The Dutch government has it wants to introduce a law that would allow businesses to restrict the country's coronavirus pass system to only people who are fully vaccinated or have recovered from Covid-19 - that would exclude people who test negative. The violent scenes in Rotterdam mirrored much of the continent's reaction to similar schemes announced by Austria, Germany, the Czech Republic, and Slovakia - with Italy and Greece also reportedly considering moves to restrict the movements of unvaccinated people.

The lockdown, which comes into effect on Monday, constitutes the toughest restrictions introduced in Europe in recent weeks as Covid-19 cases surge continent-wide, fuelled by vaccine resistance. Austrians will not be allowed to leave home except to go to work, shop for essentials and exercise. The restrictions will initially last 20 days with an evaluation after 10 days, Chancellor Alexander Schallenberg . Vaccination against Covid-19 in the Alpine nation will be mandatory from February 1 next year, Schallenberg . So far, the Vatican alone in Europe has imposed a vaccination mandate. The World Health Organization continues to favour policies that 'demonstrate the benefit and safety of vaccines for the greatest possible acceptance of vaccines, rather than imposed mandatory vaccination,' spokeswoman Fadela Chaib told reporters in Geneva. Austria has already imposed movement restrictions on those not vaccinated or recently recovered from the virus, ordering them to stay at home since Monday, becoming the first EU country to do so. But infections have continued to rise. On Friday, a new record of more than 15,800 new cases was recorded in the EU member of nearly nine million people. Reporting by AFP Advertisement Austrians are protesting against a new national lockdown and mandatory vaccinations, which the government yesterday would be rolled out on February 1. Vaccinations in Austria have plateaued at one of the lowest rates in Western Europe - under 66 per cent - and hospitals in heavily hit states have warned that their intensive care units are reaching capacity. Austrian Chancellor Alexander Schallenberg yesterday the country would go in lockdown for 10 days. The shutdown will then reevaluated and could be extended for a further 10 days. Most stores will close, and cultural events will be canceled. People will be able to leave their homes only for certain specific reasons, including buying groceries, going to the doctor or exercising. Average daily deaths have tripled in recent weeks and its infections are among the highest in Europe, with a seven-day incidence of 991 per 100,000 people. 'We have not succeeded in convincing enough people to get vaccinated,' Chancellor Alexander Schallenberg told a news conference. 'It hurts that such measures still have to be taken.' Schallenberg also apologised to all vaccinated people on Friday night saying it was not fair they had to suffer under the renewed lockdown restrictions when they had done everything to help contain the virus. 'I'm sorry to take this drastic step,' he on public broadcaster ORF. Despite the violence a day earlier, around 300 protesters marched through the southern Dutch town of Breda near the Belgian border on Saturday carrying banners with slogans such as 'No Lockdown'. Organisers they opposed Prime Minister Mark Rutte's plans to exclude the unvaccinated from bars and restaurants. A group that had called an Amsterdam protest for Saturday, United We Stand Europe, on Facebook it had cancelled the rally because 'last night, all hell broke loose in Rotterdam'.

Local news outlet NL Times reported that a journalist was attacked of the street, while local broadcaster Rijnmond the reporter was beaten and his camera was destroyed. Local media also reported gangs of soccer hooligans were involved in the rioting. One eyewitness - a press photographer – told local media they saw shell casings 'everywhere on the floor'. Cops also it was 'unclear how or by whom' two people were shot during the chaos. Video from social media on Dutch broadcaster NOS appeared to show the person being hit in Rotterdam, but there was no explanation on what happened. Officers arrested 51 protesters last night and were expected to detain several more after studying video footage from security cameras. Late on Friday night, police downtown Rotterdam remained restive and there was still a heavy police presence on the streets. Mayor Ahmed Aboutaleb told reporters in the early hours of Saturday morning that 'on a number of occasions the police felt it necessary to draw their weapons to defend themselves' as rioters ran rampage through the port city's central shopping district, setting fires and throwing rocks and fireworks at officers. 'They shot at protesters, people were injured,' Aboutaleb , adding that several officers were injured in the violence. Police spokesperson Patricia Wessels confirmed that police fired shots, though it was not immediately clear what type of rounds were fired. 'We fired warning shots and there were also direct shots fired because the situation was life-threatening,' she . 'We know that at least two people were wounded, probably as a result of the warning shots, but we need to investigate the exact causes further.'

Professor John Edmund today that opposition to stringent restrictions on the continent have demonstrated the importance of booster jabs, warning, 'it is pretty clear immunity does wane'. 'What you see now in central Europe with these rapid increase in cases, you see the importance of vaccination,' Mr Edmund told Sky. But Mr Edmund the UK was unlikely to be hit by the Christmas chaos because the country 'is in a slightly different position.' He added: 'Frankly here in the UK, we've had high rates of infection for many months now so we're in a slightly different position to Austria and Germany and so on. 'I don't think things will quite happen in the same way here as they have done there. But it is a warning to us. I think it's pretty clear that immunity does wane. 'I'm sure you do still have some protection from the vaccine but it's nowhere near as strong as shortly after you've been vaccinated. It's very clear the booster doses do give a very clear boost to your immune system.' Asked whether the Government should re-introduce control measures, Mr Edmund told Sky: 'The plan B measures, we could've implemented them at any point. It's a government decision whether to take that step. 'They have to look at the potential effectiveness and measure that against the potential cost of some of those things.' Advertisement Riot police carrying shields and batons were directing groups of people away from the area. Officers on horseback and in police vans patrolled the streets. Police also cordoned off several scenes to comb for evidence, with a human finger visible on the ground at one of them, the AFP correspondent . 'Most of the demonstrators are now gone. There only remain a few groups in a few places,' police spokesman Jesse Brobbel told AFP. Dutch justice minister Ferd Grapperhaus in a statement that the 'extreme violence' against police and fire fighters in Rotterdam was 'repulsive'. 'The right to protest is very important in our society but what we saw last night was simply criminal behaviour,' Grapperhaus . Dutch police units from around the country were brought in to 'restore order' to Rotterdam. 'Dozens of arrests have now been made, it is expected that more arrests will follow. Around seven people have been injured, including on the side of the police,' a police statement . At least one police car was set on fire during the protest, a police spokesman confirmed to AFP. The spokesperson could not confirm the number of people injured. Several electric scooters and other items were also torched, with several hundred protesters involved in the riots, images on Dutch media and social media showed. Local authorities issued an emergency order banning people from gathering in the area in a bid to prevent further violence, and the authorities also called on bystanders and people who recorded images of the riots to send the footage to police for further investigation. Police tweeted that rioters started fires and threw fireworks during the rioting and authorities closed the city's main railway station. The several hundred people had gathered to voice opposition to government plans to restrict access to indoor venues to people who have a 'corona pass' showing they have been vaccinated or already recovered from an infection. The pass is also available to people who have not been vaccinated, but have proof of a negative test. 'This is a very serious situation which requires action with the highest priority,' the emergency order by the Rotterdam municipality. 'It is therefore necessary to issue this emergency order so as to maintain public order and to protect the safety of persons.'

It announced that the daily tally jumped to 22,936 on Friday, almost 500 more than the previous record set on Tuesday. The country's infection rate has risen to 929 new cases per 100,000 residents over the past seven days. In a worrying sign, 110 people died on Thursday, the ministry , with the daily death toll surpassing 100 for the first time since April. The government has approved new restrictions to tackle the surge, targeting the unvaccinated in an effort to increase a vaccination rate that is below the European Union average. Starting on Monday, most unvaccinated people will no longer be allowed to show negative coronavirus tests in order to attend public events, go to bars and restaurants, visit hairdressers, museums and similar facilities or use hotels. Only people who are vaccinated or have recovered from Covid-19 will remain eligible. Overall, the nation of 10.7 million has registered almost two million cases with 32,005 deaths. Advertisement Local political party Leefbaar Rotterdam condemned the violence in a tweet. 'The centre of our beautiful city has this evening transformed into a war zone,' it . 'Rotterdam is a city where you can disagree with things that happen but violence is never, never, the solution.' Like much of the rest of Europe, the Netherlands has seen Covid cases soar to record levels in recent days, with more than 21,000 new infections reported on Friday. The latest restrictions were announced on November 12, and sparked clashes between demonstrators and police outside the justice ministry in The Hague. The restrictions came into force the following day, shuttering bars, restaurants, cafes and supermarkets at 8:00 pm daily, while non-essential shops must shut at 6:00 pm. People are limited to having four visitors at home and have been advised to work at home unless absolutely necessary. Public events have been scrapped while football matches must be played behind closed doors. Schools however remain open, and people are allowed to leave their homes without restrictions. The Dutch government has it will review the situation on December 3. It is considering excluding the unvaccinated from bars and restaurants, limiting admittance to people who have been vaccinated or who have recovered from the disease, but there was significant opposition to the plan during a debate in parliament this week. The Netherlands suffered its worst riots in four decades in January after a night-time Covid curfew, the country's first since World War II, came into force. Earlier Friday, the government banned fireworks on Dec. 31 for the second straight year. The ban is intended 'to prevent, as much as possible, extra strain on health care, law enforcement and first responders,' the government Friday. The riots in Rotterdam come after Austria on Friday that it will become the first country in western Europe to reimpose a full Covid-19 lockdown, while neighbouring Germany warned it may follow suit, sending shivers through financial markets worried about the economic fallout. Restrictions have also been placed on the unvaccinated in Germany – where they have been banned from restaurants – as well as in the Czech Republic and Slovakia.

'The situation is very, very serious and difficult,' Markus Soeder, premier of the southern state of Bavaria, as he also announced a shutdown of clubs, bars and night service at restaurants. The eastern state of Saxony unveiled similar measures and went even further by closing all sporting and cultural venues, banning tourism, public consumption of alcohol and barring the unvaccinated from non-essential shops and hairdressers. Saxony premier Michael Kretschmer - whose state has Germany's lowest vaccination rate at just under 60 percent of the population - admitted that many of the restrictions would affect the vaccinated as well. But he tough action was needed to keep hospitals from being overwhelmed and called for 'solidarity' from all citizens. 'We need more 'we' and less 'I' in this pandemic,' he told reporters. Bavaria and Saxony are among the hardest hit regions in the ferocious fourth Covid wave sweeping Germany. Reporting by AFP Advertisement Following the announcement, Freedom Party leader Herbert Kickl posted a picture on Facebook with the inscription: 'As of today Austria is a dictatorship.' The party is planning a protest on Saturday, but Kickl cannot attend because he has tested positive for Covid-19 and must self-isolate for 14 days. Europe has again become the epicentre of the pandemic, accounting for half of global cases and deaths, the WHO . A fourth wave of infections has plunged Germany, Europe's largest economy, into a national emergency, Health Minister Jens Spahn , warning that vaccinations alone will not cut case numbers. Both decisions infuriated many in a country where scepticism about state mandates affecting individual freedoms runs high, encouraged by the far-right Freedom Party, the third biggest in parliament. Asked if Germany could rule out an Austrian-style full lockdown, Spahn : 'We are now in a situation - even if this produces a news alert - where we can't rule anything out. 'We are in a national emergency,' he told a news conference. Looming lockdowns weighed on a range of financial market sectors on Friday, pushing stocks and oil down and boosting the dollar. 'We expect targeted measures (against COVID-19) across some countries mainly according to the health situation, but other factors, such as domestic political situations, will be relevant,' Oxford Economics analysts in a note. 'And while it might take a while before a political consensus can be reached in other countries, it is clear that the tide has turned.' As cases rise again, a number of European governments have started to reimpose limits on activity, ranging from Austria's full lockdown to a partial lockdown in the Netherlands and restrictions on the unvaccinated in parts of Germany, the Czech Republic and Slovakia. Niels Van Regenmortel, the intensive care units coordinator at the ZNA Stuivenberg hospital in Antwerp, there was an increasing risk hospitals in Belgium will have to resort to triage as ICUs fill up amid soaring COVID-19 numbers, calling on the government to restrict night life.

It reveals that Sweden is in the bottom half of countries for vaccine uptake, but ahead of nations including the UK and Germany Europe has become the epicentre of the pandemic once again, with the World Health Organisation warning that the Continent was the only region in the world where deaths had increased - with Covid-related fatalities spiking by five per cent just this week What Covid restrictions are in place in Sweden? The country- which dodged a lockdown unlike most other nations - also has next to no Covid restrictions in place. It dropped its final measures recommending people to work from home where possible on September 29. And advice for people to wear face masks on public transport was abandoned on July. Unlike in other countries the coverings were never compulsory. On November 11 Swedish health authorities went even further telling double-vaccinated people they no longer needed to swab themselves for the virus. But this move has now been reversed after critics it left the country in a dangerous position just before winter. Some travel restrictions are still in place for people coming to the country from non-EU nations and Britain. All arrivals are required to show a certificate they have been double-vaccinated. When this is not possible they are asked to show a negative Covid test result from to come to the country from non-EU countries. All arrivals are also required to prove they up to 48 hours before they travelled. Sweden will impose further restrictions from December 1 requiring everyone attending events of more than 100 people to show proof they are double-vaccinated. Officials have warned more Covid restrictions may be needed this winter. Advertisement Whether or not countries opt to lock down again depends on a wide range of factors, including vaccination rates, mask mandates and the extent to which booster shots are being made available. Germany has further measures will be decided based on when hospitalisation rates hit certain thresholds, while Friday saw its first states - Saxony and Bavaria - cancel all their Christmas markets. The Bavarian state capital of Munich on Tuesday had become the first major German city to cancel its Christmas market for the second year in a row. Saxony's cancellations means the famed Dresden Christmas market is also scrapped. Germany hosts some 2,500 Christmas markets each year, cherished by visitors who come to savour mulled wine and roasted chestnuts, and shop for seasonal trinkets among clusters of wooden chalets. In pre-pandemic times, they drew about 160 million domestic and international visitors annually who brought in revenues of three to five billion euros ($3.4 billion to $5.6 billion), according to the BSM stallkeepers' industry association. In France, President Emmanuel Macron has made it clear he thinks high levels of vaccinations should be enough to avoid future lockdowns. Britain, with higher numbers of infections than most countries in Europe, is rolling out third shots - or boosters - to offset waning protection from the first two and help keep the economy open. While the new measures across Europe are not seen hitting the economy as much as the all-out lockdowns of last year, analysts they could weigh on the recovery in the last quarter, especially if they hurt the retail and hospitality sectors over Christmas. A full lockdown in Germany would be more serious, however. 'With Germany ... imposing new restrictions, any thoughts that the vaccines would offer a way to a more normal Christmas period appear to have gone up in smoke for now, in Europe at least,' Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK. 'Although there is a nagging fear this could ripple out across the region.' The pressure on intensive care units in Germany has not yet reached its peak, Spahn , urging people to reduce contacts to help break the wave. 'How Christmas will turn out, I dare not . I can only it's up to us,' he added.

A couple hug and laugh as they have lunch in a restaurant in Stockholm, Sweden EU issues advice on using Covid-19 pill for adults The European Union's drug regulator has issued advice on using Merck's COVID-19 pill for adults and began a review of a rival tablet from Pfizer to help member states decide on quick adoption ahead of any formal EU-wide approval. In two separate statements on Friday, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) detailed efforts to advance use of the experimental but promising options, as infections and COVID-related deaths are rapidly rising in the region and forcing renewed lockdowns. Merck's COVID-19 tablet, Lagevrio, developed with Ridgeback Biotherapeutics, should be given early and within five days of first symptoms to treat adults who do not need oxygen support and are at risk of their disease worsening. It advised against treatment during pregnancy and for women who plan to or could get pregnant, while adding that breastfeeding must also be stopped around the time of using the pill, which is to be taken twice a day for five days. Drugs in the same class as Merck's Lagevrio have been linked to birth defects in animal studies. The drugmaker, known as MSD outside the United States and Canada, has animal testing shows its pill is safe, but the data have not been made public. EMA it was studying available data on the Pfizer pill Paxlovid, days after the drugmaker sought U.S. approval, adding that a more comprehensive rolling review was expected to start ahead of any approval. It did not specify when that review would be. The EMA last month began a rolling review of the Merck pill and expects to conclude that evaluation by the end of the year. Advertisement Chancellor Angela Merkel on Thursday Germany will limit large parts of public life in areas where hospitals are becoming dangerously full of COVID-19 patients to those who have either been vaccinated or have recovered from the illness. 'It's clear from our experience in England and from what's happening across Europe that while vaccines do a lot of the heavy lifting ... other interventions are required to prevent case numbers rising,' Lawrence Young, virologist and professor of molecular oncology at the University of Warwick. 'Less mask wearing, more mixing indoors due to colder weather and waning immunity are also contributing to the high case levels across Europe.' Sweden, meanwhile, has the lowest Covid infection rate in western Europe — after double-vaccinated nationals were told they don't have to test for the virus even if they get symptoms. The Scandinavian nation — which was subject to international scrutiny last year when it refused to lockdown — is currently recording 85.4 cases per million people, according to Oxford University research site Our World in Data. By comparison, the rate is nearly 1,400 per million in Europe's current Covid capital Austria, which today announced it is going back into a full lockdown from Monday. Sweden's infection rate is far lower than other Western European countries like the Netherlands (1,048.7), Britain (581), Germany (536), and France (201). And for the first time in the pandemic, Sweden is recording fewer cases per population size than its Scandinavian neighbours Denmark (655), Norway (351) and Finland (150). But critics Sweden has been left 'in the dark' over the true extent of its coronavirus wave because the double-vaccinated, equivalent to almost seven in ten people, are not being routinely swabbed. Last week, Sweden broke ranks with its European neighbours once again and told Swedes they did not have to get tested if they were fully jabbed, even if they had symptoms. Covid swabbing rates plunged 35 per cent last week, compared to a month earlier. But this week the policy was reversed in response to rising cases on the continent. A fresh wave of Delta is rolling across the continent and putting pressure on hospitals once again, which has forced most in the EU to bring back some form of curbs. Latest figures show Sweden is only carrying out 1.26 tests per 1,000 people, which is also the lowest number in western Europe. The threat of fresh lockdowns comes as optimism grows about experimental drugs developed by Pfizer and Merck that cut the chance of hospitalisation and severe illness, more weapons in the world's fight against the virus. On Friday, the EU drug regulator it was reviewing data on Pfizer's COVID-19 pill to help member states decide on quick adoption ahead of any formal EU-wide approval. Slovakia has also seen a surge in infections, with 9,171 reported on Friday, its biggest daily tally since the pandemic began. The country of 5.5 million earlier in the week tightened restrictions on people who have not had COVID-19 shots. With a seven-day incidence of 11,500 new cases per million inhabitants, the country has the worst reported epidemic situation in the world, according to Our World in Data statistics."", ""Europe descended into a third day of violent carnage on Sunday as tens of thousands of people in Belgium took to the streets to protest against the return of strict lockdown rules aimed at curbing a rise in Covid infections. Nearly 40,000 people descended on the capital Brussels to protest against new anti-Covid measures banning the unvaccinated from entering restaurants and bars. Some protesters were seen throwing projectiles at riot police and in response, officers fired water cannon and tear gas at the group. Police have made some arrests, but it is not immediately clear how many. Video footage from Brussels shows a large group of protesters shouting at police as some light flares and throw them at the officers. One man can even be seen mooning at them. The protests descended into chaos, with some of the protesters seen setting fires on the streets while others threw rocks through the windows of local businesses including a post office. Two police cars have also been damaged. The protest came just hours after it emerged Germany is set to follow Austria's example in making vaccinations compulsory with ministers admitting that the move is 'unavoidable' amid a fourth wave of the pandemic which is crippling the country's hospitals. Last night also saw similar demonstrations against virus restrictions take place in Austria, Switzerland, Croatia, Italy, Northern Ireland, Austria and North Macedonia on Saturday, a day after Dutch police opened fire on protesters and seven people were injured in rioting that erupted in Rotterdam. Europe has become the epicentre of the pandemic once again, with the World Health Organisation warning that the Continent was the only region in the world where deaths had increased as Covid-related fatalities spiked by five per cent just this week. In France, the government has warned that the fifth wave of coronavirus are rising at 'lightning speed', with new daily Covid cases close to doubling over the past week. In Belgium, cases have been surging, with infections reaching 13,836 on Sunday. In response, the government has introduced restrictions including a ban on the unvaccinated from venues such as restaurants and bars, and an order to work from home at least four days a week. Police 35,000 protesters marched from the North Station in Brussels on Sunday afternoon against a fresh round of Covid measures announced by the government on Wednesday. The demonstration, called 'Together for Freedom', saw some protesters clash with riot police near the Belgian capital's EU and government district. Many of the protesters caught up in the clash were wearing hoods and carried Flemish nationalist flags. A total of 42 people were detained and two were arrested in the riots. Meanwhile, three police officers were injured and taken to hospital and one protester was hurt after a firework exploded in his hand.

Several police officers were injured after protesters threw bottles and fireworks at them. Last week, Belgium's Prime Minister Last week, Belgium's Prime Minister Alexander De Croo 'the alarm signals are all red' as he imposed tough restrictions, ordering people to work at home for at least four days a week. Under new restrictions, all people in indoor venues such as cafes and restaurants will need to wear a mask unless seated and the rule will apply to those aged 10 or older. The previous age threshold was 12. Nightclubs may have to test their guests if they want to let them dance mask-free. People wanting to eat in a restaurant or go to the theatre already must present a COVID pass, showing vaccination, a negative test or recent recovery. Most Belgians will also have to work from home four days a week until mid-December, and for three days after that. Belgium has one of the highest cases per capita rates in the European Union, behind only the Baltic and former Yugoslav nations and Austria, at around one per hundred people over the past 14 days, according to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control. 'The alarm signals are all red,' prime minister Alexander De Croo told a news conference. 'We had all hoped to have a winter without coronavirus, but Belgium is not an island.' Niels Van Regenmortel, the intensive care units coordinator at the ZNA Stuivenberg hospital in Antwerp, there was an increasing risk hospitals in Belgium will have to resort to triage as ICUs fill up amid soaring COVID-19 numbers, calling on the government to restrict night life. In Germany, the number of Covid cases are soaring daily, with the country reporting 48,201 infections on Saturday - the highest number of new coronavirus cases since the beginning of the pandemic. The fourth wave is overwhelming hospitals, with health chiefs warning that the situation is 'extremely critical' across the country. In France, fifth-wave coronavirus infections are rising at an alarming rate, the government reported Sunday, with new daily Covid cases close to doubling over the past week. In Germany, a relatively low vaccination rate - hovering under 70 per cent - has left the country vulnerable to the virus. Germany's federal tourism commissioner Thomas Bareiß has now the worsening situation makes it clear that compulsory vaccination is 'unavoidable'. Bareiß told DPA news agency: 'In retrospect, it was wrong not to see that right from the start. The hope at that time is understandable, but it was not realistic.' His calls were echoed by the Prime Minister of Bavaria, which has seen Covid cases surge, who 'in the end we will not be able to avoid compulsory vaccination'.

Pictured: Protesters in Brussels on Sunday Riot police raise their shields as they clash with protesters on a bridge in Brussels on Sunday during anti-vaccine demonstrations Thousands of protesters, many of them peaceful, marched through the streets of Brussels on Sunday. Some held signs which read 'Stand up for your rights' and 'Stop the madness' Mr Bareiß, the tourism commissioner of Germany's federal government, a compulsory vaccination is 'unavoidable'. Putin tells Russia he had Covid booster jab Russian President Vladimir Putin on Sunday he had taken a third dose of a Covid vaccine, as the country struggled with a fresh wave of the virus. 'I had it two hours ago,' Putin on state television channel Rossiya 24, assuring viewers that his booster injection of the Sputnik vaccine had been painless. The authorities are struggling to convince people to get vaccinated against Covid, even as a fresh wave of the virus is killing record numbers every day. Even though Russia has several vaccines that it has manufactured itself, only 36.7 percent of the population is fully vaccinated, according to the Gogov website, which tracks the data. Putin, who he opposes universal mandatory vaccination, has backed measures taken in some regions for certain people. For example, in June, authorities in Moscow vaccination would be obligatory for anyone working in the service sector. Russia recorded more than 9.3 million cases of Covid and just over 264,000 deaths, which makes it the worst-hit country in Europe. The actual toll from the pandemic there was closer to 450,000 at the end of September, according to figures from the Rosstat statistics agency however, which works with a broader definition of Covid-linked deaths. Advertisement He : 'For me it is politically no longer justifiable that entire industries, retailers, restaurants, clubs, bars and the entire cinema, cultural and event scene live in a state of crisis prescribed by the state for 20 months and are faced with great existential fears, while others are concerned take the freedom not to vaccinate. 'So far, historical measures and sums of money have been able to save many companies. That doesn't work in the long run.' In Bavaria, there has been a 'dramatic' coronavirus resurgence. It prompted the Bavarian state capital of Munich to become the first major German city to cancel its Christmas market, which usually draws some three million visitors. The Bavarian Prime Minister Markus Söder he believes the country will 'not be able to avoid' compulsory vaccination. He told Berliner Zeitung: 'I believe that in the end we will not be able to avoid compulsory vaccination. Otherwise it will be an endless loop with this coronavirus.' The director of Frankfurt University Hospital the situation in intensive care units in the state of Hesse is 'critical'. Jürgen Graf, who is also the head of the planning staff for the inpatient care of Covid patients in Hesse at the Ministry of Health, told Bild: 'The situation is extremely critical. What we are currently doing is crisis management.' He added: 'This is not a problem for Covid patients, it affects everyone,' explaining that inpatient care and the care of emergency patients are 'impaired' due to longer wait times. The warning comes as a hospital in Bavaria's Freising last week made the unprecedented decision to transfer a Covid-19 patient to northern Italy because it 'had no more capacity to receive them, and the surrounding hospitals were also full.' Almost one per cent of the new infections end up in the intensive care unit, Graf . 'Given the current number of infections, that would be 50 or more patients per week in addition to the approximately 250 patients treated there today,' he added. 'Then in a few weeks we will be well above last winter's high.' The fourth wave is overwhelming hospitals, with health chiefs warning that the situation is 'extremely critical' across the country. Pictured: Doctors and nurses tend to a patient on the Covid-19 intensive care unit at University Hospital Leipzig on November 18 THE NETHERLANDS: A day after Rotterdam rioting that saw seven people injured, thousands more took to Amsterdam's central Dam Square and The Hague (pictured above), with seven arrests being made according to police AUSTRIA: Protesters carrying a banner reading 'Control the border. Not your people' at the anti-lockdown demonstration held by the far-right Freedom Party in Vienna today The fourth wave of infections has plunged Germany, Europe's largest economy, into a national emergency, Health Minister Jens Spahn . He urged people to reduce their social contacts, warning that vaccinations alone would not reduce case numbers. Asked if Germany could rule out an Austrian-style full lockdown, Spahn : 'We are now in a situation - even if this produces a news alert - where we can't rule anything out. 'We are in a national emergency,' he told a news conference. Their comments come after the upper house of parliament on Friday approved new measures to control the outbreak proposed by the centre-left alliance that emerged after the September 26 national election. Three people treated in hospital and inquiry launched after Dutch police fired warning shots during Rotterdam riots Three people were being treated in hospital in Rotterdam on Saturday after they were seriously injured when Dutch police fired shots during a violent protest against COVID-19 measures, authorities . Crowds of several hundred rioters torched cars, set off fireworks and threw rocks at police during the protests on Friday evening. Police responded with warning shots and water canons. Rotterdam police posted on Twitter on Saturday that 51 people had been arrested, half of whom were under 18. 'Three rioters were wounded when they were hit by bullets, they remain in hospital,' police added, in an update after earlier reporting two wounded. Authorities are investigating the shootings including whether the wounded people where hit by police bullets, they added. The city's mayor, Ahmed Aboutaleb, the protest had turned into 'an orgy of violence.' 'Police were forced to draw their weapons and even fire direct shots,' he told a news conference early on Saturday. Dutch Justice Minister Ferd Grapperhaus in a statement the 'extreme violence' against police and firefighters in Rotterdam was 'repulsive.' 'The right to protest is very important in our society but what we saw last night was simply criminal behaviour,' Grapperhaus . Protesters had gathered to voice opposition to government plans to restrict access to indoor venues to people who have a 'corona pass,' showing they have been vaccinated or have already recovered from an infection. The pass is also available to people who have not been vaccinated, but have proof of a negative test. Advertisement The measures include requirements for people to prove they are vaccinated, recently recovered from Covid-19 or have tested negative for the virus in order to access communal workplaces or public transport. Separately, outgoing Chancellor Angela Merkel agreed with the governors of Germany's 16 states to introduce a new threshold linked to the number of hospital admissions of Covid-19 patients per 100,000 people over a seven-day period. The new three-tier system would require people to show evidence of a vaccination or previous infection to enter public buildings or businesses in states where hospitalisation rates go above 3 in 100,000 people, based on a seven-day average. At present, that will affect 9 of Germany's 16 states. In France, the seven-day average of new cases reached 17,153 on Saturday, up from 9,458 a week earlier, according to the health authorities, an increase of 81 percent. 'The fifth wave is starting at lightning speed,' government spokesman Gabrial Attal . The latest seven-day increase is three times the average rise of cases recorded over the previous three weeks, indicating an exponential acceleration of infections. For now the spike in infections has not led to a massive influx of Covid patients into hospitals, with the authorities attributing the limited number of intensive care patients to France's high rate of vaccinations which appear highly effective against the most dangerous forms of Covid. On Saturday, hospitals reported a total of 7,974 Covid patients in their care, with 1,333 of them in intensive treatment. This compares to 6,500 and 1,000, respectively, a month earlier. 'There is a very strong increase in infections, but we also know that in France we have a very large vaccination cover,' he . 'We seem to be ahead of our neighbours concerning booster shots.' France's introduction of a health pass ahead of other countries in the summer was also helping to keep Covid in check, he . The health pass, required in French restaurants, cafes and many cultural venues, certifies that a person is fully vaccinated, has recently recovered from Covid, or has tested negative for the virus. The government continues to stand by its choice to 'bring the weight of restrictions to bear on non-vaccinated people rather than vaccinated people', Attal Last night, Europe descended into a second night of violent carnage amid the return of strict lockdown rules aimed at curbing rising rates of Covid infection. Thousands of people took to Amsterdam's central Dam Square and the Hague on Saturday, a day after the 'orgy of violence' during the Rotterdam riots that saw seven people injured. Police seven arrests were made on Sunday after youths set streets ablaze and shot fireworks at officers. Video footage from the Hague showed motorists sounding their horns in support as a trio of small explosions could be clearly seen on the main road in the background. Elsewhere, protesters were pictured ripping down street signs in chaotic scenes. Anti-riot police were forced to clear the wreckage of smouldering scooters and burnt-out bicycles that were torched by the anti-vax mob and left to block roads in one of the worst outbreaks of violence in the country since Covid restrictions were first implemented. Meanwhile, similar demonstrations against virus restrictions also took place in Switzerland, Croatia, Italy, Northern Ireland, Austria and North Macedonia on Saturday, a day after Dutch police opened fire on protesters and seven people were injured in rioting that erupted in Rotterdam. It comes as violence broke out in Vienna on Saturday as 10,000 protesters - many from far-right groups - took to the streets to demonstrate against new Covid-19 restrictions and mandatory vaccinations. Police were pictured arresting two protesters. A spokesman there had been fewer than 10 arrests, for breaches of coronavirus restrictions and the ban on Nazi symbols. Some protesters mockingly wore doctor's scrubs, while others wore the yellow stars as badges in reference to Nazi Germany's policy of forcing Jews to wear the badge as identification. Chanting 'resistance!', waving Austrian flags and blowing whistles, the crowd swelled to more than 30,000. Many held signs mocking government leaders including Chancellor Alexander Schallenberg and Health Minister Wolfgang Mueckstein. Protesters rallied against coronavirus restrictions and mandatory COVID-19 passes needed in many European countries to enter restaurants, Christmas markets or sports events, as well as mandatory vaccinations. The Austrian protest, which was promoted by the far-right opposition Freedom Party, became violent and five police officers were injured - a development which Austria's Interior Minister Karl Nehammer slammed as 'unacceptable'. Nehammer told a press conference on Sunday morning: 'If at a meeting that is organised and promoted by a parliamentary party, where police officers are attacked and Nazi crimes are played down by wearing the Jewish star, that is unacceptable.' The protesters had worn the yellow Jewish star as badges, with the words 'unvaccinated' stitched on, as they compared the lockdown and mandatory vaccination measures with the atrocities of the Nazi era. Nehammer : 'This is not only completely tasteless, it plays down the crimes of the National Socialists and offends the millions of victims of the Nazi dictatorship and their families.' The interior minister some of the protesters were from right-wing extremist groups, with some setting fire to a police car and confessing that they 'wanted to burn a police officer'. 'This is an extent of radicalisation that is by no means acceptable,' Nehammer , adding that the police officers 'professionally ensured security in a difficult mission'. AUSTRIA: Thousands of residents - one holding a sign reading 'no to mandatory vaccination' - today gathered in Vienna to demonstrate against new Covid restrictions amid soaring infection rates across the continent In Italy, 3,000 turned out in the capital's Circus Maximus, a field where in ancient times Romans staged popular entertainment, to protest against 'Green Pass' certificates required at workplaces, restaurants, cinemas, theaters, sports venues and gyms, as well as for long-distance train, bus or ferry travel within Italy. In Northern Ireland, several hundred people opposed to vaccine passports protested outside the city hall in Belfast, where the city's Christmas market opened Saturday - a market where proof of vaccination or a negative COVID-19 test was required. The Northern Ireland government voted this week to introduce vaccine certificates for admission to nightclubs, bars and restaurants starting Dec. 13. 'People like us never give up,' read one banner, in the red, white and green colors of the Italian flag. Virtually no one at the Rome protest wore a protective mask. Switzerland saw 2,000 people protest an upcoming referendum on whether to approve the government's COVID-19 restrictions law, claiming it was discriminatory, public broadcaster SRF reported. In Croatia, thousands gathered at in the capital Zagreb, carrying Croatian flags, nationalist and religious symbols, along with banners against vaccination and what they describe as restrictions of people's freedoms. And in Denmark, more than one thousand gathered outside the Danish parliament in Copenhagen to push back against the reintroduction of the national health pass. North Macedonia also saw hundreds of anti-vaccination protesters march in downtown Skopje on Satruday evening against the country's health authority's recommendation of mandatory vaccinations. Demonstrations against virus measures are also expected in other European countries - the latest in rising anger at the re-introduction of restrictions amid soaring cases on the continent. This comes as the World Health Organization (WHO) it was 'very worried' about the spread of Covid-19 within Europe as the continent battles a fresh wave of infections. Regional director Dr Hans Kluge told the BBC that some 500,000 more deaths could be recorded by March unless urgent action is taken.

The island's prefect on Friday introduced the night-time stay-at-home order after protests against the coronavirus vaccine pass spiralled into violence the previous night. But the measure did little to quell the rioting. 'The night was very turbulent,' a police source . The security forces recorded 'some 20 incidents of looting or attempted robbery' in the seaside towns of Pointe-a-Pitre and Le Gosier, including at a jewellery shop, a bank, a betting shop and a shopping centre. In the town of Saint-Francois to the east, 'gendarmes coming out of the station were threatened by blazing projectiles'. A second source within the gendarmerie an armoury had been looted. The first source 'firearms were used against police forces in four different areas' across the island, and one member was slightly wounded after a stone hit him in the face. In the area of Le Petit-Bourg to the west, firemen had to put out fires in two mobile phone stores, which had also been plundered. The interior ministry 31 people had been arrested. France late Saturday it was sending around 50 personnel from both its RAID elite police force and its GIGN counter-terrorism unit to Guadeloupe. The doctors' union in Guadeloupe warned against further trouble while the health system was so 'fragile'. They criticised 'individuals who may have prevented patients from getting access to treatment, or medical staff from reaching their place of practice'. While most people in mainland France have now received two vaccination doses, rates in its overseas territories have lagged behind. By November 16, some 46 percent of adults in Guadeloupe had received at least one jab of a vaccine against Covid. Advertisement Five police officers were injured during rioting at the Hague, with one taken to hospital suffering concussion and two suffering hearing damage from loud fireworks,. A rock thrown by rioters also smashed the window of a passing ambulance carrying a patient, the city's police force . Elsewhere in the Netherlands, two football matches in the Eredivise, the top professional league, were briefly halted after fans - banned from matches under a partial lockdown in force in the Netherlands for a week - broke into stadiums in the towns of Alkmaar and Almelo. Earlier Saturday, two protests against COVID-19 measures went off peacefully in Amsterdam and the southern city of Breda. Police in a tweet that seven people were arrested in The Hague and five officers were injured. One needed treatment in a hospital. Local media reported that rioters threw bicycles, wooden pallets and motorized scooters on one of the fires. The chaos in The Hague was on a smaller scale than the pitched battles on the streets of Rotterdam on Friday night, when police that three rioters were hit by bullets and investigations were underway to establish if they were shot by police. Officers in Rotterdam arrested 51 people, about half of them minors, police Saturday afternoon. One police officer was hospitalized with a leg injury sustained in the rioting, another was treated by ambulance staff and 'countless' others suffered minor injuries. Mayor Ahmed Aboutaleb told reporters in the early hours of Saturday morning that 'on a number of occasions the police felt it necessary to draw their weapons to defend themselves' as rioters rampaged through the port city's central shopping district, setting fires and throwing rocks and fireworks at officers. 'They shot at protesters, people were injured,' Aboutaleb . He did not have details on the injuries. Police also fired warning shots. Justice Minister Ferd Grapperhaus condemned the events. 'The riots and extreme violence against police officers, riot police and firefighters last night in Rotterdam are disgusting to see,' he in a statement. 'Protesting is a great right in our society, but what we saw last night is simply criminal behavior. It has nothing to do with demonstrating,' he added. An independent investigation into the shootings by police was opened, as is the case whenever Dutch police use their weapons. As the march kicked off on Vienna's Heldenplatz, thousands of protesters gathered on the massive square. About 1,300 police officers were on duty. They used loudspeakers to tell protesters masks were required, but most did not wear them. Chanting 'resistance!' and blowing whistles, protesters began to move slowly down the city's inner ring road. Many waved Austrian flags and carried signs mocking government leaders like Chancellor Alexander Schallenberg and Health Minister Wolfgang Mueckstein. Some wore doctor's scrubs; others donned tinfoil hats. Most of the signs focused on the newly announced vaccine mandate: 'My Body, My Choice,' read one. 'We're Standing Up for Our Kids!' another. By mid-afternoon the crowds had swelled to roughly 35,000 people, according to the police, and were marching down Vienna's inner ring road before heading back towards the Hofburg. Police were pictured arresting two protesters. A spokesman there had been fewer than 10 arrests, for breaches of coronavirus restrictions and the ban on Nazi symbols. Meanwhile, a few hundred protesters gathered in Amsterdam today and a similar number marched through the southern city of Breda over the latest Covid-19 measures. Riots also erupted in the central 'Bible Belt' town of Urk and cities in southern Limburg province, while angry fans disrupted two football matches being played behind closed doors because of coronavirus rules, Dutch media . It comes after violent riots last night in which 51 were arrested in Rotterdam after thousands of anti-lockdown protesters gathered on one of the city's main shopping streets. Dutch police fired water canons, 'warning shots' and bullets at protesters to disperse the crowd who had lit fires and set off fireworks. Police confirmed seven injuries, including officers, in the violence but did not if live ammunition or rubber bullets were fired. The Netherlands re-imposed some lockdown measures last weekend for an initial three weeks in an effort to slow a resurgence of coronavirus contagion, but daily infections have remained at their highest levels since the start of the pandemic. The Dutch government has it wants to introduce a law that would allow businesses to restrict the country's coronavirus pass system to only people who are fully vaccinated or have recovered from Covid-19 - that would exclude people who test negative. The violent scenes in Rotterdam mirrored much of the continent's reaction to similar schemes announced by Austria, Germany, the Czech Republic, and Slovakia - with Italy and Greece also reportedly considering moves to restrict the movements of unvaccinated people.

The lockdown, which comes into effect on Monday, constitutes the toughest restrictions introduced in Europe in recent weeks as Covid-19 cases surge continent-wide, fuelled by vaccine resistance. Austrians will not be allowed to leave home except to go to work, shop for essentials and exercise. The restrictions will initially last 20 days with an evaluation after 10 days, Chancellor Alexander Schallenberg . Vaccination against Covid-19 in the Alpine nation will be mandatory from February 1 next year, Schallenberg . So far, the Vatican alone in Europe has imposed a vaccination mandate. The World Health Organization continues to favour policies that 'demonstrate the benefit and safety of vaccines for the greatest possible acceptance of vaccines, rather than imposed mandatory vaccination,' spokeswoman Fadela Chaib told reporters in Geneva. Austria has already imposed movement restrictions on those not vaccinated or recently recovered from the virus, ordering them to stay at home since Monday, becoming the first EU country to do so. But infections have continued to rise. On Friday, a new record of more than 15,800 new cases was recorded in the EU member of nearly nine million people. Reporting by AFP Advertisement Austrians are protesting against a new national lockdown and mandatory vaccinations, which the government yesterday would be rolled out on February 1. Vaccinations in Austria have plateaued at one of the lowest rates in Western Europe - under 66 per cent - and hospitals in heavily hit states have warned that their intensive care units are reaching capacity. Austrian Chancellor Alexander Schallenberg yesterday the country would go in lockdown for 10 days. The shutdown will then reevaluated and could be extended for a further 10 days. Most stores will close, and cultural events will be canceled. People will be able to leave their homes only for certain specific reasons, including buying groceries, going to the doctor or exercising. Average daily deaths have tripled in recent weeks and its infections are among the highest in Europe, with a seven-day incidence of 991 per 100,000 people. 'We have not succeeded in convincing enough people to get vaccinated,' Chancellor Alexander Schallenberg told a news conference. 'It hurts that such measures still have to be taken.' Schallenberg also apologised to all vaccinated people on Friday night saying it was not fair they had to suffer under the renewed lockdown restrictions when they had done everything to help contain the virus. 'I'm sorry to take this drastic step,' he on public broadcaster ORF. Despite the violence a day earlier, around 300 protesters marched through the southern Dutch town of Breda near the Belgian border on Saturday carrying banners with slogans such as 'No Lockdown'. Organisers they opposed Prime Minister Mark Rutte's plans to exclude the unvaccinated from bars and restaurants. A group that had called an Amsterdam protest for Saturday, United We Stand Europe, on Facebook it had cancelled the rally because 'last night, all hell broke loose in Rotterdam'. But several hundred flag-waving protesters still gathered in central Dam Square, watched over by police vans, according to Dutch media and images on social media.

Local news outlet NL Times reported that a journalist was attacked of the street, while local broadcaster Rijnmond the reporter was beaten and his camera was destroyed. Local media also reported gangs of soccer hooligans were involved in the rioting. One eyewitness - a press photographer – told local media they saw shell casings 'everywhere on the floor'. Cops also it was 'unclear how or by whom' two people were shot during the chaos. Video from social media on Dutch broadcaster NOS appeared to show the person being hit in Rotterdam, but there was no explanation on what happened. Officers arrested 51 protesters last night and were expected to detain several more after studying video footage from security cameras. Late on Friday night, police downtown Rotterdam remained restive and there was still a heavy police presence on the streets. Mayor Ahmed Aboutaleb told reporters in the early hours of Saturday morning that 'on a number of occasions the police felt it necessary to draw their weapons to defend themselves' as rioters ran rampage through the port city's central shopping district, setting fires and throwing rocks and fireworks at officers. 'They shot at protesters, people were injured,' Aboutaleb , adding that several officers were injured in the violence. Police spokesperson Patricia Wessels confirmed that police fired shots, though it was not immediately clear what type of rounds were fired.

Professor John Edmund today that opposition to stringent restrictions on the continent have demonstrated the importance of booster jabs, warning, 'it is pretty clear immunity does wane'. 'What you see now in central Europe with these rapid increase in cases, you see the importance of vaccination,' Mr Edmund told Sky. But Mr Edmund the UK was unlikely to be hit by the Christmas chaos because the country 'is in a slightly different position.' He added: 'Frankly here in the UK, we've had high rates of infection for many months now so we're in a slightly different position to Austria and Germany and so on. 'I don't think things will quite happen in the same way here as they have done there. But it is a warning to us. I think it's pretty clear that immunity does wane. 'I'm sure you do still have some protection from the vaccine but it's nowhere near as strong as shortly after you've been vaccinated. It's very clear the booster doses do give a very clear boost to your immune system.' Asked whether the Government should re-introduce control measures, Mr Edmund told Sky: 'The plan B measures, we could've implemented them at any point. It's a government decision whether to take that step. 'They have to look at the potential effectiveness and measure that against the potential cost of some of those things.'

Police also cordoned off several scenes to comb for evidence, with a human finger visible on the ground at one of them, the AFP correspondent . 'Most of the demonstrators are now gone. There only remain a few groups in a few places,' police spokesman Jesse Brobbel told AFP. Dutch justice minister Ferd Grapperhaus in a statement that the 'extreme violence' against police and fire fighters in Rotterdam was 'repulsive'. 'The right to protest is very important in our society but what we saw last night was simply criminal behaviour,' Grapperhaus . Dutch police units from around the country were brought in to 'restore order' to Rotterdam. 'Dozens of arrests have now been made, it is expected that more arrests will follow. Around seven people have been injured, including on the side of the police,' a police statement . At least one police car was set on fire during the protest, a police spokesman confirmed to AFP. The spokesperson could not confirm the number of people injured. Several electric scooters and other items were also torched, with several hundred protesters involved in the riots, images on Dutch media and social media showed. Local authorities issued an emergency order banning people from gathering in the area in a bid to prevent further violence, and the authorities also called on bystanders and people who recorded images of the riots to send the footage to police for further investigation. Police tweeted that rioters started fires and threw fireworks during the rioting and authorities closed the city's main railway station. The several hundred people had gathered to voice opposition to government plans to restrict access to indoor venues to people who have a 'corona pass' showing they have been vaccinated or already recovered from an infection. The pass is also available to people who have not been vaccinated, but have proof of a negative test. 'This is a very serious situation which requires action with the highest priority,' the emergency order by the Rotterdam municipality. 'It is therefore necessary to issue this emergency order so as to maintain public order and to protect the safety of persons.'

It announced that the daily tally jumped to 22,936 on Friday, almost 500 more than the previous record set on Tuesday. The country's infection rate has risen to 929 new cases per 100,000 residents over the past seven days. In a worrying sign, 110 people died on Thursday, the ministry , with the daily death toll surpassing 100 for the first time since April. The government has approved new restrictions to tackle the surge, targeting the unvaccinated in an effort to increase a vaccination rate that is below the European Union average. Starting on Monday, most unvaccinated people will no longer be allowed to show negative coronavirus tests in order to attend public events, go to bars and restaurants, visit hairdressers, museums and similar facilities or use hotels. Only people who are vaccinated or have recovered from Covid-19 will remain eligible. Overall, the nation of 10.7 million has registered almost two million cases with 32,005 deaths. Advertisement Local political party Leefbaar Rotterdam condemned the violence in a tweet. 'The centre of our beautiful city has this evening transformed into a war zone,' it . 'Rotterdam is a city where you can disagree with things that happen but violence is never, never, the solution.' Like much of the rest of Europe, the Netherlands has seen Covid cases soar to record levels in recent days, with more than 21,000 new infections reported on Friday. The latest restrictions were announced on November 12, and sparked clashes between demonstrators and police outside the justice ministry in The Hague. The restrictions came into force the following day, shuttering bars, restaurants, cafes and supermarkets at 8:00 pm daily, while non-essential shops must shut at 6:00 pm. People are limited to having four visitors at home and have been advised to work at home unless absolutely necessary. Public events have been scrapped while football matches must be played behind closed doors. Schools however remain open, and people are allowed to leave their homes without restrictions. The Dutch government has it will review the situation on December 3. It is considering excluding the unvaccinated from bars and restaurants, limiting admittance to people who have been vaccinated or who have recovered from the disease, but there was significant opposition to the plan during a debate in parliament this week. The Netherlands suffered its worst riots in four decades in January after a night-time Covid curfew, the country's first since World War II, came into force. Earlier Friday, the government banned fireworks on Dec. 31 for the second straight year. The ban is intended 'to prevent, as much as possible, extra strain on health care, law enforcement and first responders,' the government Friday. The riots in Rotterdam come after Austria on Friday that it will become the first country in western Europe to reimpose a full Covid-19 lockdown, while neighbouring Germany warned it may follow suit, sending shivers through financial markets worried about the economic fallout. Restrictions have also been placed on the unvaccinated in Germany – where they have been banned from restaurants – as well as in the Czech Republic and Slovakia.

'The situation is very, very serious and difficult,' Markus Soeder, premier of the southern state of Bavaria, as he also announced a shutdown of clubs, bars and night service at restaurants. The eastern state of Saxony unveiled similar measures and went even further by closing all sporting and cultural venues, banning tourism, public consumption of alcohol and barring the unvaccinated from non-essential shops and hairdressers. Saxony premier Michael Kretschmer - whose state has Germany's lowest vaccination rate at just under 60 percent of the population - admitted that many of the restrictions would affect the vaccinated as well. But he tough action was needed to keep hospitals from being overwhelmed and called for 'solidarity' from all citizens. 'We need more 'we' and less 'I' in this pandemic,' he told reporters. Bavaria and Saxony are among the hardest hit regions in the ferocious fourth Covid wave sweeping Germany. Reporting by AFP Advertisement Following the announcement, Freedom Party leader Herbert Kickl posted a picture on Facebook with the inscription: 'As of today Austria is a dictatorship.' The party is planning a protest on Saturday, but Kickl cannot attend because he has tested positive for Covid-19 and must self-isolate for 14 days. Europe has again become the epicentre of the pandemic, accounting for half of global cases and deaths, the WHO . A fourth wave of infections has plunged Germany, Europe's largest economy, into a national emergency, Health Minister Jens Spahn , warning that vaccinations alone will not cut case numbers. Both decisions infuriated many in a country where scepticism about state mandates affecting individual freedoms runs high, encouraged by the far-right Freedom Party, the third biggest in parliament. Asked if Germany could rule out an Austrian-style full lockdown, Spahn : 'We are now in a situation - even if this produces a news alert - where we can't rule anything out. 'We are in a national emergency,' he told a news conference. Looming lockdowns weighed on a range of financial market sectors on Friday, pushing stocks and oil down and boosting the dollar. 'We expect targeted measures (against COVID-19) across some countries mainly according to the health situation, but other factors, such as domestic political situations, will be relevant,' Oxford Economics analysts in a note. 'And while it might take a while before a political consensus can be reached in other countries, it is clear that the tide has turned.' As cases rise again, a number of European governments have started to reimpose limits on activity, ranging from Austria's full lockdown to a partial lockdown in the Netherlands and restrictions on the unvaccinated in parts of Germany, the Czech Republic and Slovakia. Niels Van Regenmortel, the intensive care units coordinator at the ZNA Stuivenberg hospital in Antwerp, there was an increasing risk hospitals in Belgium will have to resort to triage as ICUs fill up amid soaring COVID-19 numbers, calling on the government to restrict night life.

It reveals that Sweden is in the bottom half of countries for vaccine uptake, but ahead of nations including the UK and Germany Europe has become the epicentre of the pandemic once again, with the World Health Organisation warning that the Continent was the only region in the world where deaths had increased - with Covid-related fatalities spiking by five per cent just this week What Covid restrictions are in place in Sweden? The country- which dodged a lockdown unlike most other nations - also has next to no Covid restrictions in place. It dropped its final measures recommending people to work from home where possible on September 29. And advice for people to wear face masks on public transport was abandoned on July. Unlike in other countries the coverings were never compulsory. On November 11 Swedish health authorities went even further telling double-vaccinated people they no longer needed to swab themselves for the virus. But this move has now been reversed after critics it left the country in a dangerous position just before winter. Some travel restrictions are still in place for people coming to the country from non-EU nations and Britain. All arrivals are required to show a certificate they have been double-vaccinated. When this is not possible they are asked to show a negative Covid test result from to come to the country from non-EU countries. All arrivals are also required to prove they up to 48 hours before they travelled. Sweden will impose further restrictions from December 1 requiring everyone attending events of more than 100 people to show proof they are double-vaccinated. Officials have warned more Covid restrictions may be needed this winter. Advertisement Whether or not countries opt to lock down again depends on a wide range of factors, including vaccination rates, mask mandates and the extent to which booster shots are being made available. Germany has further measures will be decided based on when hospitalisation rates hit certain thresholds, while Friday saw its first states - Saxony and Bavaria - cancel all their Christmas markets. The Bavarian state capital of Munich on Tuesday had become the first major German city to cancel its Christmas market for the second year in a row. Saxony's cancellations means the famed Dresden Christmas market is also scrapped. Germany hosts some 2,500 Christmas markets each year, cherished by visitors who come to savour mulled wine and roasted chestnuts, and shop for seasonal trinkets among clusters of wooden chalets. In pre-pandemic times, they drew about 160 million domestic and international visitors annually who brought in revenues of three to five billion euros ($3.4 billion to $5.6 billion), according to the BSM stallkeepers' industry association. In France, President Emmanuel Macron has made it clear he thinks high levels of vaccinations should be enough to avoid future lockdowns. Britain, with higher numbers of infections than most countries in Europe, is rolling out third shots - or boosters - to offset waning protection from the first two and help keep the economy open. While the new measures across Europe are not seen hitting the economy as much as the all-out lockdowns of last year, analysts they could weigh on the recovery in the last quarter, especially if they hurt the retail and hospitality sectors over Christmas. A full lockdown in Germany would be more serious, however. 'With Germany ... imposing new restrictions, any thoughts that the vaccines would offer a way to a more normal Christmas period appear to have gone up in smoke for now, in Europe at least,' Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK. 'Although there is a nagging fear this could ripple out across the region.' The pressure on intensive care units in Germany has not yet reached its peak, Spahn , urging people to reduce contacts to help break the wave. 'How Christmas will turn out, I dare not . I can only it's up to us,' he added.

A couple hug and laugh as they have lunch in a restaurant in Stockholm, Sweden EU issues advice on using Covid-19 pill for adults The European Union's drug regulator has issued advice on using Merck's COVID-19 pill for adults and began a review of a rival tablet from Pfizer to help member states decide on quick adoption ahead of any formal EU-wide approval. In two separate statements on Friday, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) detailed efforts to advance use of the experimental but promising options, as infections and COVID-related deaths are rapidly rising in the region and forcing renewed lockdowns. Merck's COVID-19 tablet, Lagevrio, developed with Ridgeback Biotherapeutics, should be given early and within five days of first symptoms to treat adults who do not need oxygen support and are at risk of their disease worsening. It advised against treatment during pregnancy and for women who plan to or could get pregnant, while adding that breastfeeding must also be stopped around the time of using the pill, which is to be taken twice a day for five days. Drugs in the same class as Merck's Lagevrio have been linked to birth defects in animal studies. The drugmaker, known as MSD outside the United States and Canada, has animal testing shows its pill is safe, but the data have not been made public. EMA it was studying available data on the Pfizer pill Paxlovid, days after the drugmaker sought U.S. approval, adding that a more comprehensive rolling review was expected to start ahead of any approval. It did not specify when that review would be. The EMA last month began a rolling review of the Merck pill and expects to conclude that evaluation by the end of the year. Advertisement Chancellor Angela Merkel on Thursday Germany will limit large parts of public life in areas where hospitals are becoming dangerously full of COVID-19 patients to those who have either been vaccinated or have recovered from the illness. 'It's clear from our experience in England and from what's happening across Europe that while vaccines do a lot of the heavy lifting ... other interventions are required to prevent case numbers rising,' Lawrence Young, virologist and professor of molecular oncology at the University of Warwick. 'Less mask wearing, more mixing indoors due to colder weather and waning immunity are also contributing to the high case levels across Europe.' Sweden, meanwhile, has the lowest Covid infection rate in western Europe — after double-vaccinated nationals were told they don't have to test for the virus even if they get symptoms. The Scandinavian nation — which was subject to international scrutiny last year when it refused to lockdown — is currently recording 85.4 cases per million people, according to Oxford University research site Our World in Data. By comparison, the rate is nearly 1,400 per million in Europe's current Covid capital Austria, which today announced it is going back into a full lockdown from Monday. Sweden's infection rate is far lower than other Western European countries like the Netherlands (1,048.7), Britain (581), Germany (536), and France (201). And for the first time in the pandemic, Sweden is recording fewer cases per population size than its Scandinavian neighbours Denmark (655), Norway (351) and Finland (150). But critics Sweden has been left 'in the dark' over the true extent of its coronavirus wave because the double-vaccinated, equivalent to almost seven in ten people, are not being routinely swabbed. Last week, Sweden broke ranks with its European neighbours once again and told Swedes they did not have to get tested if they were fully jabbed, even if they had symptoms. Covid swabbing rates plunged 35 per cent last week, compared to a month earlier. But this week the policy was reversed in response to rising cases on the continent. A fresh wave of Delta is rolling across the continent and putting pressure on hospitals once again, which has forced most in the EU to bring back some form of curbs. Latest figures show Sweden is only carrying out 1.26 tests per 1,000 people, which is also the lowest number in western Europe. The threat of fresh lockdowns comes as optimism grows about experimental drugs developed by Pfizer and Merck that cut the chance of hospitalisation and severe illness, more weapons in the world's fight against the virus. On Friday, the EU drug regulator it was reviewing data on Pfizer's COVID-19 pill to help member states decide on quick adoption ahead of any formal EU-wide approval. Slovakia has also seen a surge in infections, with 9,171 reported on Friday, its biggest daily tally since the pandemic began. The country of 5.5 million earlier in the week tightened restrictions on people who have not had COVID-19 shots. With a seven-day incidence of 11,500 new cases per million inhabitants, the country has the worst reported epidemic situation in the world, according to Our World in Data statistics.""]"

Alexei\'s wife was among nearly 3,500 people to have been detained by Russian police officers during protests in as many as 100 cities. After being arrested by officers Yulia, 44, posted a selfie onto her Instagram page with the caption: \'Apologies for the poor quality. Very bad light in the police van.\' According to reports from Russian media outlets, Yulia has now been released from police custody in Moscow. It comes after supporters of Putin critic Alexei Navalny continued to clash with police deep into the night as world leaders condemned officers\' \'brutal tactics\' which left crowds of activists bloodied and injured. The wife of Alexei Navalny, Yulia Navalnaya, 44, (pictured) was detained at an anti-government demonstration in Moscow while major anti-Kremlin demonstrations broke out across Russia on Saturday in support of the jailed Putin-critic. She uploaded a picture to Instagram from inside the police van she was placed in following her arrest. Russian media outlets report that she has now been released by police Riot police officers detain a participant in an unauthorized rally in support of Russian opposition activist Alexei Navalny by the Moscow Circus Russian policemen detain men during an unauthorized protest rally against the jailing of opposition leader Alexei Navalny Hundreds of thousands of anti-government protesters took part in demonstrations across 70 cities on Saturday in a show of defiance against the jailing of Navalny, who was poisoned with a nerve agent he was slipped to him by state security agents in August. Demonstrators were dragged off by riot officers to police buses and detention trucks, while some activists were beaten with police batons. Authorities eventually pushed protesters out of Moscow\'s Pushkin Square, but thousands then regrouped along a wide boulevard about half a mile away, many of them throwing snowballs at the police before dispersing. The violent scenes from police drew condemnation from both the United States and the European Union, whose foreign policy chief he deplored the \'widespread arrests\' and the \'disproportionate use of force\'. Similarly, the United States called on Russian authorities to release protesters and journalists detained, and condemned what it called \'harsh tactics\' used against them. Throughout the day and into the early hours of Sunday morning, people were seen holding signs that read \'Russia will be free\' and chanting \'Putin is a thief.\' Some then marched towards the Kremlin, while others blocked Tverskaya Street, the capital\'s main thoroughfare. Reuters reporters estimated at least 40,000 people had gathered in central Moscow for one of the biggest unauthorised rallies for years, but authorities claimed a mere 4,000 people had shown up. The foreign ministry questioned Reuters\' crowd estimate, using sarcasm to suggest it was too high. \'Why not just immediately 4 million?,\' it quipped on its official Telegram messenger channel.

AFP journalists saw several protesters left badly injured after clashing with police in Moscow, which saw its largest gathering of anti-government protesters in two years Protesters clash with riot police during a rally in support of jailed opposition leader Alexei Navalny in downtown Moscow on January 23. The protests in Moscow were estimated to be the largest demonstrations since 2019 when Navalny supporters rallied to demand free local elections \'The United States strongly condemns the use of harsh tactics against protesters and journalists this weekend in cities throughout Russia,\' State Department spokesman Ned Price in a statement. The European Union\'s foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, in a post on Twitter that he deplored the authorities \'disproportionate use of force\', while Britain\'s foreign minister, Dominic Raab, condemned the \'use of violence against peaceful protesters and journalists\'. Navalny being taken into custody and the arrests of his supporters were \'troubling indications of further restrictions on civil society and fundamental freedoms,\' he added. \'We call on Russian authorities to release all those detained for exercising their universal rights and for the immediate and unconditional release of Aleksey Navalny,\' Price , using an alternative spelling. \'We urge Russia to fully cooperate with the international community\'s investigation into the poisoning of Aleksey Navalny and credibly explain the use of a chemical weapon on its soil.\' Protesters in the county\'s east defied bitter cold and a ban by authorities by also staging rallies to demand the release of Putin\'s nemesis, ahead of the larger cities in the west. Protests against Russia\'s President Vladimir Putin took place in temperatures as low as minus 60F (51C) as police forcibly detained supporters of Kremlin foe Navalny, who was arrested upon his return to Russia from Germany on January 17. Putin\'s most vocal domestic critic called for mass rallies after he was arrested upon his return to Moscow on Sunday. He did so knowing he would likely be arrested after surviving a near-fatal poisoning with a Novichok nerve agent in August and after months of treatment in Germany. He was arrested at Sheremetyevo Airport and jailed. There was no immediate comment from the Kremlin, which had previously called the protests illegal and the work of \'provocateurs\'. State prosecutors they would look into alleged violence against police officers by protesters. Demonstrations in support of Navalny were also held in the Baltic states of Lithuania and Estonia on Saturday, as well as in Spain\'s Barcelona, with the protesters in Estonia being joined by environmental activist Yevgenia Chirikova, who fled from Russia in 2015 fearing a crackdown on the opposition. In Berlin, Hamburg and Munich, nearly 1,000 people also demonstrated against Navalny\'s arrest. Small demonstrations were also held in Bulgaria and some 200-300 people protested in Paris. Navalny, who accuses Putin of the plot to poison him last August, was locked up until mid-February as he waits to hear whether a suspended prison term will be converted into three-and-a-half years of jail time. Demonstrators shouted \'Shame, shame\' in Pacific capital Vladivostok as heavily armed baton-wielding OMON special forces officers and national guards threw a protester in a police vehicle. The authorities told crowds that their action was unsanctioned and they faced detention unless they dispersed, with video footage from Vladivostok showing riot police chasing a group of protesters down the street. Demonstrators gathered at Moscow\'s central Pushkin Square and nearby streets despite a heavy police presence and detentions.

Asked if he was afraid - after the authorities warned children could be hurt - he : \'I run fast.\' Asked if he was supporting the anti-Putin demonstrators, he : \'I just came here to watch.\' People attend a rally in support of jailed Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny in Saint Petersburg, Russia January 23 OMOH officers push people during a rally in support of jailed Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny in Moscow, January 23 Pictured: A general view of a rally in support of jailed Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny in Moscow, Russia January 23 Hundreds of people were pictured at the demonstration in Moscow, Some 369 had been detained in by 2pm in the city In the Russian capital, which usually mobilises the largest rallies, protesters planned to meet on the central Pushkin Square at 2:00 pm (1100 GMT) and march towards the Kremlin But more than an hour before the planned rally police began detaining people, AFP journalists reported. Pictured: Police detain blogger Ilya Varlamov during the rally on Saturday One state TV news broadcast \'most of the participants are young people, some of whom do not look 18 years old. \'The detainees were escorted to paddy wagons. \'Before that, the police warned activists several times that in the context of the coronavirus pandemic, mass gatherings of people are prohibited.\' In Ufa, a video showed protesters throwing snowballs and scooping up snow to throw at police seeking to break their rally. Another shocking video reportedly showed protesters beaten by OMON riot police in Orenburg as rallies widened to cities all across Russia\'s 11 time zones. At some rallies, protesters shouted \'Aqua disco\', and carried toilet brushes sprayed with gold paint mimicking the gold interior or Putin\'s alleged Black Sea palace. Another video showed shocking protesters in Krasnoyarsk being dragged on the ground by police in minus 15C. In Vladivostok, it was reported that 26 children had been detained. But Vladimir Putin\'s children\'s ombudsman angrily blamed adult protesters for using children as a \'human shield\'. She : \'Now I know everything about human baseness. Vladivostok - children are standing in a human chain. And adults behind their backs are throwing road cones at OMON [riot police] and hiding again. Who are these people? Are they people?\' Protesters mobile data was being disrupted around protest sites to stop communications between anti-Putin protesters. Pictured: Protesters run away from law enforcement officers during a rally in support of jailed Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny in Vladivostok, Russia January 23. Around 250 people have been reportedly arrested during the protests The Russian authorities told crowds that their action was unsanctioned and they faced detention unless they dispersed.

In far-eastern city Khabarovsk, crowds chanted \'Putin\'s Dogs\' as law enforcement detained protesters. At one point crowds fought back with police seeking to release those being held. In Kamchatka, nine time zones east of Moscow, protesters carried placards reading \'Corruption is the cancer of our country\' and \'I\'m choosing Freedom\'. While crowds were not huge, protests went ahead in all main cities in the Russian Far East including former GULAG staging post Magadan on the Sea of Okhotsk in a temperature of minus 30C. In Yakutsk - the world\'s coldest city - crowds gathered in minus 51C to support jailed Navalny, who was earlier allegedly poisoned with nerve agent Novichok by an FSB secret service hit squad. Navalny accuses Putin of a plot to poison him last August.

In Siberia city Ulan-Ude extra Saturday classes were put on to prevent school students joining the unsanctioned protests which the authorities were illegal. In Komsomolsk-on-Amur a squad of OMON detained a dozen people, as the crowd chanted: \'Freedom to political prisoners!\' Navalny\'s supporters his arrest when he returned from Germany on Sunday was politically motivated. Reports suggest he may be hit with new legal action that could see him remain behind bars for more than a decade.

Protests against Vladimir Putin took place in temperatures as low as minus 60F (51C) Navalny - a 44-year-old lawyer who has dedicated himself to toppling strongman Putin - styles himself an anti-corruption campaigner who despite being behind bars in recent days accused the Russian president of using state cash to enrich himself, his family and his cronies. Among the claims is that Putin has built himself a £1 billion palace at Gelendzhik on the Black Sea. Putin denies any wrongdoing. The Kremlin has denied being \'afraid\' of Navalny and his pro-democracy campaigners but are concerned to act tough to prevent mass support growing for a Ukrainian-style revolution. However, it is unclear that Navalny has the mass support he would need to overthrow ex-KGB spy Putin who has been president or prime minister for 21 years. Bigger protests were expected later in Moscow and St Petersburg, led by Navalny\'s wife Yulia who announced she planned to take to the streets in support of her jailed husband.

In Moscow, mayor Sergei Sobyanin had warned the rallies were \'unacceptable\' during a pandemic, and police would take action to ensure public order. In Berlin, Hamburg and Munich, nearly 1,000 people demonstrated against Navalny\'s arrest. Small demonstrations were also held in Bulgaria and some 200-300 people protested in Paris. Police in Siberia\'s Yakutsk, one of the coldest cities in the world, where the temperature was -52 Celsius (-62 F) on Saturday, grabbed a protester by his arms and legs and dragged him into a van, video footage showed. In Moscow, some journalists covering the protests were detained, drawing a rebuke from the U.S. Embassy. ""Russian authorities arresting peaceful protesters, journalists,"" spokesperson Rebecca Ross on Twitter. ""Appears to be a concerted campaign to suppress free speech, peaceful assembly."" Navalny called for his supporters to take to the streets after a hastily organised court ordered him jailed for 30 days on Monday. The makeshift court - set up in a police station on the outskirts of Moscow where Navalny was being held - ruled he be held in custody until February 15 when he will appear in court on corruption charges. The 44-year-old anti-corruption campaigner previously was handed a suspended sentence for the charges in 2014. Russia now accuses him of breaching the terms of that sentence by not checking in with police as often as he should have done. In a video released by his team shortly after the ruling, Navalny urged his supporters to take to the streets and protest as Western governments called for his immediate release. Russia\'s most prominent opposition leader Alexei Navalny has called on Monday for his supporters to take to the streets after a hastily organised court ordered him jailed for 30 days Police officers stand outside a police station where detained Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny is being held, in Khimki outside Moscow, Russia January 18 But Kremlin press secretary Dmitry Peskov Tuesday that Russia\'s leaders did not fear mass protests - adding that they had heard the Western outrage but \'cannot and are not going to take these statements into account\'. He also rejected the suggestion that Putin was afraid of Navalny, following claims by the Kremlin critic\'s supporters that putting him in prison could turn him into a Nelson Mandela-like symbol of resistance. The Investigative Committee, which probes major crimes, Friday it launched a criminal probe into the calls for unauthorised protests. It comes as Navalny released a statement from prison on Tuesday, saying he had no regrets about returning to Russia despite his arrest.

I refuse to put up with the lawlessness of the authorities [in] my country. I refuse to stay silent, listening to the shameless lies of Putin and his friends, mired in corruption.\' On the eve of the rallies, Navalny, who is being held in Moscow\'s high-security Matrosskaya Tishina jail, thanked his supporters. \'I know perfectly well that there are lots of good people outside of my prison\'s walls and help will come,\' he on Friday. Navalny\'s wife Yulia she would join the protest in Moscow. \'For myself, for him, for our children, for the values and the ideals that we share,\' she on Instagram. Ahead of the demonstrations several key Navalny aides were taken into police custody for violating protest laws and handed short jail sentences to keep them away from the rallies. Navalny and his wife sit on the tarmac in Berlin before flying back to Russia on Sunday, five months after he was airlifted to Germany in a coma following his Novichok poisoning Alexei Navalny with his wife Yulia at Moscow\'s Sheremetyevo airport on Sunday where he was arrested after returning to Russia from Germany Navalny\'s team this week released an investigation into an opulent Black Sea property allegedly owned by Putin. The \'Putin\'s palace\' report alleges the Russian leader owns a 17,691 square metre mansion that sits on a property 39 times the size of Monaco and features a casino along with a theatre and a hookah lounge complete with a pole-dancing stage. The two-hour video report had been viewed more than 65 million times since Tuesday, becoming the Kremlin critic\'s most-watched YouTube investigation. The Kremlin has denied the property belongs to Putin. Many Russians took to social media - including video sharing app TikTok hugely popular with teens - to voice support and urge a large turnout on Saturday. A hashtag demanding freedom for Navalny was trending on TikTok as Russians flooded the Chinese app with thousands of videos. Russia\'s media watchdog warned online platforms against encouraging minors to participate in the rallies or risk hefty fines. The watchdog on Friday that media platforms, including TikTok, YouTube and Instagram, removed content at its request. Russia\'s most popular social network VKontakte blocked groups created to coordinate the protests in different cities. But a number of public figures - including those who usually steer clear of politics - have spoken out in Navalny\'s support. Navalny (centre in a green jacket) was photographed being escorted from the police station in Khimski on Monday evening The opposition leader appeared to shout to hit supporters gathered outside the station as he was being escorted from the building Navalny, 44, flashed a peace sign to photographers and supporters as he was escorted from the police station where he has been detained into a van How Alexei Navalny has been punished for defying Putin 2011: Navalny is arrested and jailed for 15 days for \'defying an official\' after leading protests in Moscow 2012: Jailed for 15 days after leading an anti-Putin protest in the wake of presidential elections. His apartment is subsequently raided, and some of his private emails posted online 2013: Put on trial for embezzlement, amid claims he tried to steal wood from a state-owned company. He is convicted and sentenced to five years, but allowed out on bail. The conviction is subsequently overturned 2014: Placed under house arrest, again charged with embezzlement alongside brother Oleg. Again, the conviction is overturned 2017: He is re-convicted in the first corruption case, and ordered to repay millions of rubles of compensation in the second While leaving his office, a pro-Kremlin activist throws green disinfectant dye in his face, partially blinding him 2018: Arrested twice for leading protests against presidential elections he was barred from running in. Jailed for a total of 50 days in jail 2019: Arrested and jailed for a total of 40 days for leading protests during Moscow Duma elections. While in jail he was rushed to hospital, suffering from what medics called an allergic reaction. Others believe he was poisoned 2020: Navalny is rushed unconscious to hospital and placed on a ventilator after falling ill on a flight. His allies he was poisoned August 22, 2020: Navalny is transferred from a hospital in Siberia to another hospital in Berlin September 2020: German scientists revealed tests confirmed he was poisoned by Novichok nerve agent December 2020: Bellingcat investigation alleges Moscow\'s FSB agency began tracking Nevalny after he announced plans to run against Putin before launching an assassination attempt in August using Novichok December 2020: Navalny claimed he had tricked an FSB agent into admitting on a phone call Russian assassins tried to kill him using poisoned underpants and then tried to cover it up. The FSB dismissed the recording as fake January 2021: Navalny is arrested at Moscow\'s Sheremetyevo airport after Russia\'s prison service alleged he had violated parole terms from a suspended sentence on a 2014 embezzlement conviction Advertisement Navalny rose to prominence a decade ago and has become the central figure of Russia\'s opposition movement, leading large-scale street protests against corruption and electoral fraud. His arrest drew widespread Western condemnation, with the United States, the European Union, France and Canada all calling for his release. Navalny\'s anti-corruption foundation that the 44-year-old was \'illegally detained\' and that \'lawyers are not allowed to see him\'. The opposition leader had joked with journalists on the plane from Berlin on Sunday. \'All the criminal cases against me are fabricated,\' he added. After the plane landed, Navalny kissed his wife Yulia before four masked police officers escorted him away at passport control, before he had formally entered Russia. He reappeared on Monday morning at a Moscow police station where a court hearing to extend his detention was already underway. \'It is impossible what is happening over here,\' Navalny in a video from the improvised courtroom. \'It is lawlessness of the highest degree. \'One minute ago I was taken out of my cell to meet the lawyer, I came here, and here a hearing of the [court] is happening.\' Navalny\'s lawyers the immediate court hearing was an unexpected turn of events, saying they were only notified about it minutes earlier. According to a police notice distributed published Navalny\'s lawyer Vadim Kobzev, the legal process began at 12.30pm local time on Monday. The Moscow prison service had warned that it would arrest Navalny once he returned. It accused Navalny of flouting the terms of a three-and-a-half-year suspended prison sentence in a 2014 embezzlement case. Navalny\'s supporters had gathered at Moscow\'s Vnukovo airport despite bitterly cold weather and more than 4,500 new coronavirus cases a day in the Russian capital. But they were denied a glimpse of Navalny after the flight path was switched at the last minute and the plane landed at Sheremetyevo instead. OVD Info, which monitors detentions at political protests in Russia, at least 55 people had been detained at the airport. Prominent Moscow activist Lyubov Sobol was among those arrested, saying later that they had been released and were facing administrative charges. The latest episode in the Navalny saga has led to calls for more sanctions against Russia, amid a wave of condemnation from Western countries. Donald Trump\'s outgoing secretary of state Mike Pompeo on Twitter: \'Deeply troubled by Russia\'s decision to arrest Alexei Navalny. \'Confident political leaders do not fear competing voices, nor see the need to commit violence against or wrongfully detain, political opponents,\' he . France also called for Navalny\'s release and voiced its \'strong concern\' over his arrest in Russia. Putin\'s spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, responded to a question about the arrest by saying \'Was he arrested in Germany? I\'m not up to date,\' according to Russian media. The Kremlin typically belittles Navalny by referring to him merely as the \'Berlin patient\' and calling him a blogger rather than a politician. Navalny fell into a coma while aboard a domestic flight from Siberia to Moscow on August 20. He was airlifted from a hospital in Siberia to Berlin two days later, where a military lab found evidence of Novichok. Russian authorities insisted that the doctors who treated Navalny in Siberia before he was airlifted to Germany found no traces of poison and have challenged German officials to provide proof of his poisoning. Navalny with his wife and children after waking from his coma at the Berlin hospital where doctors his previous good health contributed to his recovery The Kremlin has rejected calls to open a full investigation into the poisoning, and denied Navalny\'s claims that the FSB security agency was behind the plot. Last month Navalny claimed he had duped an FSB agent into confessing details of the plot in a recorded phone call which the agency dismissed as fake. The alleged plotter, Konstantin Kudryavtsev, was one of a team of alleged chemical weapons experts named last month as suspects in Navalny\'s poisoning. The recording purported to reveal that Navalny\'s underpants had been sprinkled with the nerve agent while he was staying at a hotel in Siberia.

There is a \'surge\' in communication among members of the alleged FSB unit August 20: Navalny boards the flight in Tomsk and becomes critically ill on board, forcing an emergency landing August 22: The unconscious Navalny is airlifted to Berlin. A German military lab later finds evidence of Novichok Advertisement Navalny was initially treated at a hospital in Omsk before Russian authorities agreed to hand him over to a German air ambulance crew on August 22. In an article in The Lancet, doctors at Berlin\'s Charite hospital described how Navalny had to be ventilated and given drugs during his airlift to Germany. Medics described how he had become confused and sweaty before vomiting and collapsing on the domestic flight in Siberia, leaving him unconscious and drooling when the plane made an emergency landing. By the time he arrived at the Berlin hospital, more than two days after falling ill, his heart had slowed well below an adult\'s usual range of 60 to 100 beats per minute and his brain was starting to show signs of reduced responsiveness. When he arrived in intensive care, he was showing \'decreased brainstem reflexes\' and suffering from hypothermia with a body temperature of just 33.5C (92.5F). Navalny was treated with atropine for 10 days and given other antibiotics by the hospital doctors, who he started to breathe spontaneously within two weeks. As his condition improved, he was brought out of a coma, and doctors determined that difficulties understanding speech and speaking he had initially showed after waking up disappeared after three weeks. On the 24th day after falling ill, he was taken off mechanical ventilation, and two days later he was moved from intensive care into a normal hospital ward. Navalny has been a thorn in the Kremlin\'s side for more than a decade, exposing what he is high-level corruption and mobilising protests. He has been repeatedly detained for organising public meetings, sued over corruption investigations and was barred from running against Putin in the 2018 presidential election. The 44-year-old has also served several stints in jail in recent years for organising anti-Kremlin protests. The European Court of Human Rights has ruled that Russia\'s arrests and detention of Navalny in 2012 and 2014 were politically motivated.', ""The move sparked panic as flights out of Russia sold out as civilians try to escape a potentially being called up Police wearing blacked-out helmets are dragging anti-mobilisation protestors off the streets of Russia tonight, as thousands come out to demonstrate against being sent to the front lines in Ukraine. More than 1,000 people have been arrested tonight in 37 cities across Russia, including Moscow and St Petersburg, as they voiced their anger at President Vladimir Putin's order to mobilise 300,000 reservists. There have been angry clashes between activists and security forces, with protestors being forcefully taken to the ground and removed from the streets as the government cracks down on vocal dissent. Demonstrators tonight chanted anti-war slogans, with some calling for Putin himself to go to the trenches in Ukraine, while other's have angrily proclaimed they're not willing to die for him. It is reported a total of 828 arrests have been made so far, with this number likely to rise throughout the night as the government cracks down on vocal dissent. In the capital Moscow 303 people have been arrested, while the former imperial capital of St Petersburg saw 279 taken into custody, and 40 more have been arrested in Yekaterinburg, a city east of the Ural Mountains. As protests spread, many men of fighting age opted to try and leave the country, driven by fears the border might soon be closed, with tickets for one-way flights out of Moscow being snapped up by worried Russians. The decision to mobilise the country is the first of its type in the country since the Second World War, and has come as Russian forces sustain humiliating losses to advancing Ukrainian troops in the east of the country. The first protests against the partial mobilisation took place in Siberia, with demonstrators risking being jailed under draconian laws forbidding criticism of the armed forces. Videos circulating on social media show people marching through the streets of Moscow chanting 'no to war', and mass arrests by armed police wearing riot gear and all black clothing. One protester was hauled into detention in Novosibirsk after shouting at police and FSB officers at a rally: 'I am not going to die for Putin, or for you!'

A protester's voice is heard saying 'What are you doing?' as he is detained, while another asks: 'Are you animals?' One more voice : 'They are [protesting] so as not to be sent there [to the war in Ukraine].' Anger has also erupted on social media and a new word was even invented to describe the hell Putin has unleashed - 'Mogilisation', from the Russian word 'Могила' [Mogila] - or grave, the morbid fate awaiting thousands drafted into the army. While some took to the streets, others tried to flee the regime and ticket prices duly skyrocketed, with a family of three having to fork out £44,000 to fly to Johannesburg, while the cheapest flights to Dubai were costing more than £8,000 - about ten times the average monthly wage, for a one-way economy fare.

Kirill Martynov, editor-in-chief of the opposition news site, claimed Putin has declared war 'on his people and his country' with the controversial mobilisation order. He wrote: 'The panic of the Russian Federation and the indifference of Ukraine are not accidental. Putin's announcement of an allegedly partial, limited mobilisation is much more dangerous for the Russians themselves. 'Until recently, the main problem of Russian citizens was the inability to buy currency or the withdrawal of Western brands from the country, and now the national sport of men will be salvation from the front, saving life, health and, if possible, freedom. 'Vladimir Putin really wants to enter into some kind of history and drags along the people who still hoped to live. 'Having started an unreasonable, aggressive war against a neighbouring sovereign country, annexing its territories, destroying his own soldiers for the sake of illusions of geopolitics and amateur lectures on history, blackmailing the world with a nuclear bomb, and finally starting mobilization, Vladimir Putin declared war on his people and country.' Advertisement According to Russian investigative news outlet RBK, all plane tickets to countries where Russians would not need a visa, including Turkey, Armenia and Georgia, have now sold out, while flagship airline Aeroflot is not displaying any available flights. Some alleged people already had been turned back from Russia's land border with Georgia and that the website of the state Russian railway company collapsed because too many people were checking for ways out of the country. Putin's apocalyptic nuclear warnings have prompted even China to demand a ceasefire 'through dialogue and consultation', while Turkey's Recep Tayyip Erdogan Putin should return all occupied land, including Crimea, to its 'rightful owners'. Meanwhile the US will retaliate with 'a devastating strike' if Putin uses nuclear weapons, the United States Army's former European commander has warned. Russian Railways and Aeroflot they hadn't 'yet' been ordered to ban men aged 18 to 65 from boarding. A group based in Serbia, Russians, Belarussians, Ukrainians and Serbs Together Against War, tweeted that there were no available flights to Belgrade from Russia until mid-October. Flights to Turkey, Georgia or Armenia also sold out, according to the Belgrade-based group. Alexei Navalny, Russia's most prominent opposition leader, Putin was sending more Russians to their deaths for a failing war. 'It is clear that the criminal war is getting worse, deepening, and Putin is trying to involve as many people as possible in this,' Navalny in a video message from jail recorded and published by his lawyers. 'He wants to smear hundreds of thousands of people in this blood,' Navalny . The tyrant's announcement, made in an early-morning television address, raised fears that some men of fighting age would not be allowed to leave Russia. Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu the call-up would be limited to those with experience as professional soldiers, and that students and those who had only served as conscripts would not be called up. Nevertheless, the move has raised fears of mass conscription in the worrying escalation of the war. A former top Russian state TV presenter on propagandist Channel One, Zhanna Agalokova, 56, today publicly denounced Putin - and sent back honours she had been awarded. In a letter she told the warmonger: 'Mr President, your leadership is plunging the country into the abyss. I consider awards given by you as unacceptable.' Meanwhile a mixture of fear, anger, and dissent was spreading across Russian social media networks. 'I am super worried for my young male friends and my boyfriend,' one woman, 28, from a city thousands of miles east of the Kremlin where the Russian president issued his fateful TV call-up. Lilianna D demanded: 'I recommend mobilising the entire Duma [parliament] and their families first of all. And let people see how loyal they are.' Andrey Shipilov, a Cyprus-based Russian journalist, posted: 'A friend from Russia has just messaged…an entire institute's [graduates], all reserve officers, have already been called up this morning'. Putin vowed that he will use 'all available means' to defend what he sees as Russian territory, adding: 'I'm not bluffing' (pictured, a Russian nuclear test) Russia has announced plans for referendums to take place in four regions of Ukraine it either fully or partially occupied - Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson The benchmark rouble-based MOEX index hit its lowest point since February 24 Screaming former Putin advisor warns despot is ready to NUKE Britain A former Russian MP and Putin advisor declared that British cities will be targeted by Putin's nukes in a bare-faced tirade this morning on the Today programme. Sergei Markov had barely exchanged pleasantries with BBC Radio 4 host Justin Webb when he launched into a series of threats about nuclear war. 'It's not a good morning for everybody. In Russia there's partial mobilisation and for your British listeners Vladimir Putin told you that he would be ready to use nuclear weapons against Western countries... including against Great Britain. 'Your cities will be targeted.' Markov, who was elected to Russia's State Duma in 2007 representing Putin's United Russia party, is now a professor of international relations at a Moscow university and has a history of spouting Putin's rhetoric in Western media. 'If Great Britain will continue to be aggressor against Russia... if Prime Minister of Great Britain Liz Truss still has a plan to destroy Russia, people in London should understand the threat [of nuclear weapons],' he . Markov's unhinged comments today came moments after the Russian president announced partial mobilisation to reinforce his faltering war in Ukraine and delivered his most pronounced nuclear threat yet towards the West. Markov from the get-go set about decrying Western involvement in the Russia-Ukraine conflict and accused the West of using Ukrainian soldiers as 'slaves' to deplete the Russian army. 'It was absolutely clear that Russia has no war against Ukraine...there's no reason to use tactical nuclear weapons against Ukrainians,' he . 'But Ukraine is occupied by Western countries... it's Western countries fighting against Russian army, using Ukrainian soldiers as their slaves. This was the main idea of Vladimir Putin.' Bemused host Justin Webb allowed Markov to reach a conclusion before calmly asking whether the ex-Putin aide and the Russian people believed there could be a winner in a nuclear war. 'Everybody in the world is now thinking about nuclear war... which could be the result of crazy behaviour of US president Joe Biden and prime ministers of Great Britain Boris Johnson and [Liz] Truss,' Markov retorted. Advertisement Putin's gambit comes after Ukraine routed a large part of the Russian army last week, leaving him backed into a corner of his own making and facing the possible collapse of his so-called 'special military operation'. But rather than back down, the Russian leader has instead chosen to double down and hold the free world to ransom - putting Russia and its huge nuclear arsenal on direct collision course with Ukraine and its allies, who have already vowed not to accept the results of 'sham' referendums or to stop liberating occupied territory. Retired Lieutenant General Ben Hodges today any response by America 'may not be nuclear' but warned that if Putin were to use nukes in Ukraine that the US could look to 'destroy the Black Sea Fleet or destroy Russian bases in Crimea'. Gen Hodges, who commanded the US Army in Europe between 2014 and 2018, stressed the 'possibility' of Putin ordering a nuclear strike on Ukraine was 'very unlikely'. But he the use of any strategic weapons of mass destruction would be met with a swift and severe reaction from President Joe Biden. 'He [Putin] knows the US will have to respond if Russia uses a nuclear weapon,' Gen Hodges told MailOnline. 'The US response may not be nuclear...but could very well be a devastating strike that could, for example, destroy the Black Sea Fleet or destroy Russian bases in Crimea. 'So, I think President Putin and those around him will be reluctant to draw the US into the conflict directly.' John Kirby, spokesman for the White House's National Security Council, Putin's nuclear threat was 'irresponsible' and it would be taken 'seriously' by the US. The White House official reiterated previous comments by President Joe Biden when asked what the US response would be to Russia reaching for its nuclear arsenal, which analysts speculate could mean detonating a demonstration blast over the Black Sea, using battlefield nuclear warheads to limit the radiation, or ultimately using a larger weapon. 'There'll be severe consequences. Not only will he be that much more of pariah on the world stage, but there'll have to be severe consequences that the international community will have.' NATO's secretary general Jens Stoltenberg added that Putin was issuing 'dangerous and reckless rhetoric', but it demonstrated 'that the war is not going according to his plans' and it was clear that the Russian president had made 'a big miscalculation'. Speaking ahead of Putin's speech last night, President Zelensky dismissed 'noise' from Russia and it will not alter Ukraine's resolve. Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba likewise vowed: 'The Russians can do whatever they want. It will not change anything. Ukraine has every right to liberate its territories and will keep liberating them whatever Russia has to .' Mykhailo Podolyak, an adviser to Ukrainian President Volodrymyr Zelensky, spoke out this morning after Putin's announcement - calling it 'predictable' and saying it show the war is not going to plan. President Joe Biden is expected to give a speech to the UN later today when he will rally Ukraine's allies to stay the course. Retired Lieutenant General Ben Hodges, who commanded the US Army in Europe between 2014 and 2018, the chance of Putin nuking Ukraine was 'very unlikely' The US could launch 'devastating strikes' on Russian military targets in Crimea and the Black Sea, pictured, if Putin nukes Ukraine, a former US Army commander has warned today 'This will hurt Russia more than it hurts Ukraine': Why Putin's 300,000 reservists WON'T win the war – and could end up backfiring Vladimir Putin today ordered the first mobilisation of Russia’s military reserves since the Second World War in an attempt to turn around his failing war in Ukraine. Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu claimed that 300,000 men – twice the size of the original invading force – will be pressed into service, including veterans and those with ‘special skills’ the army needs. But, according to Dr Stepan Stepanenko, the lead Russia Research Fellow at the Henry Jackson Society, the new recruits are unlikely to turn the tide in Putin’s favour. He told MailOnline: ‘They will be cannon fodder, it’s as simple as that. 300,000 is a lot, even if you give them sticks it will make a difference. ‘But it is unlikely the Russian infrastructure, particularly the corrupt military infrastructure, can deploy them all at the same time. They will probably be deployed bit by bit, they will get killed off bit by bit, and it won't make much difference to the overall war. ‘If anything, it will swing the war in Ukraine’s favour rather than Russia’s. Already there are protests in Russia by those who don’t want to go. ‘They don’t have the modern tanks or modern planes they did a few months ago. There was talk in Putin's speech about setting the entire country on a war footing, but it has not yet happened and I'm not sure the Russian people will be able to do it. The corruption in Russia is so high that any kind of turnaround is highly improbable.’ Viktorija Starych-Samuolienė, the co-founder of the Council on Geostrategy, agreed. She told MailOnline: ‘It is important to remember that [Defence Minister Sergei] Shoigu has given wildly inaccurate statements in the past, and his figure of 300,000 conscripts may prove to be another one of these. ‘Regardless of the true number of newly called-up soldiers, it will take time for them to be equipped, trained and transported to the front lines. ‘One of the biggest challenges the Russian military currently faces is in logistics: soldiers not having armour plating or the right type of shovels, using decades-old equipment and vehicles, no secure communications methods etc… This problem will not go away and will almost certainly become worse with the addition of (for argument's sake) 300,000 new soldiers.’ Advertisement Podolyak mobilisation will prove extremely unpopular within Russia, and accused Putin of trying to shift the blame for starting an 'unprovoked war' and crashing the economy on to the West. It is thought the mobilisation will press around 300,000 people into the Russian army - around twice the size of the force that Putin invaded with. But it is unclear when exactly these men will become available, and the move will do nothing to solve Russia's chronic lack of equipment, supplies and other logistical issues that have spelled disaster for its invasion so-far. Putin had resisted declaring any kind of mobilistion until now, apparently fearing backlash from Russians who may have been supporting his 'special military operation' only because they had nothing to lose. But the Russian leader dramatically changed tack under pressure from allies, propagandists and hardliners after another humiliating military defeat near Kharkiv last week which had sparked calls for him to resign. He was at pains to stress that the mobilisation is only partial, and will not affect ordinary citizens, conscripts or students. Those called up to service - starting today - will be those with experience of service and combat, he insisted. Speaking after Putin, Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu gave a rare update on Russian casualty figures, preposterously claiming that only 6,000 Kremlin troops have been killed in the war so far. Ukrainian losses, he , were ten times that: 61,000 dead in addition to 49,000 wounded. In a speech delayed for 13 hours overnight - triggering wishful rumours of a coup inside the Kremlin - Putin delivered his twisted interpretation of the war to date. He attempted to rewrite history to paint the West and NATO as the aggressor - saying they had pushed Ukraine into a war with Russia, despite ordering an invasion of the country himself just seven months ago. Ukraine began the war back in 2014, he - referring to the date of Russia's last invasion - when the 'Nazi' regime in Kyiv had turned the military on its own civilians in an attempted genocide following what he called a 'coup' to oust the country's last pro-Kremlin leader. In Putin's retelling, the West 'refused a peaceful solution' and instead began rearming Ukraine for an attack on the Donbas - leaving him with no choice but to launch a pre-emptive war to protect people. He falsely claimed that peace negotiations with Ukraine were deliberately undermined by Kyiv's bloody-minded Western allies, who then began training and equipping its armed forces with the goal of destroying Russia. Attacks on schools and hospitals are not the work of the Russian army, as reams of evidence suggests, but are in fact the work of Ukrainian Nazis and nationalists, he . Facing these threats, Putin he has no choice but to accept the requests of his puppet leaders in occupied Ukraine to hold referendums on joining Russia, and no choice but to call up his military reserves. He added: 'In its aggressive anti-Russian policies, the West has crossed all lines... There are plans in Washington and Brussels to move the military action on to Russian territory. A dead soldier lies on the ground in Ukraine as Putin dramatically escalates his war A refrigerated train filled with the bodies of Putin's fallen troops returns from Ukraine earlier in the war 'Doctors called after Putin suffered coughing fit amid chaotic scenes behind TV address' Doctors were called to Putin's aid amid behind the scenes chaos as he prepared to issue his doomsday nuclear threats, Kremlin rumours have claimed. The Russian tyrant allegedly suffered coughing fits and chest pains in the lead-up to his TV address, which was delayed for 13 hours. The General SVR Telegram channel, believed to be run by a former Kremlin insider which had predicted the mobilisation move, Putin's speech had to be re-recorded multiple times because of his ill health. They also claimed that three key figures threatened to resign over the president's dramatic escalation, including the respected Elvira Nabiullina, the head of the Russian central bank who has kept the economy afloat amid Western sanctions. The Telegram channel : 'Several attempts to start recording an appeal were frustrated due to coughing. 'After the fourth unsuccessful attempt to record an appeal, doctors were called to the president, to whom Putin also complained of chest pains.' Advertisement 'They are not just talking about Russia being destroyed on the battlefield, they are talking about political, cultural, and all other types of sovereignty with complete pillage. Now they're talking about nuclear blackmail. 'Those who make such statements will be reminded that our country also has various weapons of destruction and with regard to certain components they are even more modern than the NATO ones. 'If there is any threat to the territorial integrity of our country and to protect our people we will certainly use all means available to us. I'm not bluffing. 'Russia citizens can be certain that the territorial integrity of our motherland, our independence and security will be assured. I shall stress - by all means available to us 'And those trying to blackmail us with nuclear weapons should know that the tables can turn on them 'In our historic tradition our people had it in their destiny to stop those how are trying to subjugate our motherland and it will happen now.' The allegations are an almost exact inversion of everything Russia has been accused of doing, and is a common trope of Kremlin propaganda. Referendums will begin this week into next week, according to Russia occupation authorities, with the results expected to be announced shortly after. Police and officials will go door-to-door to ensure people cast their votes, they , leaving few doubts about which way they will be voting. Ballot boxes will also be set up inside Russia itself, ostensibly to allow those who have already fled those regions a chance to cast a vote - but in all likelihood will be stuffed with fake ballots. Early 'polling' released by Russian state media last night showed - unsurprisingly - that more than 80 per cent of people in the four regions want to join Russia. In Donetsk and Luhansk - the focus of Putin's war effort - the reported figure was over 90 per cent.

'The situation on at the front clearly indicates the initiative is with Ukraine,' Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in a video address released early on Wednesday. Ukraine's position did not change because of 'some noise' from Russia, Zelensky added in a reference to the referendums. Advertisement Russia is now almost seven months into what was intended to be a days-long war in Ukraine, and the situation for its troops is becoming increasingly desperate. Having been forced to retreat from Kyiv in the early months of fighting after its advance stalled, the Kremlin's war machine instead focused its efforts on 'liberating' the eastern Donbas region. Months of grinding warfare saw Russia capture the whole of the Luhansk region, but only around half of neighbouring Donetsk - which make up the Donbas. As Russia's advances slowed and then stopped, Ukraine went on the counter-attack - launching an offensive on the southern city of Kherson. Russia moved forces from other areas of the country to help defend the city, at which point Ukraine launched a second counter-attack east out of Kharkiv - in the north. That move caught the Kremlin's commanders completely off guard, triggering a rout that handed 3,000 square miles of territory that Russia had spent months capturing back to Ukraine in just a few days. And Kyiv has continued to press the attack, regaining a foothold in the Luhansk region and threatening to push further across the province. Faced with war on two fronts and not enough men to hold the territory he has already captured, Putin was left with few options but to begin conscripting men. However, experts and analysts it will do little to turn the tide of the war in his favour. It will take at least weeks, possibly months, to gather, equip, train and transport hundreds of thousands more men to the frontlines - time that Russia does not have. By the time reinforcements arrive winter will be setting in when combat operations will be considerably harder, compounding the issues that Russia's military already faces. And mobilising more men will do nothing to solve the chronic lack of equipment and supplies among Russia's ranks, or fix the logistical issues which have hampered its attacks. Some drew comparisons with the disastrous Winter War that the Soviet Union fought against Finland, which ended with hundreds of thousands of Red Army troops dead or wounded to around 25,000 Finnish. Western leaders had pre-empted Putin's remarks at the UN last night, saying they would not recognise the results of any 'sham' referendums in Ukraine. 'The Russians can do whatever they want. It will not change anything,' Ukraine's Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba on Tuesday as world leaders were arriving for the United Nations General Assembly meeting. He later doubled down on the issue, tweeting: 'Sham 'referendums' will not change anything. Neither will any hybrid 'mobilization.' 'Russia has been and remains an aggressor illegally occupying parts of Ukrainian land. Ukraine has every right to liberate its territories and will keep liberating them whatever Russia has to .' French President Emmanuel Macron that if the referendum plan 'wasn't so tragic it would be funny.' He described Russia's invasion as 'a return to a new age of imperialism and colonies' and warned that inaction risked 'tearing down the global order without which peace is not possible.' 'It's not a matter of choosing one side between East and West, or North or South. It's a matter of responsibility' to the UN Charter, he .

Chancellor Olaf Scholz the world was 'facing a new fragmentation' after years of hope following the end of the Cold War and his own nation's reunification.

President Joe Biden will make an address to the UN today in which he will argue that Russia's 'naked aggression' in Ukraine is an affront to the heart of what the international body stands for. White House officials the focus of his time at the general assembly will be rallying Ukraine allies to stay the course against Russia, and remain united in the face of Putin's threats. 'He'll offer a firm rebuke of Russia's unjust war in Ukraine and make a call to the world to continue to stand against the naked aggression that we've seen these past several months,' White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan in previewing the president's address. 'He will underscore the importance of strengthening the United Nations and reaffirm core tenets of its charter at a time when a permanent member of the Security Council has struck at the very heart of the charter by challenging the principle of territorial integrity and sovereignty.' In his nightly address Zelenskyy there were lots of questions surrounding the announcements but stressed that they would not change Ukraine's commitment to retake areas occupied by Russian forces. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky addressed world leaders at the UN last night, thanking Western leaders for condemning Russia's plans to break away parts of his country Emmanuel Macron was among leaders to address the UN on Ukraine last night, accusing Putin of trying to 'return to an age of imperialism and colonies' 'The situation on the front line clearly indicates that the initiative belongs to Ukraine,' he . 'Our positions do not change because of the noise or any announcements somewhere. And we enjoy the full support of our partners in this. 'I thank all friends and partners of Ukraine for today's mass principled firm condemnation of Russia's attempts to stage new sham referenda,' Zelensky . In another signal that Russia is digging in for a protracted and ramped-up conflict, the Kremlin-controlled lower of house of parliament voted Tuesday to toughen laws against desertion, surrender and looting by Russian troops. Lawmakers also voted to introduce possible 10-year prison terms for soldiers refusing to fight. If approved, as expected, by the upper house and then signed by Putin, the legislation would strengthen commanders' hands against failing morale reported among soldiers. In the Russian-occupied city of Enerhodar, shelling continued around Europe's largest nuclear power plant. Ukrainian energy operator Energoatom Russian shelling again damaged infrastructure at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant and briefly forced workers to start two diesel generators for emergency power to reactor cooling pumps. Such pumps are essential for avoiding a meltdown at a nuclear facility even though all six of the plant's reactors have been shut down. Energoatom the generators were later switched off as main power weas restored. The Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant has been a focus for concern for months because of fears that shelling could lead to a radiation leak. Russia and Ukraine blame each other for the shelling."", ""The move sparked panic as flights out of Russia sold out as civilians try to escape a potentially being called up Police wearing blacked-out helmets are dragging anti-mobilisation protestors off the streets of Russia tonight, as thousands come out to demonstrate against being sent to the front lines in Ukraine. More than 1,000 people have been arrested tonight in 37 cities across Russia, including Moscow and St Petersburg, as they voiced their anger at President Vladimir Putin's order to mobilise 300,000 reservists. There have been angry clashes between activists and security forces, with protestors being forcefully taken to the ground and removed from the streets as the government cracks down on vocal dissent. Demonstrators tonight chanted anti-war slogans, with some calling for Putin himself to go to the trenches in Ukraine, while other's have angrily proclaimed they're not willing to die for him. It is reported a total of 828 arrests have been made so far, with this number likely to rise throughout the night as the government cracks down on vocal dissent. In the capital Moscow 303 people have been arrested, while the former imperial capital of St Petersburg saw 279 taken into custody, and 40 more have been arrested in Yekaterinburg, a city east of the Ural Mountains. As protests spread, many men of fighting age opted to try and leave the country, driven by fears the border might soon be closed, with tickets for one-way flights out of Moscow being snapped up by worried Russians. The decision to mobilise the country is the first of its type in the country since the Second World War, and has come as Russian forces sustain humiliating losses to advancing Ukrainian troops in the east of the country. The first protests against the partial mobilisation took place in Siberia, with demonstrators risking being jailed under draconian laws forbidding criticism of the armed forces. Videos circulating on social media show people marching through the streets of Moscow chanting 'no to war', and mass arrests by armed police wearing riot gear and all black clothing.

One more voice : 'They are [protesting] so as not to be sent there [to the war in Ukraine].' Anger has also erupted on social media and a new word was even invented to describe the hell Putin has unleashed - 'Mogilisation', from the Russian word 'Могила' [Mogila] - or grave, the morbid fate awaiting thousands drafted into the army. While some took to the streets, others tried to flee the regime and ticket prices duly skyrocketed, with a family of three having to fork out £44,000 to fly to Johannesburg, while the cheapest flights to Dubai were costing more than £8,000 - about ten times the average monthly wage, for a one-way economy fare.

Kirill Martynov, editor-in-chief of the opposition news site, claimed Putin has declared war 'on his people and his country' with the controversial mobilisation order. He wrote: 'The panic of the Russian Federation and the indifference of Ukraine are not accidental. Putin's announcement of an allegedly partial, limited mobilisation is much more dangerous for the Russians themselves. 'Until recently, the main problem of Russian citizens was the inability to buy currency or the withdrawal of Western brands from the country, and now the national sport of men will be salvation from the front, saving life, health and, if possible, freedom. 'Vladimir Putin really wants to enter into some kind of history and drags along the people who still hoped to live. 'Having started an unreasonable, aggressive war against a neighbouring sovereign country, annexing its territories, destroying his own soldiers for the sake of illusions of geopolitics and amateur lectures on history, blackmailing the world with a nuclear bomb, and finally starting mobilization, Vladimir Putin declared war on his people and country.' Advertisement According to Russian investigative news outlet RBK, all plane tickets to countries where Russians would not need a visa, including Turkey, Armenia and Georgia, have now sold out, while flagship airline Aeroflot is not displaying any available flights. Some alleged people already had been turned back from Russia's land border with Georgia and that the website of the state Russian railway company collapsed because too many people were checking for ways out of the country. Putin's apocalyptic nuclear warnings have prompted even China to demand a ceasefire 'through dialogue and consultation', while Turkey's Recep Tayyip Erdogan Putin should return all occupied land, including Crimea, to its 'rightful owners'. Meanwhile the US will retaliate with 'a devastating strike' if Putin uses nuclear weapons, the United States Army's former European commander has warned. Russian Railways and Aeroflot they hadn't 'yet' been ordered to ban men aged 18 to 65 from boarding. A group based in Serbia, Russians, Belarussians, Ukrainians and Serbs Together Against War, tweeted that there were no available flights to Belgrade from Russia until mid-October. Flights to Turkey, Georgia or Armenia also sold out, according to the Belgrade-based group. Alexei Navalny, Russia's most prominent opposition leader, Putin was sending more Russians to their deaths for a failing war. 'It is clear that the criminal war is getting worse, deepening, and Putin is trying to involve as many people as possible in this,' Navalny in a video message from jail recorded and published by his lawyers. 'He wants to smear hundreds of thousands of people in this blood,' Navalny . The tyrant's announcement, made in an early-morning television address, raised fears that some men of fighting age would not be allowed to leave Russia. Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu the call-up would be limited to those with experience as professional soldiers, and that students and those who had only served as conscripts would not be called up. Nevertheless, the move has raised fears of mass conscription in the worrying escalation of the war. A former top Russian state TV presenter on propagandist Channel One, Zhanna Agalokova, 56, today publicly denounced Putin - and sent back honours she had been awarded. In a letter she told the warmonger: 'Mr President, your leadership is plunging the country into the abyss. I consider awards given by you as unacceptable.' Meanwhile a mixture of fear, anger, and dissent was spreading across Russian social media networks. 'I am super worried for my young male friends and my boyfriend,' one woman, 28, from a city thousands of miles east of the Kremlin where the Russian president issued his fateful TV call-up. Lilianna D demanded: 'I recommend mobilising the entire Duma [parliament] and their families first of all. And let people see how loyal they are.' Andrey Shipilov, a Cyprus-based Russian journalist, posted: 'A friend from Russia has just messaged…an entire institute's [graduates], all reserve officers, have already been called up this morning'. Putin vowed that he will use 'all available means' to defend what he sees as Russian territory, adding: 'I'm not bluffing' (pictured, a Russian nuclear test) Russia has announced plans for referendums to take place in four regions of Ukraine it either fully or partially occupied - Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson The benchmark rouble-based MOEX index hit its lowest point since February 24 Screaming former Putin advisor warns despot is ready to NUKE Britain A former Russian MP and Putin advisor declared that British cities will be targeted by Putin's nukes in a bare-faced tirade this morning on the Today programme. Sergei Markov had barely exchanged pleasantries with BBC Radio 4 host Justin Webb when he launched into a series of threats about nuclear war. 'It's not a good morning for everybody. In Russia there's partial mobilisation and for your British listeners Vladimir Putin told you that he would be ready to use nuclear weapons against Western countries... including against Great Britain. 'Your cities will be targeted.' Markov, who was elected to Russia's State Duma in 2007 representing Putin's United Russia party, is now a professor of international relations at a Moscow university and has a history of spouting Putin's rhetoric in Western media. 'If Great Britain will continue to be aggressor against Russia... if Prime Minister of Great Britain Liz Truss still has a plan to destroy Russia, people in London should understand the threat [of nuclear weapons],' he . Markov's unhinged comments today came moments after the Russian president announced partial mobilisation to reinforce his faltering war in Ukraine and delivered his most pronounced nuclear threat yet towards the West. Markov from the get-go set about decrying Western involvement in the Russia-Ukraine conflict and accused the West of using Ukrainian soldiers as 'slaves' to deplete the Russian army. 'It was absolutely clear that Russia has no war against Ukraine...there's no reason to use tactical nuclear weapons against Ukrainians,' he . 'But Ukraine is occupied by Western countries... it's Western countries fighting against Russian army, using Ukrainian soldiers as their slaves. This was the main idea of Vladimir Putin.' Bemused host Justin Webb allowed Markov to reach a conclusion before calmly asking whether the ex-Putin aide and the Russian people believed there could be a winner in a nuclear war. 'Everybody in the world is now thinking about nuclear war... which could be the result of crazy behaviour of US president Joe Biden and prime ministers of Great Britain Boris Johnson and [Liz] Truss,' Markov retorted. Advertisement Putin's gambit comes after Ukraine routed a large part of the Russian army last week, leaving him backed into a corner of his own making and facing the possible collapse of his so-called 'special military operation'. But rather than back down, the Russian leader has instead chosen to double down and hold the free world to ransom - putting Russia and its huge nuclear arsenal on direct collision course with Ukraine and its allies, who have already vowed not to accept the results of 'sham' referendums or to stop liberating occupied territory. Retired Lieutenant General Ben Hodges today any response by America 'may not be nuclear' but warned that if Putin were to use nukes in Ukraine that the US could look to 'destroy the Black Sea Fleet or destroy Russian bases in Crimea'. Gen Hodges, who commanded the US Army in Europe between 2014 and 2018, stressed the 'possibility' of Putin ordering a nuclear strike on Ukraine was 'very unlikely'. But he the use of any strategic weapons of mass destruction would be met with a swift and severe reaction from President Joe Biden. 'He [Putin] knows the US will have to respond if Russia uses a nuclear weapon,' Gen Hodges told MailOnline. 'The US response may not be nuclear...but could very well be a devastating strike that could, for example, destroy the Black Sea Fleet or destroy Russian bases in Crimea. 'So, I think President Putin and those around him will be reluctant to draw the US into the conflict directly.' John Kirby, spokesman for the White House's National Security Council, Putin's nuclear threat was 'irresponsible' and it would be taken 'seriously' by the US. The White House official reiterated previous comments by President Joe Biden when asked what the US response would be to Russia reaching for its nuclear arsenal, which analysts speculate could mean detonating a demonstration blast over the Black Sea, using battlefield nuclear warheads to limit the radiation, or ultimately using a larger weapon. 'There'll be severe consequences. Not only will he be that much more of pariah on the world stage, but there'll have to be severe consequences that the international community will have.' NATO's secretary general Jens Stoltenberg added that Putin was issuing 'dangerous and reckless rhetoric', but it demonstrated 'that the war is not going according to his plans' and it was clear that the Russian president had made 'a big miscalculation'. Speaking ahead of Putin's speech last night, President Zelensky dismissed 'noise' from Russia and it will not alter Ukraine's resolve. Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba likewise vowed: 'The Russians can do whatever they want. It will not change anything. Ukraine has every right to liberate its territories and will keep liberating them whatever Russia has to .' Mykhailo Podolyak, an adviser to Ukrainian President Volodrymyr Zelensky, spoke out this morning after Putin's announcement - calling it 'predictable' and saying it show the war is not going to plan. President Joe Biden is expected to give a speech to the UN later today when he will rally Ukraine's allies to stay the course. Retired Lieutenant General Ben Hodges, who commanded the US Army in Europe between 2014 and 2018, the chance of Putin nuking Ukraine was 'very unlikely' The US could launch 'devastating strikes' on Russian military targets in Crimea and the Black Sea, pictured, if Putin nukes Ukraine, a former US Army commander has warned today 'This will hurt Russia more than it hurts Ukraine': Why Putin's 300,000 reservists WON'T win the war – and could end up backfiring Vladimir Putin today ordered the first mobilisation of Russia’s military reserves since the Second World War in an attempt to turn around his failing war in Ukraine. Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu claimed that 300,000 men – twice the size of the original invading force – will be pressed into service, including veterans and those with ‘special skills’ the army needs. But, according to Dr Stepan Stepanenko, the lead Russia Research Fellow at the Henry Jackson Society, the new recruits are unlikely to turn the tide in Putin’s favour. He told MailOnline: ‘They will be cannon fodder, it’s as simple as that. 300,000 is a lot, even if you give them sticks it will make a difference. ‘But it is unlikely the Russian infrastructure, particularly the corrupt military infrastructure, can deploy them all at the same time. They will probably be deployed bit by bit, they will get killed off bit by bit, and it won't make much difference to the overall war. ‘If anything, it will swing the war in Ukraine’s favour rather than Russia’s. Already there are protests in Russia by those who don’t want to go. ‘They don’t have the modern tanks or modern planes they did a few months ago. There was talk in Putin's speech about setting the entire country on a war footing, but it has not yet happened and I'm not sure the Russian people will be able to do it. The corruption in Russia is so high that any kind of turnaround is highly improbable.’ Viktorija Starych-Samuolienė, the co-founder of the Council on Geostrategy, agreed. She told MailOnline: ‘It is important to remember that [Defence Minister Sergei] Shoigu has given wildly inaccurate statements in the past, and his figure of 300,000 conscripts may prove to be another one of these. ‘Regardless of the true number of newly called-up soldiers, it will take time for them to be equipped, trained and transported to the front lines. ‘One of the biggest challenges the Russian military currently faces is in logistics: soldiers not having armour plating or the right type of shovels, using decades-old equipment and vehicles, no secure communications methods etc… This problem will not go away and will almost certainly become worse with the addition of (for argument's sake) 300,000 new soldiers.’ Advertisement Podolyak mobilisation will prove extremely unpopular within Russia, and accused Putin of trying to shift the blame for starting an 'unprovoked war' and crashing the economy on to the West. It is thought the mobilisation will press around 300,000 people into the Russian army - around twice the size of the force that Putin invaded with. But it is unclear when exactly these men will become available, and the move will do nothing to solve Russia's chronic lack of equipment, supplies and other logistical issues that have spelled disaster for its invasion so-far. Putin had resisted declaring any kind of mobilistion until now, apparently fearing backlash from Russians who may have been supporting his 'special military operation' only because they had nothing to lose. But the Russian leader dramatically changed tack under pressure from allies, propagandists and hardliners after another humiliating military defeat near Kharkiv last week which had sparked calls for him to resign. He was at pains to stress that the mobilisation is only partial, and will not affect ordinary citizens, conscripts or students. Those called up to service - starting today - will be those with experience of service and combat, he insisted. Speaking after Putin, Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu gave a rare update on Russian casualty figures, preposterously claiming that only 6,000 Kremlin troops have been killed in the war so far. Ukrainian losses, he , were ten times that: 61,000 dead in addition to 49,000 wounded. In a speech delayed for 13 hours overnight - triggering wishful rumours of a coup inside the Kremlin - Putin delivered his twisted interpretation of the war to date. He attempted to rewrite history to paint the West and NATO as the aggressor - saying they had pushed Ukraine into a war with Russia, despite ordering an invasion of the country himself just seven months ago. Ukraine began the war back in 2014, he - referring to the date of Russia's last invasion - when the 'Nazi' regime in Kyiv had turned the military on its own civilians in an attempted genocide following what he called a 'coup' to oust the country's last pro-Kremlin leader. In Putin's retelling, the West 'refused a peaceful solution' and instead began rearming Ukraine for an attack on the Donbas - leaving him with no choice but to launch a pre-emptive war to protect people. He falsely claimed that peace negotiations with Ukraine were deliberately undermined by Kyiv's bloody-minded Western allies, who then began training and equipping its armed forces with the goal of destroying Russia. Attacks on schools and hospitals are not the work of the Russian army, as reams of evidence suggests, but are in fact the work of Ukrainian Nazis and nationalists, he . Facing these threats, Putin he has no choice but to accept the requests of his puppet leaders in occupied Ukraine to hold referendums on joining Russia, and no choice but to call up his military reserves. He added: 'In its aggressive anti-Russian policies, the West has crossed all lines... There are plans in Washington and Brussels to move the military action on to Russian territory. A dead soldier lies on the ground in Ukraine as Putin dramatically escalates his war A refrigerated train filled with the bodies of Putin's fallen troops returns from Ukraine earlier in the war 'Doctors called after Putin suffered coughing fit amid chaotic scenes behind TV address' Doctors were called to Putin's aid amid behind the scenes chaos as he prepared to issue his doomsday nuclear threats, Kremlin rumours have claimed. The Russian tyrant allegedly suffered coughing fits and chest pains in the lead-up to his TV address, which was delayed for 13 hours. The General SVR Telegram channel, believed to be run by a former Kremlin insider which had predicted the mobilisation move, Putin's speech had to be re-recorded multiple times because of his ill health. They also claimed that three key figures threatened to resign over the president's dramatic escalation, including the respected Elvira Nabiullina, the head of the Russian central bank who has kept the economy afloat amid Western sanctions. The Telegram channel : 'Several attempts to start recording an appeal were frustrated due to coughing. 'After the fourth unsuccessful attempt to record an appeal, doctors were called to the president, to whom Putin also complained of chest pains.' Advertisement 'They are not just talking about Russia being destroyed on the battlefield, they are talking about political, cultural, and all other types of sovereignty with complete pillage. Now they're talking about nuclear blackmail. 'Those who make such statements will be reminded that our country also has various weapons of destruction and with regard to certain components they are even more modern than the NATO ones. 'If there is any threat to the territorial integrity of our country and to protect our people we will certainly use all means available to us. I'm not bluffing. 'Russia citizens can be certain that the territorial integrity of our motherland, our independence and security will be assured. I shall stress - by all means available to us 'And those trying to blackmail us with nuclear weapons should know that the tables can turn on them 'In our historic tradition our people had it in their destiny to stop those how are trying to subjugate our motherland and it will happen now.' The allegations are an almost exact inversion of everything Russia has been accused of doing, and is a common trope of Kremlin propaganda. Referendums will begin this week into next week, according to Russia occupation authorities, with the results expected to be announced shortly after. Police and officials will go door-to-door to ensure people cast their votes, they , leaving few doubts about which way they will be voting. Ballot boxes will also be set up inside Russia itself, ostensibly to allow those who have already fled those regions a chance to cast a vote - but in all likelihood will be stuffed with fake ballots. Early 'polling' released by Russian state media last night showed - unsurprisingly - that more than 80 per cent of people in the four regions want to join Russia. In Donetsk and Luhansk - the focus of Putin's war effort - the reported figure was over 90 per cent.

'This is why we will not accept any peace dictated by Russia and this is why Ukraine must be able to fend off Russia's attack,' Scholz in his first address to the General Assembly.

'The situation on at the front clearly indicates the initiative is with Ukraine,' Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in a video address released early on Wednesday. Ukraine's position did not change because of 'some noise' from Russia, Zelensky added in a reference to the referendums. Advertisement Russia is now almost seven months into what was intended to be a days-long war in Ukraine, and the situation for its troops is becoming increasingly desperate. Having been forced to retreat from Kyiv in the early months of fighting after its advance stalled, the Kremlin's war machine instead focused its efforts on 'liberating' the eastern Donbas region. Months of grinding warfare saw Russia capture the whole of the Luhansk region, but only around half of neighbouring Donetsk - which make up the Donbas. As Russia's advances slowed and then stopped, Ukraine went on the counter-attack - launching an offensive on the southern city of Kherson. Russia moved forces from other areas of the country to help defend the city, at which point Ukraine launched a second counter-attack east out of Kharkiv - in the north. That move caught the Kremlin's commanders completely off guard, triggering a rout that handed 3,000 square miles of territory that Russia had spent months capturing back to Ukraine in just a few days. And Kyiv has continued to press the attack, regaining a foothold in the Luhansk region and threatening to push further across the province. Faced with war on two fronts and not enough men to hold the territory he has already captured, Putin was left with few options but to begin conscripting men. However, experts and analysts it will do little to turn the tide of the war in his favour. It will take at least weeks, possibly months, to gather, equip, train and transport hundreds of thousands more men to the frontlines - time that Russia does not have. By the time reinforcements arrive winter will be setting in when combat operations will be considerably harder, compounding the issues that Russia's military already faces. And mobilising more men will do nothing to solve the chronic lack of equipment and supplies among Russia's ranks, or fix the logistical issues which have hampered its attacks. Some drew comparisons with the disastrous Winter War that the Soviet Union fought against Finland, which ended with hundreds of thousands of Red Army troops dead or wounded to around 25,000 Finnish. Western leaders had pre-empted Putin's remarks at the UN last night, saying they would not recognise the results of any 'sham' referendums in Ukraine. 'The Russians can do whatever they want. It will not change anything,' Ukraine's Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba on Tuesday as world leaders were arriving for the United Nations General Assembly meeting. He later doubled down on the issue, tweeting: 'Sham 'referendums' will not change anything. Neither will any hybrid 'mobilization.' 'Russia has been and remains an aggressor illegally occupying parts of Ukrainian land. Ukraine has every right to liberate its territories and will keep liberating them whatever Russia has to .' French President Emmanuel Macron that if the referendum plan 'wasn't so tragic it would be funny.' He described Russia's invasion as 'a return to a new age of imperialism and colonies' and warned that inaction risked 'tearing down the global order without which peace is not possible.' 'It's not a matter of choosing one side between East and West, or North or South. It's a matter of responsibility' to the UN Charter, he .

President Joe Biden will make an address to the UN today in which he will argue that Russia's 'naked aggression' in Ukraine is an affront to the heart of what the international body stands for. White House officials the focus of his time at the general assembly will be rallying Ukraine allies to stay the course against Russia, and remain united in the face of Putin's threats. 'He'll offer a firm rebuke of Russia's unjust war in Ukraine and make a call to the world to continue to stand against the naked aggression that we've seen these past several months,' White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan in previewing the president's address. 'He will underscore the importance of strengthening the United Nations and reaffirm core tenets of its charter at a time when a permanent member of the Security Council has struck at the very heart of the charter by challenging the principle of territorial integrity and sovereignty.' In his nightly address Zelenskyy there were lots of questions surrounding the announcements but stressed that they would not change Ukraine's commitment to retake areas occupied by Russian forces. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky addressed world leaders at the UN last night, thanking Western leaders for condemning Russia's plans to break away parts of his country Emmanuel Macron was among leaders to address the UN on Ukraine last night, accusing Putin of trying to 'return to an age of imperialism and colonies' 'The situation on the front line clearly indicates that the initiative belongs to Ukraine,' he . 'Our positions do not change because of the noise or any announcements somewhere. And we enjoy the full support of our partners in this. 'I thank all friends and partners of Ukraine for today's mass principled firm condemnation of Russia's attempts to stage new sham referenda,' Zelensky . In another signal that Russia is digging in for a protracted and ramped-up conflict, the Kremlin-controlled lower of house of parliament voted Tuesday to toughen laws against desertion, surrender and looting by Russian troops. Lawmakers also voted to introduce possible 10-year prison terms for soldiers refusing to fight. If approved, as expected, by the upper house and then signed by Putin, the legislation would strengthen commanders' hands against failing morale reported among soldiers. In the Russian-occupied city of Enerhodar, shelling continued around Europe's largest nuclear power plant. Ukrainian energy operator Energoatom Russian shelling again damaged infrastructure at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant and briefly forced workers to start two diesel generators for emergency power to reactor cooling pumps. Such pumps are essential for avoiding a meltdown at a nuclear facility even though all six of the plant's reactors have been shut down. Energoatom the generators were later switched off as main power weas restored. The Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant has been a focus for concern for months because of fears that shelling could lead to a radiation leak. Russia and Ukraine blame each other for the shelling.""]"

The bill gives the Communist Party draconian powers to punish 'secession, subversion, terrorism and foreign interference' and allows its secret police to operate openly in Hong Kong. Chinese president Xi Jinping cast one of the 2,878 votes for the bill - with only one against - in a move which has triggered a fresh wave of protests in the city despite Beijing's promise to 'smash' any resistance. Lawmakers in the city mourned 'the end of Hong Kong' today and the former British colony 'just becomes another Chinese city' under Beijing's authoritarian control. Washington the move would 'fundamentally undermine Hong Kong's high degree of autonomy and freedoms' which were promised when it returned to Chinese rule under a 'one country, two systems' formula in 1997. US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo yesterday Hong Kong no longer qualified for special treatment under US law, potentially dealing a crushing blow to its status as a major financial hub. Japan has also voiced concern while UK ministers are facing calls to take 'immediate action'. Taiwan accused China of 'shattering' the city's freedom, offering Hong Kong residents the chance to escape Beijing's rule by moving to Taiwan under a plan for 'humanitarian assistance'. Meanwhile, riot police were deployed across Hong Kong today after mass protests as lawmakers debated a bill that would criminalise disrespect of China's national anthem. Chinese leader Xi Jinping pushes a button to vote on the new national security law for Hong Kong, which critics will destroy the autonomy of the former British colony today China's Communist Party leaders and delegates sit at the opening of the National People's Congress in Beijing as the country's parliament voted to impose a new security law on Hong Kong The National People's Congress voted 2,878 to 1 in favour of the decision to empower its standing committee to draft the Hong Kong national security legislation, with six abstentions A scuffle broke out at a session of Hong Kong's Legislative Council which was debating a separate measure criminalising any abuse or insults of the Chinese national anthem Pro-democracy supporters are pictured scuffling with riot police during an detention at a rally in Causeway Bay district on Wednesday. The national anthem and national security bills have re-ignited the anti-government unrest which started in June last year in the Asian financial hub The security law was 'only the latest in a series of actions undermining Hong Kong freedoms, Pompeo told Congress. 'No reasonable person can assert today that Hong Kong maintains a high degree of autonomy from China, given facts on the ground,' he . Beijing reacted angrily to Pompeo's move, saying the decision to revoke Hong Kong's special status 'is the most barbaric, the most unreasonable and the most shameless'. In a further response today, the governments of the US, UK, Australia and Canada China's move was 'in direct conflict with its international obligations'. Direct rule from Beijing 'would curtail the Hong Kong people's liberties, and in doing so, dramatically erode Hong Kong's autonomy and the system that made it so prosperous,' a joint statement . 'We are also extremely concerned that this action will exacerbate the existing deep divisions in Hong Kong society; the law does nothing to build mutual understanding and foster reconciliation within Hong Kong. 'Rebuilding trust across Hong Kong society by allowing the people of Hong Kong to enjoy the rights and freedoms they were promised can be the only way back from the tensions and unrest that the territory has seen over the last year.' 'The world’s focus on a global pandemic requires enhanced trust in governments and international cooperation. Beijing’s unprecedented move risks having the opposite effect.' China the law was necessary because Hong Kong has become a 'national security risk' following years of anti-Beijing demonstrations. Chinese authorities and the Beijing-backed government in Hong Kong there is no threat to the city's high degree of autonomy and the new security law would be tightly focused. Premier Li Keqiang lawmakers had 'passed the decision to maintain national security, and it represents the steady and lasting [execution of] one country, two systems, and the safeguard of the long-term prosperity and stability of Hong Kong.' But the move prompted immediate warnings that the law would be used to persecute protesters, and China could bring charges of subversion and terrorism against them.

Critics the act would lead to the widespread use of secret police, arbitrary detentions, surveillance and even control over the internet on the island territory. The new law could see Chinese intelligence agencies set up bases in the city, which was promised in 1997 that its freedoms would remain unchanged for 50 years. Those liberties included a free market economy, an independent judiciary, free speech and a local legislature.

Emily Lau, a former chair of the city's Democratic Party, Beijing could send authorities to Hong Kong to set up their own 'national security office' and impose the mainland's laws. 'One country, two systems is over. It's one country, one system,' she told Sky News today, urging Boris Johnson to speak out 'however busy he is' with the pandemic. The Human Rights Foundation the Chinese Communist Party had 'signed a death sentence' for Hong Kong's autonomy. Hong Kong's unpopular pro-Beijing leader Carrie Lam has the law will not stifle freedoms, claiming it showed 'the country's care towards Hong Kong'. 'It will not affect the legitimate rights and freedoms enjoyed by Hong Kong residents,' she , adding that the new powers were there to 'sanction an extremely small minority of criminals who threaten national security'. 'A stable and safe society will provide a favourable business and investment environment. This will help better Hong Kong’s development down the road,' she . The Chinese National People's Congress passed the Hong Kong bill at its closing ceremony in Beijing this afternoon local time. The law is expected to be enacted before September. The National People's Congress voted 2,878 to 1 in favour of the decision to empower its standing committee to draft the legislation, with six abstentions.

On Thursday, dozens gathered in a shopping mall, chanting 'good kids don't become cops,' and 'reclaim Hong Kong' as the Hong Kong's parliament continued to debate over the bill - the latest spark of anti-government unrest in the semi-autonomous city. Meanwhile three pro-democracy lawmakers were ejected from Hong Kong's legislative chamber this morning, disrupting debate on a bill that would criminalise insulting or abusing the Chinese national anthem. 'We have wanted to use any method to stop this national anthem law getting passed by this legislature, which is basically controlled by the Chinese Communist Party, because the law is just another way of putting pressure on Hong Kong people,' one of the ejected lawmakers, Eddie Chu, outside the chamber. Protests raged in Hong Kong for months last year over plans for a separate law which would have allowed Hong Kong residents to be extradited to the mainland. The protests were spearheaded by young people, who will see China's 50-year promise of freedom expire in their lifetimes. Nearly 23 of those 50 years have already passed. The angry protests have subsided during the coronavirus pandemic, which first emerged in China, but the new bill has seen the first major demonstrations for months.

The United States and China clashed over Hong Kong at the United Nations on Wednesday after Beijing opposed a request by Washington for the Security Council to meet over the national security legislation. The US mission it was 'a matter of urgent global concern that implicates international peace and security'. China the legislation was an internal matter. The loss of Hong Kong's trade privileges could mean Hong Kong identity card holders might lose their ability to visit the United States without applying for a visa in advance. Washington also could revoke its promise to exchange Hong Kong dollars for U.S dollars, potentially disrupting the city's financial system, Deutsche Bank economist Michael Spencer in a report. The New York Times reported that Trump administration officials were preparing to cancel the visas of thousands of Chinese students who are linked to the People's Liberation Army. Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden would also sanction China if he is elected in November, his campaign , accusing Trump of having 'enabled' Beijing's curbs on Hong Kong freedom. If Washington opts for hardline measures it would risk 'all of the financial connectivity that China has to the free market', according to Robert Spalding, a US-China expert at the Hudson Institute. The two countries are locked in a number of other disputes, a row over Chinese telecommunications firm Huawei and a fierce dispute over Beijing's handling of the virus outbreak. Meanwhile, Taiwan promised to settle any Hong Kong people who flee for political reasons, offering help from employment to counselling.

Mr Johnson the draconian new security law that China has imposed on Hong Kong was 'plainly an unacceptable breach' of the freedoms that the city was guaranteed after Britain handed it back in 1997. Linking the crisis to the Huawei deal, the PM told the Evening Standard that 'I don't want to see our critical national infrastructure at risk of being in any way controlled by potentially hostile state vendors... so we have to think very carefully about how to proceed now.' Q&A on Hong Kong's British Nationals Overseas (BNOs) What is a British National (overseas)? Hong Kongers could register for this special status before the 1997 handover. They get a UK passport but no automatic right to live and work in the UK. You cannot apply to become a BNO. How many of them are there? As of February, there were 349,881 BNO passport holders. The Government estimates that there are around 2.9million BNOs currently in Hong Kong. What is Britain offering them? A path to citizenship. BNOs will get five years 'limited leave to remain'. They can then apply for 'settled status'. After 12 months with settled status, they can apply for citizenship. Their close family will also be eligible. Advertisement Mr Johnson has been under massive pressure to change course on Huawei after agreeing in January to give the Chinese tech giant a 'limited' role in the 5G network, despite fears that Beijing would use it for espionage. Since then, the coronavirus pandemic and the chaos in Hong Kong have thrown Britain's relations with China into crisis - with Beijing now threatening to punish the UK for offering refuge to Hong Kongers. Hundreds were arrested in a crackdown on Hong Kong protesters yesterday just hours after the new law came into force, bringing in long prison sentences for dissent and trials run by the mainland Communist Party. Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab yesterday unveiled plans to offer residency and a possible route to citizenship to British Nationals (Overseas), a group of nearly three million people with links to Hong Kong. But Beijing regards them as Chinese nationals and its embassy in London warned today that 'we firmly oppose this and reserve the right to take corresponding measures'. Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian told a press conference today that 'the UK should bear any consequences caused by this... Hong Kong matters are China's domestic affairs, and no countries have any right to intervene.' Mr Raab admitted last night that there would be little the UK could do if China tried to stop Hong Kongers from leaving. China did not how it might retaliate, but it has recently hit Australia with a series of tariffs, export bans and warnings against travelling and studying in the country after it led global calls for an inquiry into coronavirus. Australia today it is considering a similar citizenship offer, while Taiwan has opened an office to help Hong Kongers take refuge there.

Mr Cheng, a British overseas national, announced Wednesday night that his immigration application had been approved last Friday by the British government. The pro-democracy activist, 29, today that 'hundreds of thousands of people' from Hong Kong might follow his footsteps and choose to come to the UK. The former consulate worker was detained in China for over two weeks last August after Beijing accused the former consulate worker of inciting unrest amid mass anti-government demonstrations in Hong Kong.

'It's the only option. I don't think I can go back home now. I will be persecuted,' she told The Times. In a separate interview with BBC Radio 5 Live, Ms Wong she would not be able to go home again after talking to foreign media. Thousands of Hong Kong citizens have already expressed their desire to move to Britain on social media platforms. A Facebook group named the 'Official Group for BNO Equality Movement' has seen nearly 3,000 new members in the past month. Numerous Hong Kong websites have published articles explaining the process of applying for the new BNO rights, including one titled 'Things you must know before immigration'. Advertisement The PM is under pressure on Huawei from all sides, with Tory backbenchers repeatedly bringing up the issue in yesterday's Commons debate on Hong Kong. Tom Tugendhat, the chairman of the Foreign Affairs Select Committee, also raised concerns about China's influence on the UK university sector - citing claims that 'Chinese students have already been influenced to silence debate and change outcomes here in the UK'. Labour has also called for Britain to 'develop home grown alternatives' to Chinese technology and make 'a proper assessment of the national security implications' before green-lighting the Huawei deal. Mr Raab told MPs that Huawei's role was currently 'under review' by the National Cyber Security Centre, with ministers no longer sticking by the January deal to let Huawei into 35 per cent of the network and none of its 'core' elements. Unveiling the offer to Hong Kongers, Mr Raab the 'bespoke' new arrangement to be implemented in the coming months would grant BNOs five years' limited leave to remain in the UK with the ability to live and work. They would then be eligible to apply for settled status and would be able to apply for citizenship after 12 months with that status. At the moment, BNOs can travel on a British passport and receive UK diplomatic help but do not have the automatic right to live or work in Britain. The status had to be acquired before 1997 and can no longer be applied for, although 'dependents' of BNO holders will be eligible under the scheme. As of February, there were nearly 350,000 BNO passport holders, while the Government estimates there are around 2.9million BNOs living in Hong Kong. 'This is a special, bespoke set of arrangements developed for the unique circumstances we face and in the light of our historic commitment to the people of Hong Kong,' Mr Raab . However, the Foreign Secretary later 'only a proportion' would be likely to take up the new status. He also that if Beijing tried to stop people with British National (Overseas) status from leaving Hong Kong, there would be little that could be done by the UK. Mr Raab told ITV's Peston programme: 'There is diplomatic leverage, there are other ways that we can persuade China not to fully implement either the national security law or some of the reprisals you talk about. 'But ultimately we need to be honest that we wouldn't be able to force China to allow BNOs to come to the UK.' The Chinese embassy in London insists that 'all Chinese compatriots residing in Hong Kong are Chinese nationals'. 'If the British side makes unilateral changes to the relevant practice, it will breach its own position and pledges as well as international law and basic norms governing international relations,' it in a statement. 'We firmly oppose this and reserve the right to take corresponding measures,' it without elaborating.

HUAWEI AND 5G Beijing has been angered by Western fears that Chinese tech giant Huawei could be used as a front for Communist Party espionage. Huawei has long been lobbying to help build Britain's 5G mobile network, but some politicians fear that Beijing could commandeer the technology to tap into communications. China has previously accused UK ministers of showing 'deep-rooted pride and prejudice' by raising fears about Huawei's involvement. Huawei denies any spying link. In January 2020, Huawei was granted a limited role in the 5G network after the government it could manage the risks and would keep Huawei out of the 'core' of the network, limiting its role to 35 per cent. But US pressure has prompted a rethink in recent weeks. Ministers admitted this week that US sanctions are 'likely to have an impact on the viability of Huawei as a provider'. Britain is now studying ways it can cut Huawei out of its system entirely and build up an alliance of European and Asian providers that reduces China's dominance in the field. CORONAVIRUS CRISIS UK ministers have that China faces a 'reckoning' over its handling of the coronavirus crisis, which started in Wuhan late last year and has killed more than 40,000 people in Britain. Defence Secretary Ben Wallace in May that China has questions to answer about how the disease was allowed to spiral out of control, amid claims that China covered up the outbreak in its earliest days. Britain was among the countries to back Australia's calls for a WHO investigation into the pandemic. China has responded to Australia's pressure with a series of retaliatory measures. China's state-run Global Times stoked further tension in May by saying the UK's response to Covid-19 was 'flippant and ill-prepared' and saying the UK needed a 'miracle' to escape the 'mess' it was in. HUMAN RIGHTS Britain voiced concern about the crackdown in Hong Kong during last year's protests, saying that mass arrests and the use of live ammunition risked 'inflaming tensions'. In addition, Britain was one of 23 countries to voice alarm about Chinese human rights abuses in Xinjiang, where ethnic minority Uighurs have allegedly been detained in 're-education camps'. A joint statement signed by Britain there were 'credible reports of mass detention; efforts to restrict cultural and religious practices; mass surveillance disproportionately targeting ethnic Uighurs; and other human rights violations and abuses'. Britain also urged China to give 'meaningful access' to UN investigators to assess the situation in Xinjiang. INFLUENCE ON BRITAIN'S ELITE A London club packed with political and business elites was caught in a row last month after a book claimed it was being used by China to 'groom' Britain's elites. The pro-China 48 Group Club, which lists Lord Heseltine among its patrons, is taking legal action over the book which suggested that China sees the club as a channel for its lobbying efforts. The club denied being a 'vehicle for Beijing' and it was an 'independent body' promoting 'positive Sino-British relations', The Times reported. Experts have previously warned about Chinese tactics of 'elite capture' by appointing prominent foreigners as well-paid advisers and making them 'more amenable to Communist Party aims'. Advertisement Separately, foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian warned at a daily briefing today that Britain would bear all consequences for any actions it took over Hong Kong. 'All Chinese compatriots in Hong Kong, including those holding the British National (Overseas) passports, are Chinese citizens,' Zhao . 'Before Hong Kong returned, the UK side had clearly promised not to provide the right of abode in Britain for holders of the BNO travel documents. The UK side has ignored the Chinese side's solemn position and insisted on changing the policy to provide a route for the relevant individuals to stay in the UK and obtain UK citizenship. '[The UK's move] has seriously breached its own promises and violates international law and the basic principles of international relations. The Chinese side strongly condemns this and reserves the rights of further reactions. The UK should bear any consequences caused by this.' Zhao no amount of pressure from external forces could 'shake China's determination and will to safeguard national sovereignty and Hong Kong's prosperity and stability', also criticising a US move towards sanctions. Hu Xijin, the editor of the state-run Global Times, struck a different tone by saying that Britain should either grant citizenship immediately or not at all. 'Johnson government should give Hong Kong BNO passport holders UK citizenship, rather than let them go through a long period of uncertainty,' he . 'No matter what's China's official response, Chinese people have no objection to UK opening its arms to Hongkongers who want to leave.' Britain regards the new security law as a breach of the 1984 treaty which agreed the terms of the handover - but China regards it as a historical document with no validity today. China unveiled the details of the security law on Tuesday night after weeks of uncertainty, pushing one of the world's most glittering financial hubs on to a more authoritarian path. Article 38 of the law even appears to claim jurisdiction over 'every person on the planet' for supposed national security crimes committed overseas. Hong Kong returned to China in 1997 under a deal known as 'one country, two systems' which maintained rights such as free speech and an independent judiciary that are unknown on the mainland. Beijing promised to preserve the city's way of life until at least 2047- but critics its special status is now dead. Hong Kong police began their new crackdown on dissent yesterday, boasting of their draconian new powers as they rounded up hundreds of pro-democracy activists including a 15-year-old girl waving an independence flag. Police used water cannons, tear gas and pepper spray to drive protesters back on the 23rd anniversary of the former British colony's return to Chinese rule. Three were injured when a man flying a Hong Kong independence flag rammed his motorbike into a group of officers. Ten people were specifically arrested under the new security law, which lines up long prison sentences for crimes of 'subversion' and 'terrorism' which critics fear could be used to silence dissent. Around 370 were arrested on other charges, including unlawful assembly and possessing weapons. Police that one officer was stabbed in the arm by 'rioters holding sharp objects'. They added that the suspects fled and bystanders offered no help. Authorities later arrested a 24-year-old man at the city's airport in the early hours of Thursday on suspicion of attacking and wounding an officer during protests. A police spokesman the arrested man was surnamed Wong but could not confirm if he was leaving Hong Kong or working at the airport. Wong had purchased a ticket on Wednesday and boarded the flight with no check-in luggage, the official . He did not respond to the air crew who called him by name, and was not at his designated seat. Police identified him after conducting a sweep of the plane. Local media reported he was arrested after a relative tipped off police about his his travel plans.

The writing that read ‘Arise! All those who don’t want to be slaves!’ was spotted Wednesday on the street of Hong Kong. It was revealed after a picture of the graffiti was shared on Twitter by Luke de Pulford, a local human rights activist. Hong Kong protesters have sprayed a graffiti (pictured( quoting lyrics from the Chinese national anthem to urge the city to rise up against Beijing’s crackdown on freedoms The quote came from China’s national anthem, ‘March of the Volunteers’ which refers to several volunteer armies that opposed Japan's invasion of Manchuria in the 1930s. Composed by playwright Tian Han in 1934, the song was initially adopted as a provisional anthem in 1949 by the Communist government. When Tian was imprisoned during the Cultural Revolution in the 1960s, the song was briefly and unofficially replaced by 'The East is Red'. It was restored and became the official Chinese national anthem in 1982. The song also became the national anthem for Hong Kong and Macau following their handovers to China in 1997 and 1999, respectively. Advertisement The new law is seen as Beijing's boldest step yet to bring the semi-autonomous territory under control of the authoritarian mainland. Campaigners the 'one country, two systems' formula which was meant to guarantee Hong Kong's freedoms until 2047 is now dead - but China insists the law is an internal affair targeting only a handful of 'troublemakers'. The law also allows China's feared security agencies to openly set up shop in Hong Kong for the first time, and could open the door for dissidents to be tried on the mainland. An influential group of barristers the law will weaken the independent judiciary which is seen as key to Hong Kong's success as a business hub. Brought in following anti-government protests last year, it outlaws any action deemed to be against the national interest of China. Anyone shouting slogans or holding flags calling for independence is violating the law, regardless of whether violence is used. Even driving a bus full of protesters could be deemed illegal. The most serious offenders will be labelled 'terrorists', transferred to the mainland and receive a maximum sentence of life in jail. One example of a terror act, for example, is attacking public transport, something protesters often did last year. But it also includes providing support or assistance for such acts. 'This would mean many 'moderate' or peaceful supporters of the protest movement would be caught under the law if the extreme protesters they assisted were to be arrested as terrorists,' Hong Kong lawyer Antony Dapiran . Some trials will be held behind closed doors. A new police unit unaccountable to local laws has also been given licence to operate in the territory. Beijing, not Hong Kong, will have power over how the law is interpreted. Ahead of the protest, pro-democracy activist Tsang Kin-shing, of the League of Social Democrats, warned there was a 'large chance of our being arrested'. He : 'The charges will not be light, please judge for yourself.' A man who gave his name as Seth, 35, : 'I'm scared of going to jail but for justice I have to come out today, I have to stand up.' Media tycoon Jimmy Lai the law meant Hong Kong was 'dead'. He added: 'It's worse than the worst scenario imagined. Hong Kong is totally subdued, totally under control.' Mr Lai, 72, who also supported the Tiananmen Square protesters in 1989, thinks Beijing will come for him but is unfazed. 'I cannot worry, because you never know what kind of measures they will take against me,' he .

In a scathing critique, the city's Bar Association the new law dismantles the legal firewall between Hong Kong's independent judiciary - which is seen as crucial to the city's success as a business hub - and China's Communist Party-controlled courts. The Association the new national security offences were 'widely drawn' and 'are capable of being applied in a manner that is arbitrary, and that disproportionately interferes with fundamental rights, including the freedom of conscience, expression and assembly'. 'Lawyers, judges, police and Hong Kong residents were given no opportunity to familiarise themselves with the contents of the new law, including the serious criminal offences it creates, before it came into force,' it . Barristers the law makes clear 'suspects can be removed to face trial in Mainland China' and points out that the process does not have the usual checks and balances of extradition hearings. It noted the law allowed mainland security agents working in Hong Kong to be 'above the reach of local law' and empowering the city's chief executive to appoint judges to oversee national security cases undermined judicial independence. In response, China dismissed the statement as 'unfounded', claiming officials had held dialogue sessions with Hong Kong residents to hear their opinions on the law. 'The lawyers' association's claim... that the law lacked meaningful consultation is totally unfounded,' foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian. Advertisement Hong Kong's Beijing-backed leader Carrie Lam strongly endorsed the new law in her speech marking the 23rd anniversary of the handover yesterday. 'This decision was necessary and timely to maintain Hong Kong's stability,' Lam following a flag-raising ceremony and the playing of China's national anthem. Speaking at the harbour-front venue where the last British governor Chris Patten handed Hong Kong back to Chinese rule, Lam described it as the most important development in the 23 years since then. Mr Raab yesterday rebuked HSBC for supporting the new law, saying that the rights of Hong Kong should not be 'sacrificed on the altar of bankers' bonuses'. HSBC was originally known as the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation. British banking giants HSBC and Standard Chartered - both with a major presence in Hong Kong and on the mainland - joined other firms in publicly backing the law last month. The Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce described the passing of the law earlier this week as 'instrumental in helping to restore stability and certainty to Hong Kong, which has been severely impacted by the social unrest since last year'. 'We need a stable environment which the (security law) aims to provide.' Analysts and members of the business community have the law could add to the risk and complexity of doing business in Hong Kong, but is unlikely to spark an exodus of foreign firms because the city is still seen as the gateway to the Chinese economy. The city's Bar Association, an influential group of barristers, the new law dismantles the legal firewall between Hong Kong's independent judiciary - which is seen as crucial to the city's success as a business hub - and China's Communist Party-controlled courts.

China's move has provoked a backlash around the world. The US House of Representatives last night agreed unanimously to seek tough sanctions on Chinese officials and Hong Kong police. On Thursday, Australian leader Scott Morrison he was 'very actively' considering offering Hong Kongers safe haven. Taiwan has opened an office to help Hong Kongers wanting to flee, while a proposed bill in the United States offering sanctuary to city residents has received widespread bipartisan support. China routinely dismisses all such criticism as interference in its domestic affairs. One of the crimes in the Hong Kong security law explicitly outlaws receiving funding or support from overseas to disrupt lawmaking in Hong Kong or impose sanctions on the city. Amnesty International the new law was a 'far-reaching threat to Hong Kong's freedoms'. Its Asia-Pacific regional director, Nicholas Bequelin, added: 'With its vague language and provisions for secret trials, hand-picked judges and mainland security agencies operating freely in the city, the law is wide open to politically motivated, capricious and arbitrary interpretation by the authorities. 'Hong Kongers are facing an assault by the Beijing authorities and the Hong Kong government on freedoms that they have long enjoyed.' One major cause of alarm is Article 38 of the law which purports to claim jurisdiction over national security offences committed overseas, even by foreigners. 'If you've ever anything that might offend [China] or Hong Kong authorities, stay out of Hong Kong,' Donald Clarke, an expert on Chinese law at George Washington University, wrote in an analysis. 'I know of no reason not to think it means what it appears to : it is asserting extraterritorial jurisdiction over every person on the planet,' Clarke wrote. The UK updated its travel advice on Hong Kong, saying there is an 'increased risk of detention and deportation'. It advised Britons to 'avoid protests and demonstrations.' Political leaders across the spectrum have condemned China's crackdown, which came quicker than anyone expected. But Rod Wye, of the Chatham House think-tank, Beijing will not care as it takes advantage of global instability and rifts opening up between Western powers. 'The USA and EU are moving in different directions in many areas. It is perhaps to China's advantage that that should be so,' he .'Expressions of concern are certainly not going to change the Chinese intention one little bit.'

The former consulate worker was detained in China for over two weeks last August after Beijing accused the former consulate worker of inciting unrest amid mass anti-government demonstrations in Hong Kong. Simon Cheng (pictured) is the first person to have been granted political asylum by the Home Office in relation to China's crackdown on the Hong Kong anti-government movement after he was allegedly shackled, beaten, forced to stand for long hours in secret detention in China Eunice Wong, a Hong Kong student who has just finished her Master's degree in the UK, she would be taking advantage of the offer. 'It's the only option. I don't think I can go back home now. I will be persecuted,' she told The Times. In a separate interview with BBC Radio 5 Live, Ms Wong she would not be able to go home again after talking to foreign media. Thousands of Hong Kong citizens have already expressed their desire to move to Britain on social media platforms. A Facebook group named the 'Official Group for BNO Equality Movement' has seen nearly 3,000 new members in the past month. Numerous Hong Kong websites have published articles explaining the process of applying for the new BNO rights, including one titled 'Things you must know before immigration'. Advertisement The PM is under pressure on Huawei from all sides, with Tory backbenchers repeatedly bringing up the issue in yesterday's Commons debate on Hong Kong. Tom Tugendhat, the chairman of the Foreign Affairs Select Committee, also raised concerns about China's influence on the UK university sector - citing claims that 'Chinese students have already been influenced to silence debate and change outcomes here in the UK'. Labour has also called for Britain to 'develop home grown alternatives' to Chinese technology and make 'a proper assessment of the national security implications' before green-lighting the Huawei deal. Mr Raab told MPs that Huawei's role was currently 'under review' by the National Cyber Security Centre, with ministers no longer sticking by the January deal to let Huawei into 35 per cent of the network and none of its 'core' elements. Unveiling the offer to Hong Kongers, Mr Raab the 'bespoke' new arrangement to be implemented in the coming months would grant BNOs five years' limited leave to remain in the UK with the ability to live and work. They would then be eligible to apply for settled status and would be able to apply for citizenship after 12 months with that status. At the moment, BNOs can travel on a British passport and receive UK diplomatic help but do not have the automatic right to live or work in Britain. The status had to be acquired before 1997 and can no longer be applied for, although 'dependents' of BNO holders will be eligible under the scheme. As of February, there were nearly 350,000 BNO passport holders, while the Government estimates there are around 2.9million BNOs living in Hong Kong. 'This is a special, bespoke set of arrangements developed for the unique circumstances we face and in the light of our historic commitment to the people of Hong Kong,' Mr Raab . However, the Foreign Secretary later 'only a proportion' would be likely to take up the new status. He also that if Beijing tried to stop people with British National (Overseas) status from leaving Hong Kong, there would be little that could be done by the UK. Mr Raab told ITV's Peston programme: 'There is diplomatic leverage, there are other ways that we can persuade China not to fully implement either the national security law or some of the reprisals you talk about. 'But ultimately we need to be honest that we wouldn't be able to force China to allow BNOs to come to the UK.' The Chinese embassy in London insists that 'all Chinese compatriots residing in Hong Kong are Chinese nationals'. 'If the British side makes unilateral changes to the relevant practice, it will breach its own position and pledges as well as international law and basic norms governing international relations,' it in a statement. 'We firmly oppose this and reserve the right to take corresponding measures,' it without elaborating.

HUAWEI AND 5G Beijing has been angered by Western fears that Chinese tech giant Huawei could be used as a front for Communist Party espionage. Huawei has long been lobbying to help build Britain's 5G mobile network, but some politicians fear that Beijing could commandeer the technology to tap into communications. China has previously accused UK ministers of showing 'deep-rooted pride and prejudice' by raising fears about Huawei's involvement. Huawei denies any spying link. In January 2020, Huawei was granted a limited role in the 5G network after the government it could manage the risks and would keep Huawei out of the 'core' of the network, limiting its role to 35 per cent. But US pressure has prompted a rethink in recent weeks. Ministers admitted this week that US sanctions are 'likely to have an impact on the viability of Huawei as a provider'. Britain is now studying ways it can cut Huawei out of its system entirely and build up an alliance of European and Asian providers that reduces China's dominance in the field. CORONAVIRUS CRISIS UK ministers have that China faces a 'reckoning' over its handling of the coronavirus crisis, which started in Wuhan late last year and has killed more than 40,000 people in Britain. Defence Secretary Ben Wallace in May that China has questions to answer about how the disease was allowed to spiral out of control, amid claims that China covered up the outbreak in its earliest days. Britain was among the countries to back Australia's calls for a WHO investigation into the pandemic. China has responded to Australia's pressure with a series of retaliatory measures. China's state-run Global Times stoked further tension in May by saying the UK's response to Covid-19 was 'flippant and ill-prepared' and saying the UK needed a 'miracle' to escape the 'mess' it was in. HUMAN RIGHTS Britain voiced concern about the crackdown in Hong Kong during last year's protests, saying that mass arrests and the use of live ammunition risked 'inflaming tensions'. In addition, Britain was one of 23 countries to voice alarm about Chinese human rights abuses in Xinjiang, where ethnic minority Uighurs have allegedly been detained in 're-education camps'. A joint statement signed by Britain there were 'credible reports of mass detention; efforts to restrict cultural and religious practices; mass surveillance disproportionately targeting ethnic Uighurs; and other human rights violations and abuses'. Britain also urged China to give 'meaningful access' to UN investigators to assess the situation in Xinjiang. INFLUENCE ON BRITAIN'S ELITE A London club packed with political and business elites was caught in a row last month after a book claimed it was being used by China to 'groom' Britain's elites. The pro-China 48 Group Club, which lists Lord Heseltine among its patrons, is taking legal action over the book which suggested that China sees the club as a channel for its lobbying efforts. The club denied being a 'vehicle for Beijing' and it was an 'independent body' promoting 'positive Sino-British relations', The Times reported. Experts have previously warned about Chinese tactics of 'elite capture' by appointing prominent foreigners as well-paid advisers and making them 'more amenable to Communist Party aims'. Advertisement Separately, foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian warned at a daily briefing today that Britain would bear all consequences for any actions it took over Hong Kong. 'All Chinese compatriots in Hong Kong, including those holding the British National (Overseas) passports, are Chinese citizens,' Zhao . 'Before Hong Kong returned, the UK side had clearly promised not to provide the right of abode in Britain for holders of the BNO travel documents. The UK side has ignored the Chinese side's solemn position and insisted on changing the policy to provide a route for the relevant individuals to stay in the UK and obtain UK citizenship. '[The UK's move] has seriously breached its own promises and violates international law and the basic principles of international relations. The Chinese side strongly condemns this and reserves the rights of further reactions. The UK should bear any consequences caused by this.' Zhao no amount of pressure from external forces could 'shake China's determination and will to safeguard national sovereignty and Hong Kong's prosperity and stability', also criticising a US move towards sanctions. Hu Xijin, the editor of the state-run Global Times, struck a different tone by saying that Britain should either grant citizenship immediately or not at all. 'Johnson government should give Hong Kong BNO passport holders UK citizenship, rather than let them go through a long period of uncertainty,' he . 'No matter what's China's official response, Chinese people have no objection to UK opening its arms to Hongkongers who want to leave.' Britain regards the new security law as a breach of the 1984 treaty which agreed the terms of the handover - but China regards it as a historical document with no validity today. China unveiled the details of the security law on Tuesday night after weeks of uncertainty, pushing one of the world's most glittering financial hubs on to a more authoritarian path. Article 38 of the law even appears to claim jurisdiction over 'every person on the planet' for supposed national security crimes committed overseas. Hong Kong returned to China in 1997 under a deal known as 'one country, two systems' which maintained rights such as free speech and an independent judiciary that are unknown on the mainland. Beijing promised to preserve the city's way of life until at least 2047- but critics its special status is now dead. Hong Kong police began their new crackdown on dissent yesterday, boasting of their draconian new powers as they rounded up hundreds of pro-democracy activists including a 15-year-old girl waving an independence flag. Police used water cannons, tear gas and pepper spray to drive protesters back on the 23rd anniversary of the former British colony's return to Chinese rule. Three were injured when a man flying a Hong Kong independence flag rammed his motorbike into a group of officers. Ten people were specifically arrested under the new security law, which lines up long prison sentences for crimes of 'subversion' and 'terrorism' which critics fear could be used to silence dissent. Around 370 were arrested on other charges, including unlawful assembly and possessing weapons. Police that one officer was stabbed in the arm by 'rioters holding sharp objects'. They added that the suspects fled and bystanders offered no help. Authorities later arrested a 24-year-old man at the city's airport in the early hours of Thursday on suspicion of attacking and wounding an officer during protests. A police spokesman the arrested man was surnamed Wong but could not confirm if he was leaving Hong Kong or working at the airport. Wong had purchased a ticket on Wednesday and boarded the flight with no check-in luggage, the official . He did not respond to the air crew who called him by name, and was not at his designated seat. Police identified him after conducting a sweep of the plane. Local media reported he was arrested after a relative tipped off police about his his travel plans.

The writing that read ‘Arise! All those who don’t want to be slaves!’ was spotted Wednesday on the street of Hong Kong. It was revealed after a picture of the graffiti was shared on Twitter by Luke de Pulford, a local human rights activist. Hong Kong protesters have sprayed a graffiti (pictured( quoting lyrics from the Chinese national anthem to urge the city to rise up against Beijing’s crackdown on freedoms The quote came from China’s national anthem, ‘March of the Volunteers’ which refers to several volunteer armies that opposed Japan's invasion of Manchuria in the 1930s. Composed by playwright Tian Han in 1934, the song was initially adopted as a provisional anthem in 1949 by the Communist government. When Tian was imprisoned during the Cultural Revolution in the 1960s, the song was briefly and unofficially replaced by 'The East is Red'. It was restored and became the official Chinese national anthem in 1982. The song also became the national anthem for Hong Kong and Macau following their handovers to China in 1997 and 1999, respectively. Advertisement The new law is seen as Beijing's boldest step yet to bring the semi-autonomous territory under control of the authoritarian mainland. Campaigners the 'one country, two systems' formula which was meant to guarantee Hong Kong's freedoms until 2047 is now dead - but China insists the law is an internal affair targeting only a handful of 'troublemakers'. The law also allows China's feared security agencies to openly set up shop in Hong Kong for the first time, and could open the door for dissidents to be tried on the mainland. An influential group of barristers the law will weaken the independent judiciary which is seen as key to Hong Kong's success as a business hub. Brought in following anti-government protests last year, it outlaws any action deemed to be against the national interest of China. Anyone shouting slogans or holding flags calling for independence is violating the law, regardless of whether violence is used. Even driving a bus full of protesters could be deemed illegal. The most serious offenders will be labelled 'terrorists', transferred to the mainland and receive a maximum sentence of life in jail. One example of a terror act, for example, is attacking public transport, something protesters often did last year. But it also includes providing support or assistance for such acts. 'This would mean many 'moderate' or peaceful supporters of the protest movement would be caught under the law if the extreme protesters they assisted were to be arrested as terrorists,' Hong Kong lawyer Antony Dapiran . Some trials will be held behind closed doors. A new police unit unaccountable to local laws has also been given licence to operate in the territory. Beijing, not Hong Kong, will have power over how the law is interpreted. Ahead of the protest, pro-democracy activist Tsang Kin-shing, of the League of Social Democrats, warned there was a 'large chance of our being arrested'. He : 'The charges will not be light, please judge for yourself.' A man who gave his name as Seth, 35, : 'I'm scared of going to jail but for justice I have to come out today, I have to stand up.' Media tycoon Jimmy Lai the law meant Hong Kong was 'dead'. He added: 'It's worse than the worst scenario imagined. Hong Kong is totally subdued, totally under control.' Mr Lai, 72, who also supported the Tiananmen Square protesters in 1989, thinks Beijing will come for him but is unfazed. 'I cannot worry, because you never know what kind of measures they will take against me,' he .

In a scathing critique, the city's Bar Association the new law dismantles the legal firewall between Hong Kong's independent judiciary - which is seen as crucial to the city's success as a business hub - and China's Communist Party-controlled courts. The Association the new national security offences were 'widely drawn' and 'are capable of being applied in a manner that is arbitrary, and that disproportionately interferes with fundamental rights, including the freedom of conscience, expression and assembly'. 'Lawyers, judges, police and Hong Kong residents were given no opportunity to familiarise themselves with the contents of the new law, including the serious criminal offences it creates, before it came into force,' it . Barristers the law makes clear 'suspects can be removed to face trial in Mainland China' and points out that the process does not have the usual checks and balances of extradition hearings. It noted the law allowed mainland security agents working in Hong Kong to be 'above the reach of local law' and empowering the city's chief executive to appoint judges to oversee national security cases undermined judicial independence. In response, China dismissed the statement as 'unfounded', claiming officials had held dialogue sessions with Hong Kong residents to hear their opinions on the law. 'The lawyers' association's claim... that the law lacked meaningful consultation is totally unfounded,' foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian. Advertisement Hong Kong's Beijing-backed leader Carrie Lam strongly endorsed the new law in her speech marking the 23rd anniversary of the handover yesterday. 'This decision was necessary and timely to maintain Hong Kong's stability,' Lam following a flag-raising ceremony and the playing of China's national anthem. Speaking at the harbour-front venue where the last British governor Chris Patten handed Hong Kong back to Chinese rule, Lam described it as the most important development in the 23 years since then. Mr Raab yesterday rebuked HSBC for supporting the new law, saying that the rights of Hong Kong should not be 'sacrificed on the altar of bankers' bonuses'. HSBC was originally known as the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation. British banking giants HSBC and Standard Chartered - both with a major presence in Hong Kong and on the mainland - joined other firms in publicly backing the law last month. The Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce described the passing of the law earlier this week as 'instrumental in helping to restore stability and certainty to Hong Kong, which has been severely impacted by the social unrest since last year'. 'We need a stable environment which the (security law) aims to provide.' Analysts and members of the business community have the law could add to the risk and complexity of doing business in Hong Kong, but is unlikely to spark an exodus of foreign firms because the city is still seen as the gateway to the Chinese economy. The city's Bar Association, an influential group of barristers, the new law dismantles the legal firewall between Hong Kong's independent judiciary - which is seen as crucial to the city's success as a business hub - and China's Communist Party-controlled courts. Hong Kong restaurant is raided by police for displaying pro-democracy posters A noodle restaurant in Hong Kong has been forced to shut down after police raided the eatery for displaying pro-democracy slogans, pamphlets and figurines.

Many customers have left supportive comments under Mr Lam's post. One commenter wrote: 'They can't tear them down. They are in our hearts.'

China's move has provoked a backlash around the world. The US House of Representatives last night agreed unanimously to seek tough sanctions on Chinese officials and Hong Kong police. On Thursday, Australian leader Scott Morrison he was 'very actively' considering offering Hong Kongers safe haven. Taiwan has opened an office to help Hong Kongers wanting to flee, while a proposed bill in the United States offering sanctuary to city residents has received widespread bipartisan support. China routinely dismisses all such criticism as interference in its domestic affairs. One of the crimes in the Hong Kong security law explicitly outlaws receiving funding or support from overseas to disrupt lawmaking in Hong Kong or impose sanctions on the city. Amnesty International the new law was a 'far-reaching threat to Hong Kong's freedoms'. Its Asia-Pacific regional director, Nicholas Bequelin, added: 'With its vague language and provisions for secret trials, hand-picked judges and mainland security agencies operating freely in the city, the law is wide open to politically motivated, capricious and arbitrary interpretation by the authorities. 'Hong Kongers are facing an assault by the Beijing authorities and the Hong Kong government on freedoms that they have long enjoyed.' One major cause of alarm is Article 38 of the law which purports to claim jurisdiction over national security offences committed overseas, even by foreigners. 'If you've ever anything that might offend [China] or Hong Kong authorities, stay out of Hong Kong,' Donald Clarke, an expert on Chinese law at George Washington University, wrote in an analysis. 'I know of no reason not to think it means what it appears to : it is asserting extraterritorial jurisdiction over every person on the planet,' Clarke wrote. The UK updated its travel advice on Hong Kong, saying there is an 'increased risk of detention and deportation'. It advised Britons to 'avoid protests and demonstrations.' Political leaders across the spectrum have condemned China's crackdown, which came quicker than anyone expected. But Rod Wye, of the Chatham House think-tank, Beijing will not care as it takes advantage of global instability and rifts opening up between Western powers. 'The USA and EU are moving in different directions in many areas. It is perhaps to China's advantage that that should be so,' he .'Expressions of concern are certainly not going to change the Chinese intention one little bit.'

Justice Minister Margarita Cabello described the events at the La Modelo prison in Bogota as an attempted prison escape. But advocates for inmates officials had cracked down on inmates staging a peaceful protest over conditions they feared would exacerbate infections with the virus. 'Today is a sad and painful day for the country,' Cabello .

Violence broke out in the prison out of inmates' fears that authorities are not doing enough to prevent coronavirus inside prisons Inmates shared videos online showing people outside their cells, yelling as shots rang out in the distance. 'They have us abandoned here!' one inmate exclaimed. 'They have us like dogs.' On Sunday, evidence of the violence was still visible. The body of one man lay face-up on a roof, dressed in bright blue shorts, white sneakers and a bloody grey sweatshirt. Family members, many wearing protective masks, gathered outside, trying to get any information they could. 'We're desperate because we don't know anything,' one woman cried. Authorities did not provide a detailed account of how the inmates died, saying only that seven jail workers had also been injured, two critically. Cabello no inmates had escaped and that to date, none had been diagnosed with coronavirus either. 'This was a criminal attempt to escape that was thwarted,' she in a video statement. The relative of an inmate cries outside La Modelo jail in Bogota, Colombia after the riot which killed 23 people Jhon Leon, director of Judicial Solidarity, an organization that works to improve inmate conditions, prisoners had planned a nationwide protest Saturday evening after complaining about the dire state of jails for two weeks without getting a reply. The National Prison Movement, a group of inmates and their relatives, released a statement earlier in the week, saying Colombia's prisons don't have enough doctors and nurses on staff, nor sufficient medicines to treat basic illnesses. 'Those deprived of liberty raise our voices in rejection of the policies and ineffective actions that have been taken,' the group . Leon about 5,000 people housed in the jail, some of whom are kept six to a cell while others sleep in hallways. Prisoners want elderly inmates and those with preexisting conditions to be moved to other locations and be put in isolation, he . They also want more information on whether any inmates have been tested for the coronavirus. Inmates point from inside of La Modelo jail in Bogota. Colombia had confirmed 231 coronavirus cases and two deaths as of Sunday 'This was a peaceful protest,' Leon . 'The response of authorities was overhanded.' Colombia had confirmed 231 coronavirus cases and two deaths as of Sunday. But with notoriously overcrowded and often violent prisons, many are concerned that the virus could spread quickly there. For most people, the new coronavirus causes only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever or coughing. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia. The government has taken a handful of initial measures, including barring relatives from visiting inmates. The relative of an inmate cries outside La Modelo jail in Bogota. Family members are searching for more information about what happened The penitentiary service also it is reducing the number of workers in certain areas to create more distance between people, allowing older workers and those with preexisting conditions to stay home and organizing disinfection cleaning crews. One group of 10 inmates has been employed to create masks. But human rights advocates want the government to go further, taking measures like freeing those about to finish their sentences or who are jailed as a preventative measure for non-violent crimes. On Sunday, evidence of the violence was still visible. The body of one man lay face-up on a roof, dressed in bright blue shorts, white sneakers and a bloody grey sweatshirt As of early 2019, there were 120,000 inmates in Colombia's jails, far beyond the official capacity to hold about 80,000 prisoners.

Blood is seen on the floor of the state-owned TC television after unidentified gunmen burst into the studio Police officers arrest one of the unidentified gunmen who burst into a studio of the state-owned TC television studio People accused of invading and taking over television station TC with weapons and forcing staff to lie and sit down, lie handcuffed on the floor Police in Ecuador arrested several of the people who allegedly stormed the TV studio They were handcuffed with zip ties and placed face-down on the floor In the attack on Tuesday evening, intruders forced terrified TV crew onto the ground and a person could be heard screaming in apparent pain as the studio lights went off but the live broadcast continued for at least 15 minutes. Why has violence spiralled in Ecuador? The country has been beset with violence from gangs battling for control in spiralling turf wars that see gun massacres and beheadings. Ecuador is situated between world-leading cocaine producers Colombia and Peru and has become a centre for foreign and domestic drug cartels. Guayaquil, a coastal city that is Ecuador's largest, is considered the country's most dangerous, with its ports a hub for drug smuggling. Noboa took office in November touting his 'Phoenix Plan' for security, including a new intelligence unit, tactical weapons for security forces, new high-security prisons and reinforced security at ports and airports. Security in Ecuador has been worsening since the coronavirus pandemic, which also brutally battered the economy. Ecuador's prisons have become a hotbed of violence, with the cartels fighting for power inside the country's jails, from which they then exert vast influence. Fishermen have been massacred at ports, maimed bodies have been hanged from bridges and riots have left hundreds dead in prisons. Prisons have become a hotbed of violence, with the cartels fighting for power inside the country's jails, from which they then exert vast influence. Since 2018, the national murder rate has more than quadrupled, soaring from six to 26 per 100,000 inhabitants - a rate that places it in the worst 15 countries. The country's National Police tallied 3,568 violent deaths in the first six months of 2023, far more than the 2,042 reported during the same period in 2022. That year ended with 4,600 violent deaths, the country's highest in history and double the total in 2021. Violent deaths nationally rose to 8,008 in 2023, the government has , nearly double the 2022 figure. Violence in Ecuador culminated in August with the assassination of presidential candidate Fernando Villavicencio, plunging the country into chaos. A national emergency was declared in the wake of the assassination, while Ecuador's economic capital, Guayaquil, has seen multiple successive states of emergency imposed. In the north, the city of Esmeraldas is also frequently at the centre of turf wars, as cartels battle for control over the country's key drug supply routes. Behind the violence is what the UN's Office on Drugs and Crime describes as a global 'prolonged surge in both the supply of and demand for cocaine'. As the US market turns to other drugs such as fentanyl, the European market has bolstered demand for the powder, with gangs in the Balkans as well as Italy's feared 'Ndrangheta mafia understood to have expanded into Ecuador.

Journalists on screen were reportedly heard screaming 'they want to kill us all'. One of the hooded men who attacked the set reportedly : 'We are on the air so that they know that we do not play with the mafia.' After about 30 minutes of chaos, police officers were seen entering the studio while someone then called out that they 'have a wounded companion.' All the gunmen who broke into the studio were arrested, a police commander . Alina Manrique, the head of news for TC Television, she was in the control room across from the studio when the masked men entered the building. One of the men pointed a gun at her head and told her to get on the floor, she . Some of the assailants ran from the studio and tried to hide elsewhere in the building when they realised they were surrounded by police, she added. 'I am still in shock,' Ms Manrique told the Associated Press in a phone interview. 'Everything has collapsed. 'All I know is that it's time to leave this country, and go very far away.' Shortly after the gunmen stormed the TV station, President Noboa issued another decree designating 20 drug trafficking gangs operating in the country as terrorist groups and authorising Ecuador's military to 'neutralise' the groups - within the bounds of international humanitarian law. Ecuador's national police chief announced a short time later that authorities had arrested all the masked intruders. Cesar Zapata told the TV channel Teleamazonas that officers had seized the guns and explosives. He did not how many people were arrested. 'This is an act that should be considered as a terrorist act,' Mr Zapata added. President Noboa decreed a national state of emergency for 60 days on Monday, allowing the authorities to suspend rights and mobilize the military in places like prisons. The government also imposed a curfew from 11pm to 5am. Noboa had vowed on Monday to 'not negotiate with terrorists nor rest until we return peace to all Ecuadorans.' He added that his government had decided to confront crime. Noboa was elected in October on a pledge to fight rampant drug-related crime and violence in the South American country - once considered a bastion of peace, but now a key stop on the US- and Europe-bound cocaine trade. He vowed Monday to bring the fight to the cartels after a powerful gang leader, Adolfo Macias, known as 'Fito,' escaped from prison the previous day.

Authorities reported multiple explosions and seven police officers had been kidnapped. They were taken in the coastal city of Machala, in the capital Quito, and in the southwestern province of Los Rios. A chilling video circulating on social media showed three of the kidnapped officers sitting on the ground with a gun pointed at them as one is forced to read a statement addressed to Noboa. 'You declared war, you will get war,' the clearly terrified officer reads. 'You declared a state of emergency. We declare police, civilians and soldiers to be the spoils of war.'

The government has not how many attacks were registered in total, but local media reported several, including some in northern cities, where vehicles were set on fire, and others in Quito, including an explosion near the house of the president of the National Justice Court. Authorities have not if the incidents are part an orchestrated action. Neighbouring country Peru's government declared an emergency along its northern border on Tuesday. Prime Minister Alberto Otarola made the announcement, noting that the emergency declaration would deploy an unspecified number of army troops to support police forces. Peru's defense and interior ministers will also travel to the border to coordinate operations, according to the prime minister. Earlier in the day, Peru's interior minister ordered the 'immediate' deployment of police to the border in a bid to boost security. The Ecuadorian government has previously accused members of the main drug gangs for similar strikes. The US State Department on Tuesday it was 'extremely concerned' by violence in Ecuador which has led the country's president to declare a state of emergency and deploy military into the streets. 'Extremely concerned by today's violence & kidnappings in Ecuador,' the top US diplomat for Latin America, Brian Nichols, wrote on X, adding that American officials would 'remain in close contact' with President Daniel Noboa's team.

Email chris.matthews@mailonline.co.uk"", ""Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has finally broken her silence on Cuba and blamed the unrest on America's 'absurdly cruel' embargoes and blasted President Joe Biden for defending the 'Trump-era restrictions'. 'We are seeing Cubans rise up and protest for their rights like never before. We stand in solidarity with them, and we condemn the anti-democratic actions led by President Diaz-Canel. The suppression of the media, speech and protest are all gross violations of civil rights,' AOC wrote in a statement posted on Twitter. 'We also must name the U.S. contribution to Cuban suffering: our sixty-year-old embargo. Last month, once again, the U.N. voted overwhelmingly to call on the United States to lift its embargo on Cuba. 'The embargo is absurdly cruel and, like too many other U.S. policies targeting Latin Americans, the cruelty is the point. I outright reject the Biden administration's defense of the embargo. It is never acceptable for us to use cruelty as a point of leverage against every day people.' On Thursday, Biden called communism a 'failed system' and 'I don't see socialism as a very useful substitute' after Florida Democrats and Republicans including Ron DeSantis pushed him to condemn the regime. For days after the protests started, the Biden administration refused to mention communism and instead the social turmoil was the result of 'government mismanagement'. Biden there were a 'number of things' his administration could to help the Cuban people but he expressed concern the communist-led government would take control of any aid sent there, such as remittances or COVID vaccines. 'They've cut off access to the internet. We're considering whether we have the technology to reinstate that access.' The widespread internet blackouts are believed to have been sparked by the government during the crackdown on protesters in the streets of Cuba. AOC's response to the crisis in Cuba mirrors a Black Lives Matter statement on Thursday, which blamed the 'cruel and inhumane' US for the current unrest in Cuba and praised the Communist regime for its 'solidarity' with oppressed people. BLM accused the US of causing the instability with its embargoes which have caused 'pain and suffering' for Cubans for 60 years in the message which was branded 'worse than embarrassing'. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has finally broken her silence on Cuba and blamed the unrest on America's 'absurdly cruel' embargoes and blasted President Joe Biden for defending the 'Trump-era restrictions' Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has finally broken her silence on Cuba and blamed the unrest on America's 'inhumane' embargoes in a statement posted on Twitter Thousands of Cubans took part in rare protests Sunday against the communist government, marching through a town chanting 'Down with the dictatorship' and 'We want liberty' Cuban supporters waved flags and honked car horns in support of the Cuban people in Little Havana, Miami on Monday The Bronx Congresswoman tweeted after she and former presidential candidate Bernie Sanders came under fire for their lack of public response to anti-government protests that began in Cuba over the weekend. Sanders broke his silence on Tuesday and demanded the US end its embargo which 'has only hurt, not helped the Cuban people' and urged the communist nation's government to refrain from violence against the island's protesters and opposition. 'All people have the right to protest and to live in a democratic society,' Vermont Sen. Sanders tweeted. 'I call on the Cuban government to respect opposition rights and refrain from violence. It's also long past time to end the unilateral U.S. embargo on Cuba, which has only hurt, not helped, the Cuban people.' In Miami, home to a large community of Cuban Americans, hundreds turned out in Little Havana to express solidarity and celebrate what they viewed as the beginning of the end. On Twitter, Miami mayor Francis Suarez implored the United States to 'take action.' President Joe Biden called communism a 'failed system' during his joint press conference with German Chancellor Angela Merkel The Liberty Rally took place outside the Miami Cuban restaurant Cafe Versailles, a community hub A show of support continued Monday at Miami Cuban restaurant Cafe Versailles as supporters gathered for a 'liberty' rally Cubans are seen outside Havana's Capitol during a demonstration against the government of Cuban President Miguel Diaz-Canel in Havana, on Sunday There remains tension in Cuba following the historic protests, while support grows in South Florida for the Cuban people The protests in Cuba marked some of the biggest displays of antigovernment sentiment in the tightly controlled country in years. Cuba is going through its worst economic crisis in decades, along with a resurgence of coronavirus cases, as it suffers the consequences of U.S. sanctions imposed by former President Donald Trump's administration. Large contingents of Cuban police patrolled the capital, Havana, on Monday following rare protests around the island nation against food shortages and high prices amid the coronavirus crisis. Cuba's president, Miguel Díaz-Canel, the demonstrations were stirred up on social media by Cuban Americans in the United States. Some Republican lawmakers, including Florida Governor Ron DeSantis and Texas Senator Ted Cruz, have praised the protests despite regularly villainizing protesters in their own states 'Florida supports the people of Cuba as they take to the streets against the tyrannical regime in Havana. The Cuban dictatorship has repressed the people of Cuba for decades & is now trying to silence those who have the courage to speak out against its disastrous policies,' DeSantis tweeted Sen. Lindsey Graham encouraged the Biden administration to get involved, telling the White House not to be 'AWOL' In a post shared to its 4.5million Instagram followers, BLM : 'Black Lives Matter condemns the US federal government's inhumane treatment of Cubans, and urges it to immediately lift the economic embargo. 'This cruel and inhumane policy, instituted with the explicit intention of destabilizing the country and undermining Cubans' right to choose their own government, is at the heart of Cuba's current crisis. 'Since 1962, the United States has forced pain and suffering on the people of Cuba by cutting off food, medicine and supplies, costing the tiny island nation an estimated $130billion. 'Without that money, it is harder for Cuba to acquire medical equipment needed to develop its own Covid-19 vaccines and equipment for food production. This comes in spite of the country's strong medical care and history of lending doctors and nurses to disasters around the world.' On Monday, Secretary of State Antony Blinken denied claims the US was to blame for the unrest. He a mismanaged economy was the root of the problems, which have seen people take to the streets. BLM's statement continued: 'The people of Cuba are being punished by the US government because the country has maintained its commitment to sovereignty and self-determination. 'United States leaders have tried to crush this revolution for decades. Instead of international amity, respect and goodwill, the US government has only instigated suffering for the country's 11 million people - of which four million are Black and Brown. 'Cuba has historically demonstrated solidarity with oppressed peoples of African descent, from protecting Black revolutionaries like Assata Shakur through granting her asylum, to supporting Black liberation struggles in Angola, Mozambique, Guinea Bissau and South Africa. 'Now, we look to President Biden to end the embargo, something Barack Obama called for in 2016. This embargo is a blatant human rights violation and it must come to an end.' Shakur, a former member of the Black Liberation Army, was convicted of being an accomplice to the murder of State Trooper Werner Foerster in 1973. At the time, she was also wanted for several felonies, including bank robber counts in New York and was known for her membership of the Black Panthers. Shakur was with two other people when they were pulled over on the New Jersey Turnpike. The three opened fire on the troopers. Passenger James Coston was shot and killed by Officer James Harper. The shootout continued until Shakur, having shot and killed Foerster execution-style fled the scene with the surviving passenger, who remains in prison. Both were apprehended by police shortly thereafter. As the protests took place in Cuba, supporters flooded the streets of Miami's Little Havana neighborhood to show support The show of support continued both on Sunday and Monday at Miami Cuban restaurant Cafe Versailles, where supporters gathered for a 'liberty' rally Hundreds packed 8th Street on Monday in Miami in Little Havana as Cuban-Americans called for change People on the island and in South Florida remain vocal and hopeful for progress Cafe Versailles has been serving tasty Cuban cuisine and culture to the South Florida community and tourists from around the world for four decades and is a hub of the Little Havana community Demonstrators are pictured on Monday evening in Little Havana. Another demonstration is expected Tuesday at 5pm The White House responded to the accusation saying: 'That's simply inaccurate,' 'There's every indication that yesterday's protests were reactions of the people in Cuba to exhaustion of the governance of the leaders of the state,' White House press secretary Jen Psaki on Monday at her daily briefing. Díaz-Canel denounced vandalism that took place during the demonstrations. 'They threw stones at foreign currency shops, they stole items... and at police forces, they turned over cars - a totally vulgar, indecent and delinquent behavior,' he . But the president pro-government supporters had finally restored order after instructing them to fight back and 'defend the revolution' - orders that caused consternation among some Cubans. In Miami, where many Cubans who opposed Fidel Castro's regime fled after the Cuban Revolution, opponents of the revolutionary leaders started marching in solidarity with protesters still on the island. Some Republican lawmakers, including Florida Governor Ron DeSantis and Texas Senator Ted Cruz, have praised the protests despite regularly villainizing protesters in their own states.

The Cuban dictatorship has repressed the people of Cuba for decades & is now trying to silence those who have the courage to speak out against its disastrous policies,' DeSantis tweeted. 'The Communist Cuban regime will be consigned to the dustbin of history. It has brutalized & denied freedom to generations of Cubans, and forced my family & so many others to flee. The American people stand squarely with the men & women of Cuba and their noble fight for liberty,' Senator Cruz tweeted. In Miami, a group of Cuban exiles and local conservative activists from Venezuela, Colombia and Nicaragua called for people in the city to support Cuba and called for the Biden administration to intervene in the aftermath of massive protests on the island.

They're in the streets demanding freedom,' Orlando Gutierrez-Boronat, a Cuban exile and member of the Assembly for Cuban Resistance, based in Miami.

They're not asking for boats, they're not asking for planes or visas. They're asking for freedom', he . In Havana, many young people took part in the demonstrations. Protests were also held elsewhere on the island, including in the small town of San Antonio de los Baños, where people objected to power outages and were visited by President Miguel Díaz-Canel. He entered a few homes, where he took questions from residents. Authorities appeared determined to put a stop to the demonstrations. More than a dozen protesters were detained, including a leading Cuban dissident who was arrested trying to attend a march in the city of Santiago, 550 miles east. The demonstrators disrupted traffic in the capital for several hours until some threw rocks and police moved in and broke them up.

'We stand with the Cuban people and their clarion call for freedom and relief from the tragic grip of the pandemic and from the decades of repression and economic suffering to which they have been subjected by Cuba's authoritarian regime,' Biden . 'The U.S. urges the Cuban government to serve their people rather than enriching themselves,'' Biden added. 'The Cuban people are demanding their freedom from an authoritarian regime. I don't think we've seen anything like these protests in a long long time if, quite frankly ever,' the president . 'The US stands firmly with the people of Cuba as they assert their universal rights. And we call on the government of Cuba to refrain from violence in their attempt to silence the voices of the people of Cuba.' U.N. deputy spokesman Farhan Haq on Monday stressed the U.N. position 'on the need for freedom of expression and peaceful assembly to be respected fully, and we expect that that will be the case.' The demonstrations were extremely unusual on an island where little dissent against the government is tolerated. The last major public demonstration of discontent, over economic hardship, took place nearly 30 years in 1994. Last year, there were small demonstrations by artists and other groups, but nothing as big or widespread as what erupted this past weekend.

Later, about 300 pro-government protesters arrived with a large Cuban flag, shouting slogans in favor of the late President Fidel Castro and the Cuban revolution. Some assaulted a video journalist with the AP, smashing his camera. Photojournalist Ramón Espinosa also of the AP was then beaten by a group of police officers in uniforms and civilian clothes; he suffered a broken nose and an eye injury. The demonstration grew to a few thousand in the vicinity of Galeano Avenue and the marchers pressed on despite a few charges by police officers and tear gas barrages. People standing on many balconies along the central artery in the Centro Habana neighborhood applauded the protesters passing by. Others joined in the march. About 2 1/2 hours into the march, some protesters pulled up cobblestones and threw them at police, at which point officers began arresting people and the marchers dispersed. At least 20 people were taken away in police cars or by individuals in civilian clothes. Although many people tried to take out their cellphones and broadcast the protest live, Cuban authorities shut down internet service throughout the afternoon Sunday. On Monday, Cuban authorities were once again blocking Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram and Telegram, Alp Toker, director of Netblocks, a London-based internet monitoring firm confirmed. 'This does seem to be a response to social media-fueled protest,' he . Twitter did not appear to be blocked, though Toker noted Cuba has the ability to cut it off if it wants to.""]"

Documents presented by Facebook whistleblower Frances Haugen show how multiple studies were run producing a number various number detailing the types of users who were most likely to share fake news. Lawmakers, academics and the White House urged Facebook to share such information publicly. Facebook employees also knew misinformation about the coronavirus was dominating parts of the social media platform creating 'echo-chamber-like effects' ultimately reinforcing hesitancy over the vaccine. Researchers at Facebook were well aware that misinformation about coronavirus was spreading across its platform but did little to prevent it White House press secretary Jen Psaki on Wednesday that it is 'unfortunately not surprising' for the administration to learn that Facebook knew of its problems with vaccine misinformation The trove of documents shows that in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, Facebook carefully investigated how its platforms spread misinformation about life-saving vaccines. They also reveal rank-and-file employees regularly suggested solutions for countering anti-vaccine content on the site, to no avail. Facebook's internal discussions were revealed in disclosures made to the Securities and Exchange Commission and provided to Congress in redacted form by former Facebook employee-turned-whistleblower Frances Haugen's legal counsel. Some researchers detailed how postings by professional organizations such as the World Health Organization, were flooded by anti-vaccine comments essentially hijacking the pro-vaccine message and further spreading falsehoods. The scale of the problem is known only to Facebook and it is not being shared with the White House, however social media platform was acutely aware that vaccine misinformation was a huge problem on its sites. Anti-vaxxers protested on Times Square against vaccination mandates earlier this month But when communicating with the public both in testimony before Congress and blog posts, execs stressed the positive response by the social media network and just how many pieces of misinformation it had removed including helping its users to find vaccination points closer to them. 'For months, I've repeatedly requested information from Facebook about covid misinformation, including questions about which users post it, how the platform amplifies it, how Facebook decides what to remove, and much more,' Rep. Anna G. Eshoo (D-Calif.) to The Washington Post. 'I asked these questions because policymakers need to understand how covid misinformation spreads and how we can mitigate its harmful effects on vaccine hesitancy and public health. It was the whistleblower documents that shed light on these issues, instead of Facebook releasing them a long time ago,' Eshoo continued. Facebook have released their own statement on the situation stressing the company worked to promote reliable information about coronavirus throughout the pandemic. The company noted vaccine hesitancy among U.S. Facebook users has gone down by 50 percent since January. 'There's no silver bullet to fighting misinformation, which is why we take a comprehensive approach which includes removing more than 20 million pieces of content that break our covid misinformation policies … connecting more than 2 billion people to reliable information about covid-19 and vaccines, and partnering with independent fact-checkers,' Spokesperson Aasron Simpson . Protesters against vaccine and mask mandates demonstrate near Santa Fe, New Mexico. New documents raise questions about how Facebook responded to anti-vaccine content White House press secretary Jen Psaki on Wednesday that it is 'unfortunately not surprising' for the administration to learn that Facebook knew of its problems with vaccine misinformation. 'While social media plays an important role in society, it is clear that we need a whole of society approach to end this pandemic,' Facebook Vice President Guy Rosen wrote in a blog. 'Facts — not allegations — should help inform that effort.' 'We've continued to see platforms regularly amplify anti-vaccine content over accurate information,' Psaki . 'That's the basic problem. And that's what we continue to see happen.' Facebook 'set the stage … by allowing vast numbers of conspiracies to be promoted on their platform so people don't trust the experts,' Hany Farid, a computer science researcher . The internal documents show how Facebook employees were even able to see how pieces of misinformation spread. One post was noted to have racked up 53,000 re-shares and upwards of 3 million impressions after an error with Facebook's algorithms. Rep. Eshoo asked for the company to provide information on how often misinformation was being looked at on the site and whether advertisers were being alerted, but the company ignored her request. 'At this time, we have nothing to share in response to the questions you have raised, outside of what Mark Zuckerberg has publicly,' the company wrote in response, one month later. Facebook employees were essentially facing a losing battle as they tried to combat misinformation with the possibility that any post could potentially go viral at any time. Comments were as bad as the postings in many cases and almost impossible to police. 'Vaccine hesitancy in comments is rampant,' stated one researcher. Prior to 2019, the company did not interfere with content that was anti-vaccine but it did stop recommending pages and groups with vaccine misinformation. The company began the crackdown in earnest during the pandemic started blocking adverts that contained inaccurate information on vaccines. In December the company began removed posts that spread misinformation about the safety, side effects, efficacy or ingredients of the vaccines. On Thursday, Facebook announced its parent company was rebranding will now go by the name Meta as Mark Zuckerberg tries to distance the social media behemoth from mounting scandals. Zuckerberg made the announcement at the Facebook Connect augmented and virtual reality conference. Meta refers to the 'metaverse,' Zuckerberg's vision for the company's transition into shared augmented reality, where uses work and play in virtual world environments. The attempt to escape reality couldn't come at a better time for the embattled brand, which will retain the Facebook name, but Facebook Inc. - the parent company that also owns Instagram and WhatsApp - will now go under the new title Meta. It will begin trading under MVRS on December 1. Facebook changed its name to Meta in reference to its goal of expanding beyond social media, CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced Thursday at the Facebook Connect augmented and virtual reality conference Employees pulled down a curtain draped over its iconic 'Like' sign outside the company's Silicon Valley headquarters was pulled down to reveal the new branding It includes a new logo depicting a blue infinity symbol and refers to the 'metaverse', the company's new focus to expand beyond its social media apps Haugen, a Facebook former product manager, left the company with tens of thousands of confidential documents that she copied in secret and released to roughly two dozen news outlets. She testified before Congress on October 5 and the British Parliament on Monday, presenting findings on the harm social media caused young users. One revealed that 13.5% of British teenagers and 6% of American teenagers experiencing suicidal thoughts that they traced them to Instagram. A message posted on an internal message board in March 2020 and revealed in Haugen's documents the app revealed that 32% of girls Instagram made them feel worse about their bodies if they were already having insecurities. Another recent claim against the company is that Instagram bombards women and girls who suffer from eating disorders with images and videos of exceedingly thin females and others afflicted with anorexia. Internal documents revealed that Instagram's algorithm curates options based on searches and preferences of users who express interest in dieting, weight loss, and thinness. Instagram researchers this year conducted an experiment in which they typed in terms like #skinny and #thin are then offered to browse through other accounts that feature dangerously emaciated women and girls. Another core finding in the leaked documents was that Facebook staff have reported for years that they are concerned about the company's failure to police hate speech and that its algorithms flooded users with extremist content and conspiracy theories based on their political beliefs. Internal messages from staff at the social media giant show that they blamed themselves for the January 6 Capitol riot after giving extremist content a platform on the site. 'One of the darkest days in the history of democracy and self-governance. History will not judge us kindly,' one worker while another : 'We've been fueling this fire for a long time and we shouldn't be surprised it's now out of control.' Haugen's leaked documents also reveal that Facebook potentially mislead the US Securities and Exchange Commission by failing to disclose that its popularity among young users is slumping. It is to have failed to explain that many of its overall users are people with more than one account on its sites, meaning the actual number of users could be up to 11% fewer than its figures would suggest. One trend shows that the time spent on Facebook by U.S. teenagers was down 16% from 2020 to 2021 and that young adults, between 18 and 29, were spending 5% less time on the app, according to reporting from Bloomberg. Facebook whistleblower Frances Haugen testifying before British lawmakers on Monday about her concerns over the tech giant's power in the tech and telecomms space. She , among other things, that Facebook misleads the world by claiming it helps non-English-speaking companies with its technology, when it in fact fuels extremism Despite an avalanche of damaging whistleblower claims surfacing at the start of this week in what became known as the Facebook Papers, Meta on Monday reported soaring profits for the latest quarter. The company that its net income grew 17% in the July-September period to $9.19 billion, buoyed by strong advertising revenue. That's up from profits of $7.85 billion a year earlier. Meta stock rose more than 1% in after-hours trading Tuesday and rose by more than 3% on Thursday afternoon before dropping to about 1.5% by 5pm. Third quarter revenue grew 35% to $29.01 billion, exceeding analyst expectations. The company's name change includes a new logo depicting a blue infinity symbol and refers to the 'metaverse', its new focus to expand beyond its social media apps. The term 'metaverse' can refer to digital spaces, which are made more lifelike by the use of virtual reality or augmented reality. 'Our mission remains the same, it's still about bringing people together,' he , adding, 'Now we have a new North Star to help bring the metaverse to life.' He added that the word means 'beyond' in Greek and symbolizes that there is 'always more to build' and 'always a next chapter in the story.' 'I believe the metaverse is the next chapter of the Internet and it's the next chapter of our company too,' he , adding, 'While most etch companies focus on how people could connect to technology, we focus on building technology so people could connect with each other.' Zuckerberg has previously suggested the metaverse to be the future of the company, and has been talking up the metaverse since July. The company has invested heavily in virtual reality and augmented reality, developing hardware such as its Oculus VR headsets and working on AR glasses and wristband technologies. The buzzy word, first coined in a dystopian novel three decades earlier, is popular in Silicon Valley and has been referenced by other tech firms such as Microsoft. In addition to its name change, Meta also announced an upcoming virtual reality headset called Project Cambria, a high-end product available to be released next year at a higher price point than the $299 Quest 2 headset, the company in a blog post. Meta also announced the code name of its first fully AR-capable smart glasses: Project Nazare. The glasses are 'still a few years out,' the company in a blog post and Zuckerberg noted, 'we still have a ways to go with Nazare, but we're making good progress.' The move to Meta is reminiscent of when Google abruptly renamed itself Alphabet in 2015, making Google a subsidiary and allowing it to become a technology conglomerate. Meta is set to trade under MVRS from December 1. The company's stock rose more than 1 percent in after-hours trading Tuesday and rose by more than 3% on Thursday Zuckerberg has previously suggested the metaverse to be future of the company, and has been talking up the metaverse since July In the metaverse, users' avatars move and change their expression in real time with the user But the burning question on the minds of many is whether the name is enough to help Meta shake off it's mounting public relations nightmares. For the company's independent oversight board, the answer is no. The group released a statement shortly after the announcement, saying, 'Changing their name doesn't change reality: Facebook is destroying our democracy and is the world's leading peddler of disinformation and hate.' It continued, 'Their meaningless name change should not distract from the investigation, regulation and real, independent oversight needed to hold Facebook accountable.' The company is attempting to 'divert the conversation from their current problems onto the metaverse, which is exciting and futuristic,' Anne Olderog, a senior partner at the consulting firm Vivaldi with 20 years of brand-strategy experience, told Business Insider. She called it a 'brilliant move' because 'truly, nobody understands' the metaverse. However, she added that the public could 'definitely see through things like that at this stage.' 'Facebook is the world's social media platform and they are being accused of creating something that is harmful to people and society,' marketing consultant Laura Ries told the Associated Press. She compared the name Meta to when BP rebranded to 'Beyond Petroleum' to escape criticism that it harmed the environment. 'They can't walk away from the social network with a new corporate name and talk of a future metaverse.' The company has invested heavily in virtual reality and augmented reality, developing hardware such as its Oculus VR headsets and working on AR glasses and wristband technologies In addition to a new drop of documents from Haugen last Monday that became known as the Facebook Papers, U.S. officials announced Meta had agreed to pay up to $14.25 million to settle civil claims by the government that the company discriminated against American workers and violated federal recruitment rules. And last Tuesday in the U.K., the company was fined $70 million after failing to provide enough important information to the competition regulator investigating the firm's takeover of GIF sharing platform Giphy. Britain's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) launched a probe into the acquisition in June last year, shortly after the deal was announced, over concerns about a 'substantial lessening of competition.' Facebook responded to the fine, saying: 'We strongly disagree with the CMA's unfair decision to punish Facebook for a best effort compliance approach, which the CMA itself ultimately approved. We will review the CMA's decision and consider our options.' Facebook has also admitted that users can share information about how to enter countries illegally and about people smuggled on its social media platforms. The admission comes as Arizona Attorney General Mark Brnovich urged the Department of Justice and US Attorney General Merrick Garland to investigate the social media giant over its 'facilitation' of illegal migration into the United States. The move could benefit the California-based behemoth's reputation, which has suffered hit after hit in recent years. The company had been facing a number of scandals long before its controversy over the Facebook Papers. It was accused of facilitating the spread of misinformation during the 2016 US presidential election, prompting a a series of congressional hearings and policy changes, including the introduction of third-party fact-checkers and further transparency in political advertising. In 2019, the Federal Trade Commission fined Facebook $5 billion for allowing 87 million US profiles to be harvested for information used for political advertising by British firm Cambridge Analytica. Some of the advertising was used to help the 2016 campaign of former president Donald Trump. When announcing the new name, Zuckerberg paid no notice to any of the scandals or Facebook Papers, but focused solely on Meta's goals going forward. Those familiar with the popular children's game Roblox already know the metaverse as it describes itself as a metaverse company. Epic Games' Fortnite is also considered to be part of the metaverse. The metaverse is 'going to be a big focus, and I think that this is just going to be a big part of the next chapter for the way that the internet evolves after the mobile internet,' Zuckerberg told The Verge earlier this year. 'And I think it's going to be the next big chapter for our company too, really doubling down in this area.' On Sunday, Meta announced it was hiring 10,000 people in Europe to build the metaverse out."", ""Whistleblowers at social media giant Facebook are saying the company didn't do enough to stop the spread of misinformation in the days and weeks leading up to, as well as during, the Capitol riot on January 6. New internal documents provided by former Facebook employee-turned-whistleblower Frances Haugen provide a rare glimpse into how the company appears to have simply stumbled into the Jan. 6 riot. Reports that in California, Facebook engineers were racing to tweak internal controls to slow the spread of misinformation and inciteful content. Emergency actions - some of which were rolled back after the 2020 election - included banning Trump, freezing comments in groups with a record for hate speech, filtering out the 'Stop the Steal' rallying cry and empowering content moderators to act more assertively by labeling the U.S. a 'Temporary High Risk Location' for political violence. At the same time, frustration inside Facebook erupted over what some saw as the company's halting and often reversed response to rising extremism in the U.S. Former Facebook employee Frances Haugen (pictured above) has provided new details on the company's response to the Capitol riot Five people died in the insurrection, which attempted to stop American electors from certifying the 2020 Presidential Election for Joe Biden Within Facebook, there were complaints that the company hadn't done enough to stop the spread of misinformation extremism that people believe led to the riots 'Haven´t we had enough time to figure out how to manage discourse without enabling violence?' one employee wrote on an internal message board at the height of the Jan. 6 turmoil. 'We´ve been fueling this fire for a long time and we shouldn´t be surprised it´s now out of control.' It´s a question that still hangs over the company today, as Congress and regulators investigate Facebook´s part in the Jan. 6 riots. It quickly became clear that even after years under the microscope for insufficiently policing its platform, the social network had missed how riot participants spent weeks vowing - on Facebook itself - to stop Congress from certifying Joe Biden´s election victory. The documents also appear to bolster Haugen´s claim that Facebook put its growth and profits ahead of public safety, opening the clearest window yet into how Facebook´s conflicting impulses - to safeguard its business and protect democracy - clashed in the days and weeks leading up to the attempted Jan. 6 coup. This story is based in part on disclosures Haugen made to the Securities and Exchange Commission and provided to Congress in redacted form by Haugen´s legal counsel. The redacted versions received by Congress were obtained by a consortium of news organizations, including The Associated Press. What Facebook called 'Break the Glass' emergency measures put in place on Jan. 6 were essentially a toolkit of options designed to stem the spread of dangerous or violent content that the social network had first used in the run-up to the bitter 2020 election. As many as 22 of those measures were rolled back at some point after the election, according to an internal spreadsheet analyzing the company's response. 'As soon as the election was over, they turned them back off or they changed the settings back to what they were before, to prioritize growth over safety,' Haugen in an interview with '60 Minutes.' A Capitol police officer was one of the five people who died as a result of the riot New internal documents provided by former Facebook employee-turned-whistleblower Frances Haugen provide a rare glimpse into how the company, after years under the microscope for the policing of its platform, appears to have simply stumbled into the Jan. 6 riot Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg has faced heavy criticism for how his platform controls information and data An internal Facebook report following Jan. 6, previously reported by BuzzFeed, faulted the company for having a 'piecemeal' approach to the rapid growth of 'Stop the Steal' pages, related misinformation sources, and violent and inciteful comments. Facebook the situation is more nuanced and that it carefully calibrates its controls to react quickly to spikes in hateful and violent content, as it did on Jan 6. The company it´s not responsible for the actions of the rioters and that having stricter controls in place prior to that day wouldn´t have helped. Facebook´s decisions to phase certain safety measures in or out took into account signals from the Facebook platform as well as information from law enforcement, spokeswoman Dani Lever. 'When those signals changed, so did the measures.' Lever some of the measures stayed in place well into February and others remain active today. Some employees were unhappy with Facebook's managing of problematic content even before the Jan. 6 riots. One employee who departed the company in 2020 left a long note charging that promising new tools, backed by strong research, were being constrained by Facebook for 'fears of public and policy stakeholder responses' (translation: concerns about negative reactions from Trump allies and investors). Videos of rioters entering the Capitol building often went viral themselves through the social media giant Facebook was founded in 2004, originally meant to be used as network of Harvard University students Research conducted by Facebook well before the 2020 campaign left little doubt that its algorithm could pose a serious danger of spreading misinformation and potentially radicalizing users 'Similarly (though even more concerning), I´ve seen already built & functioning safeguards being rolled back for the same reasons,' wrote the employee, whose name is blacked out. Research conducted by Facebook well before the 2020 campaign left little doubt that its algorithm could pose a serious danger of spreading misinformation and potentially radicalizing users. One 2019 study, entitled 'Carol´s Journey to QAnon-A Test User Study of Misinfo & Polarization Risks Encountered through Recommendation Systems,' described results of an experiment conducted with a test account established to reflect the views of a prototypical 'strong conservative' - but not extremist - 41-year North Carolina woman. This test account, using the fake name Carol Smith, indicated a preference for mainstream news sources like Fox News, followed humor groups that mocked liberals, embraced Christianity and was a fan of Melania Trump. Within a single day, page recommendations for this account generated by Facebook itself had evolved to a 'quite troubling, polarizing state,' the study found. By day 2, the algorithm was recommending more extremist content, including a QAnon-linked group, which the fake user didn´t join because she wasn't innately drawn to conspiracy theories. A week later the test subject's feed featured 'a barrage of extreme, conspiratorial and graphic content,' including posts reviving the false Obama birther lie and linking the Clintons to the murder of a former Arkansas state senator. Much of the content was pushed by dubious groups run from abroad or by administrators with a track record for violating Facebook´s rules on bot activity. Those results led the researcher, whose name was redacted by the whistleblower, to recommend safety measures running from removing content with known conspiracy references and disabling 'top contributor' badges for misinformation commenters to lowering the threshold number of followers required before Facebook verifies a page administrator´s identity. Among the other Facebook employees who read the research the response was almost universally supportive. 'Hey! This is such a thorough and well-outlined (and disturbing) study,' one user wrote, their name blacked out by the whistleblower. 'Do you know of any concrete changes that came out of this?' Facebook the study was an one of many examples of its commitment to continually studying and improving its platform. Another study turned over to congressional investigators, titled 'Understanding the Dangers of Harmful Topic Communities,' discussed how like-minded individuals embracing a borderline topic or identity can form 'echo chambers' for misinformation that normalizes harmful attitudes, spurs radicalization and can even provide a justification for violence. Examples of such harmful communities include QAnon and, hate groups promoting theories of a race war. 'The risk of offline violence or harm becomes more likely when like-minded individuals come together and support one another to act,' the study concludes. Charging documents filed by federal prosecutors against those alleged to have stormed the Capitol have examples of such like-minded people coming together. Prosecutors a reputed leader in the Oath Keepers militia group used Facebook to discuss forming an 'alliance' and coordinating plans with another extremist group, the Proud Boys, ahead of the riot at the Capitol. 'We have decided to work together and shut this s-t down,' Kelly Meggs, described by authorities as the leader of the Florida chapter of the Oath Keepers, wrote on Facebook, according to court records. Facebook needs to change its CEO, not its name: The public has lost trust in the network and the only way to regain it is for Zuckerberg to stand down, professor of communications A former spokesperson for President Barack Obama's Treasury Department is calling for Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg to resign after more revelations have been made public about the company's failure to stop disinformation. Kara Alaimo, now serving as an associate professor in the Lawrence Herbert School of Communication at Hofstra University, claims that Zuckerberg 'has done little to try to fix' the problems with the social media behemoth. A new whistleblower affidavit submitted by a former Facebook employee accuses the social media giant of prioritizing profits over their due diligence to combat hate speech, misinformation and other threats to the public. The new allegations, submitted anonymously under penalty of perjury, echoed the claims made by fellow whistleblower Frances Haugen, who delivered a scathing testimony before Congress this month on Facebook's moral failings. Kara Alaimo, now serving as an associate professor in the Lawrence Herbert School of Communication at Hofstra University, that the first step to fixing problems at Facebook would be for CEO Mark Zuckerberg to resign Zuckerberg, who founded Facebook, has a net worth is $122 billion, making him the 5th-richest person in the world In the most dramatic line of the affidavit, the former employee anguished over Facebook's inability to act quickly to help curb racial killings in Myanmar in 2017 as military officials used the site to spread hate speech. The op-ed comes as Facebook considers changing the company's name after all the bad publicity. The company is also hinting at plans for a so-called 'metaverse' - a virtual reality version of the internet where people can game, work and communicate. The tech giant's CEO Mark Zuckerberg has been a leading voice on the concept, which would blur the lines between the physical world and the digital one. It could allow someone to don a virtual reality headset to make them feel as if they're face-to-face with a friend, despite being thousands of miles apart and connected via the internet. Whistleblower Frances Haugen delivered a scathing testimony before Congress earlier this month on Facebook's moral failings. Alaimo the company needs much more than a cosmetic change. 'The place to start is with Zuckerberg's resignation,' she wrote in the op-ed. Zuckerberg, Alaimo , either can't fix Facebook's issues or won't. 'It's clear that he lacks the moral inclination or the capacity to solve these problems,' she wrote. 'Either way, he's got to go. The company should announce a new chief executive with all possible haste. It should be someone thoughtful and committed to transparency about how social media is harming our society -- who has the will and competence to put the platform on a very different course.' Simply put, Alaimo argues Zuckerberg's company, which has nearly three billion users, has lost the public trust. 'It's because the public has lost faith in Facebook. And rightly so. For all the family photos shared or funny videos consumed that the company has made possible, 'Facebook' is now also a name associated in recent years with misinformation, privacy violations, the spread of hate and autocracy.' Alaimo calls Facebook's reputation 'bankrupt' and the name will do little to restore public trust. Haugen has that Facebook holds culpability for the January 6 Capitol insurrection The company it more or less 'stumbled' onto the riot, which resulted in the deaths of five people As the world begins to truly contend with just how dangerous social media platforms can be, Facebook's reckoning has been kicked into overdrive following former staffer Frances Haugen's shocking allegations that the company has long known about its platform's toxic effects on society -- and has done little to try to fix them. 'The only way for Facebook to restore that trust is to change its leadership and address the actual issues that have justifiably prompted so much concern.' This is the first time the company has faced such accusations since the internal memos released and testimony given by Haugen. Haugen and the new whistleblower also submitted the allegations to the Securities and Exchange Commission, which oversees all publicly traded companies. In the SEC affidavit, the anonymous ex-employee alleges that Facebook officials routinely undermined efforts within the company to fight misinformation and hate speech out of fear of angering then-President Donald Trump and his allies. The former employee that on one occasion, Facebook's Public Policy team defended a 'white list' that exempted the alt-right media company Breitbart News and other Trump-aligned publishers from Facebook's ordinary rules against spreading fake news. Alaimo 'he company should announce a new chief executive with all possible haste' Facebook is blamed by Haugen as knowing Instagram harmed young girls' body image and even tried to brainstorm ways to appeal to toddlers by 'exploring playdates as a growth lever.' Ultimately, Alaimo argues, 'changing a name won't change reality.' The complaints come after Haugen's testimony before Congress in early October, where she claimed Facebook promoted divisiveness as a way to keep people on the site, with Haugen saying the documents showed the company had failed to protect young users. It also showed that the company knew Instagram harmed young girls' body image and even tried to brainstorm ways to appeal to toddlers by 'exploring playdates as a growth lever.' 'The company's leadership knows how to make Facebook and Instagram safer, but won't make the necessary changes because they have put their astronomical profits before people. Congressional action is needed,' Haugen at a hearing. Haugen, who anonymously filed eight complaints about her former employer with the US Securities and Exchange Commission, told 60 Minutes earlier this month: 'Facebook, over and over again, has shown it chooses profit over safety.' She claimed that a 2018 change prioritizing divisive posts, which made Facebook users argue, was found to boost user engagement. That in turn helped bosses sell more online ads that have seen the social media giant's value pass $1 trillion. 'You are forcing us to take positions that we don't like, that we know are bad for society. We know if we don't take those positions, we won't win in the marketplace of social media,' Haugen . She also blamed Facebook for spurring the January 6 Capitol riot."", ""A former spokesperson for President Barack Obama's Treasury Department is calling for Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg to resign after more revelations have been made public about the company's failure to stop disinformation.

Ultimately, Alaimo argues, 'changing a name won't change reality.' The complaints come after Haugen's testimony before Congress in early October, where she claimed Facebook promoted divisiveness as a way to keep people on the site, with Haugen saying the documents showed the company had failed to protect young users. It also showed that the company knew Instagram harmed young girls' body image and even tried to brainstorm ways to appeal to toddlers by 'exploring playdates as a growth lever.' 'The company's leadership knows how to make Facebook and Instagram safer, but won't make the necessary changes because they have put their astronomical profits before people. Congressional action is needed,' Haugen at a hearing. Haugen, who anonymously filed eight complaints about her former employer with the US Securities and Exchange Commission, told 60 Minutes earlier this month: 'Facebook, over and over again, has shown it chooses profit over safety.' She claimed that a 2018 change prioritizing divisive posts, which made Facebook users argue, was found to boost user engagement. That in turn helped bosses sell more online ads that have seen the social media giant's value pass $1 trillion. 'You are forcing us to take positions that we don't like, that we know are bad for society. We know if we don't take those positions, we won't win in the marketplace of social media,' Haugen . She also blamed Facebook for spurring the January 6 Capitol riot. 'We've been fueling this fire for a long time': Facebook employees raged as they scrambled to delete posts that incited violence on Jan 6 - but the firm didn't allow them to target some groups calling for violence Whistleblowers at social media giant Facebook are saying the company didn't do enough to stop the spread of misinformation in the days and weeks leading up to, as well as during, the Capitol riot on January 6. New internal documents provided by former Facebook employee-turned-whistleblower Frances Haugen provide a rare glimpse into how the company appears to have simply stumbled into the Jan. 6 riot. Reports that in California, Facebook engineers were racing to tweak internal controls to slow the spread of misinformation and inciteful content. Emergency actions - some of which were rolled back after the 2020 election - included banning Trump, freezing comments in groups with a record for hate speech, filtering out the 'Stop the Steal' rallying cry and empowering content moderators to act more assertively by labeling the U.S. a 'Temporary High Risk Location' for political violence. At the same time, frustration inside Facebook erupted over what some saw as the company's halting and often reversed response to rising extremism in the U.S. Former Facebook employee Frances Haugen (pictured above) has provided new details on the company's response to the Capitol riot Five people died in the insurrection, which attempted to stop American electors from certifying the 2020 Presidential Election for Joe Biden Within Facebook, there were complaints that the company hadn't done enough to stop the spread of misinformation extremism that people believe led to the riots 'Haven´t we had enough time to figure out how to manage discourse without enabling violence?' one employee wrote on an internal message board at the height of the Jan. 6 turmoil. 'We´ve been fueling this fire for a long time and we shouldn´t be surprised it´s now out of control.' It´s a question that still hangs over the company today, as Congress and regulators investigate Facebook´s part in the Jan. 6 riots. It quickly became clear that even after years under the microscope for insufficiently policing its platform, the social network had missed how riot participants spent weeks vowing - on Facebook itself - to stop Congress from certifying Joe Biden´s election victory. The documents also appear to bolster Haugen´s claim that Facebook put its growth and profits ahead of public safety, opening the clearest window yet into how Facebook´s conflicting impulses - to safeguard its business and protect democracy - clashed in the days and weeks leading up to the attempted Jan. 6 coup. This story is based in part on disclosures Haugen made to the Securities and Exchange Commission and provided to Congress in redacted form by Haugen´s legal counsel. The redacted versions received by Congress were obtained by a consortium of news organizations, including The Associated Press. What Facebook called 'Break the Glass' emergency measures put in place on Jan. 6 were essentially a toolkit of options designed to stem the spread of dangerous or violent content that the social network had first used in the run-up to the bitter 2020 election. As many as 22 of those measures were rolled back at some point after the election, according to an internal spreadsheet analyzing the company's response. 'As soon as the election was over, they turned them back off or they changed the settings back to what they were before, to prioritize growth over safety,' Haugen in an interview with '60 Minutes.' A Capitol police officer was one of the five people who died as a result of the riot New internal documents provided by former Facebook employee-turned-whistleblower Frances Haugen provide a rare glimpse into how the company, after years under the microscope for the policing of its platform, appears to have simply stumbled into the Jan. 6 riot Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg has faced heavy criticism for how his platform controls information and data An internal Facebook report following Jan. 6, previously reported by BuzzFeed, faulted the company for having a 'piecemeal' approach to the rapid growth of 'Stop the Steal' pages, related misinformation sources, and violent and inciteful comments. Facebook the situation is more nuanced and that it carefully calibrates its controls to react quickly to spikes in hateful and violent content, as it did on Jan 6. The company it´s not responsible for the actions of the rioters and that having stricter controls in place prior to that day wouldn´t have helped. Facebook´s decisions to phase certain safety measures in or out took into account signals from the Facebook platform as well as information from law enforcement, spokeswoman Dani Lever. 'When those signals changed, so did the measures.' Lever some of the measures stayed in place well into February and others remain active today. Some employees were unhappy with Facebook's managing of problematic content even before the Jan. 6 riots. One employee who departed the company in 2020 left a long note charging that promising new tools, backed by strong research, were being constrained by Facebook for 'fears of public and policy stakeholder responses' (translation: concerns about negative reactions from Trump allies and investors). Videos of rioters entering the Capitol building often went viral themselves through the social media giant Facebook was founded in 2004, originally meant to be used as network of Harvard University students Research conducted by Facebook well before the 2020 campaign left little doubt that its algorithm could pose a serious danger of spreading misinformation and potentially radicalizing users 'Similarly (though even more concerning), I´ve seen already built & functioning safeguards being rolled back for the same reasons,' wrote the employee, whose name is blacked out. Research conducted by Facebook well before the 2020 campaign left little doubt that its algorithm could pose a serious danger of spreading misinformation and potentially radicalizing users. One 2019 study, entitled 'Carol´s Journey to QAnon-A Test User Study of Misinfo & Polarization Risks Encountered through Recommendation Systems,' described results of an experiment conducted with a test account established to reflect the views of a prototypical 'strong conservative' - but not extremist - 41-year North Carolina woman. This test account, using the fake name Carol Smith, indicated a preference for mainstream news sources like Fox News, followed humor groups that mocked liberals, embraced Christianity and was a fan of Melania Trump. Within a single day, page recommendations for this account generated by Facebook itself had evolved to a 'quite troubling, polarizing state,' the study found. By day 2, the algorithm was recommending more extremist content, including a QAnon-linked group, which the fake user didn´t join because she wasn't innately drawn to conspiracy theories. A week later the test subject's feed featured 'a barrage of extreme, conspiratorial and graphic content,' including posts reviving the false Obama birther lie and linking the Clintons to the murder of a former Arkansas state senator. Much of the content was pushed by dubious groups run from abroad or by administrators with a track record for violating Facebook´s rules on bot activity. Those results led the researcher, whose name was redacted by the whistleblower, to recommend safety measures running from removing content with known conspiracy references and disabling 'top contributor' badges for misinformation commenters to lowering the threshold number of followers required before Facebook verifies a page administrator´s identity. Among the other Facebook employees who read the research the response was almost universally supportive. 'Hey! This is such a thorough and well-outlined (and disturbing) study,' one user wrote, their name blacked out by the whistleblower. 'Do you know of any concrete changes that came out of this?' Facebook the study was an one of many examples of its commitment to continually studying and improving its platform. Another study turned over to congressional investigators, titled 'Understanding the Dangers of Harmful Topic Communities,' discussed how like-minded individuals embracing a borderline topic or identity can form 'echo chambers' for misinformation that normalizes harmful attitudes, spurs radicalization and can even provide a justification for violence. Examples of such harmful communities include QAnon and, hate groups promoting theories of a race war. 'The risk of offline violence or harm becomes more likely when like-minded individuals come together and support one another to act,' the study concludes. Charging documents filed by federal prosecutors against those alleged to have stormed the Capitol have examples of such like-minded people coming together. Prosecutors a reputed leader in the Oath Keepers militia group used Facebook to discuss forming an 'alliance' and coordinating plans with another extremist group, the Proud Boys, ahead of the riot at the Capitol. 'We have decided to work together and shut this s-t down,' Kelly Meggs, described by authorities as the leader of the Florida chapter of the Oath Keepers, wrote on Facebook, according to court records.""]"

The raucous uprising was enough to force the resignation of Sri Lanka's President and Prime Minister, as months of frustration brought on by an unprecedented economic crisis boiled over. As well as holding an impromptu pool party, the protestors enjoyed a sing-along on the president's grand piano, a pillow fight in the prime minister's bedrooms, and even made time for a spot of weight-lifting in the president's private gym. But the light-hearted high jinx gave way to more ominous anger as a fire was started in the prime minister's private home Temple Trees that burned into the night. The prime minister was not present at the time. Today the protesters are refusing to budge from President Gotabaya Rajapaksa's residence, a day after they stormed his home, forcing him to flee on a navy ship and announce he would resign. 'Our struggle is not over,' student leader Lahiru Weerasekara told reporters the day after Rajapaksa, currently taking refuge on a vessel offshore, he would step down on Wednesday. 'We won't give up this struggle until he actually leaves.' The prime minister, Ranil Wickremesinghe, he will leave office once an all-party interim government is in place, hours before the speaker of the Sri Lankan parliament President Gotabaya Rajapaksa would also step down on Wednesday July 13. Calm had returned to Colombo by the following morning, as Sri Lankans roamed through the ransacked presidential palace a day after protesters had stormed the building. Hundreds of thousands of people had massed in the capital Colombo on Saturday to demand the government take responsibility for mismanaging the nation's finances, and for crippling food and fuel shortages.

The International Monetary Fund (IMF), which has been in talks with the Sri Lankan government for a possible $3 billion bailout, on Sunday it was monitoring events closely. 'We hope for a resolution of the current situation that will allow for resumption of our dialogue on an IMF-supported programme,' the global lender in a statement. The political chaos could complicate efforts to pull Sri Lanka out of its worst economic crisis in seven decades, triggered by a severe shortage of foreign currency that has stalled the imports of essentials like fuel, food and medicines. Police had attempted to thwart promised protests with a curfew, then lifted it as lawyers and opposition politicians denounced it as illegal. After storming the gates of the presidential palace, a throng of protesters walked through its rooms, with some among the boisterous crowd jumping into the compound's pool. Others were seen laughing and lounging in the stately bedrooms of the residence, with one pulling out what he claimed was a pair of Rajapaksa's underwear. On Sunday, amazed ordinary folk took the opportunity to inspect the colonial-era building. Members of the security forces, some with assault rifles, stood outside the compound but did not stop people going in. Among those taking a look was 61-year-old handkerchief seller B.M. Chandrawathi, who sauntered into a first-floor bedroom accompanied by her daughter and grandchildren. 'I've never seen a place like this in my life,' Chandrawathi as she tried out a plush sofa. 'They enjoyed super luxury while we suffered,' she . 'We were hoodwinked. I wanted my kids and grandkids to see the luxurious lifestyles they were enjoying.'

'To ensure a peaceful transition, the president he will step down on July 13,' parliamentary speaker Mahinda Abeywardana in a televised statement. Mr Rajapaksa will remain temporarily to ensure a smooth transfer of power, Mr Abeywardena added. 'There is no need for further disturbances in the country, and I urge everyone for the sake of the country to maintain peace to enable a smooth transition,' the speaker continued. Opposition legislator Rauff Hakeem a consensus was reached for the speaker of Parliament to take over as temporary president and work on an interim government. Wickremesinghe announced his own impending resignation but he would not step down until a new government is formed, angering protesters who demanded his immediate departure. 'Today in this country we have a fuel crisis, a food shortage, we have the head of the World Food Program coming here and we have several matters to discuss with the IMF,' Wickremesinghe . 'Therefore, if this government leaves there should be another government.' Wickremesinghe he suggested to the president to have an all-party government, and called a meeting with political leaders where he he was willing to step down to pave the way for a unity government. But this failed to placate protesters, who stormed the premier's private residence and set it alight after night fell. Footage shared on social media showed a crowd cheering the blaze, which broke out shortly after a security detachment guarding Wickremesinghe attacked several journalists outside the home.

But people's patience wore thin as shortages of fuel, medicine and cooking gas only increased and oil reserves ran dry.

The fury that Sri Lankans feel towards President Gotabaya Rajapaksa runs deep. Rolling blackouts cut electricity to power fans and air-conditioners, essential items double in price each month, and petrol to fuel tuk-tuks and motorbikes is hard to come by. Sri Lankans must now dedicate enormous quantities of their time to queueing. Queueing for food, queueing for gas, queueing for water. This is on top of their usual working weeks, to earn rupees that are worth less and less. In poorer neighbourhoods, people have taken to banding together and cooking in the street - with the food they can afford and the food they can find. Malnourishment is now a problem in South Asia's most developed country. These problems, long-running and ongoing as they are, are put squarely at the door of President Gotabaya Rajapaksa and his family, who have run the country like their own personal business for over a decade. Between Gotabaya and his brother, Mahinda, who was prime minister until he was forced out by violent riots in May, and the other brothers and family members they appointed to governmental posts, they have been accused of a myriad of corruption offences. Ranging from dodgy deals with Chinese state companies to diverting tsunami relief funds and dipping into public coffers to make personal purchases of land, the alleged mismanagement has been egregious. The present prime minister, Ranil Wickremesinghe, revealed that Sri Lanka has less than $1 million in foreign reserves, dwindling medical supplies and almost no fuel.

He a consensus was reached that the parliamentary speaker should take over as temporary president and work on an interim government. Sri Lanka's economy is in a state of collapse, relying on aid from India and other countries as its leaders try to negotiate a bailout with the International Monetary Fund. The economic meltdown has led to severe shortages of essential items, leaving people struggling to buy food, fuel and other necessities. The turmoil has led to months of protests, which have nearly dismantled the Rajapaksa political dynasty that has ruled Sri Lanka for most of the past two decades. With fuel supplies scarce, many protesters crowded onto buses and trains to come to the city to protest, while others made their way on bicycles and on foot. Protest and religious leaders called on Rajapaksa to step down, saying he has lost the people's mandate. 'His claim that he was voted in by the Sinhala Buddhists is not valid now,' Ven. Omalpe Sobitha, a prominent Buddhist leader. He urged Parliament to convene immediately to select an interim president but that Wickremesinghe did not enjoy the people's support. Protest leaders in their proclamation demanded the resignation of not only the president and the government but all government officials and the country's ambassadors. They that the protesters should have access to governance as a pressure group. Sri Lanka's Prime Minister, Ranil Wickremesinghe, has summoned an emergency meeting of political party leaders today in response. Last month, Wickremesinghe the country's economy had collapsed. He that the negotiations with the IMF have been complex because Sri Lanka was now a bankrupt state. The economic meltdown has led to severe shortages of essential items, leaving people struggling to buy food, fuel and other necessities. The turmoil has led to months of protests, which have nearly dismantled the Rajapaksa political dynasty that has ruled Sri Lanka for most of the past two decades.

Despite a severe shortage of fuel that has stalled transportation services, demonstrators packed into buses, trains and trucks from several parts of the country to reach Colombo to protest the government's failure to protect them from economic ruin. Discontent has worsened in recent weeks as the cash-strapped country stopped receiving fuel shipments, forcing school closures and rationing of petrol and diesel for essential services. Sampath Perera, a 37-year-old fisherman took an overcrowded bus from the seaside town of Negombo 45 km (30 miles) north of Colombo, to join the protest. 'We have told Gota over and over again to go home but he is still clinging onto power. We will not stop until he listens to us,' Perera . He is among the millions squeezed by chronic fuel shortages and inflation that hit 54.6% in June.
