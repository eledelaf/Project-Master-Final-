https://www.dailymail.co.uk/debate/article-9136627/STEPHEN-GLOVER-Twitter-bans-Donald-Trump-voice-terrorists.html,1,"For more than a decade President Donald Trump has been disseminating lies and abuse on Twitter.

He claimed in 2012 that the Chinese ‘created the concept of global warming’. He asserted in 2017 that in the previous year’s presidential election he had won more votes than Hillary Clinton, though he actually received three million fewer.

Trump has consistently fabricated untruths about his predecessor, Barack Obama, stoking the falsehood that the first African-American President was born abroad, and accusing him of having wire-tapped Trump Tower during the 2016 campaign.

For years, as these fantasies spewed out, Twitter was happy to provide a platform for Trump.

Controversial, divisive, rude, inaccurate — he was the perfect ambassador for a social networking service that thrives on sensation and confrontation, and loves nothing more than stirring up a good old spat.

Outrage

And now, in the dying days of his presidency, Twitter has assumed the unaccustomed mantle of virtue and banned Trump for life, ‘due to the risk of further incitement to violence’.

So it is that an organisation which promotes intellectual hooliganism, and is probably more responsible than any other for the cheapening and degradation of public discourse, has ejected the hoodlum-in-chief.

Why? Why has it turned on the man who epitomised its values — or absence of them? Why is the President who succoured and fostered the media site suddenly surplus to requirements?

Partly because after Trump whipped up the mob before it marched on the Capitol last week, Twitter executives thought it no longer prudent to offer him a home. Rather in the way a Mafia boss knows where to draw a line, they decided their erstwhile champion should be sent packing.

In the dying days of his presidency, Twitter has assumed the unaccustomed mantle of virtue and banned Trump for life, ‘due to the risk of further incitement to violence’

And partly because with an incoming Democratic administration that will have a majority in the House and probably the Senate, Twitter hopes it can stave off disobliging legislation by demonising a President detested by the Democrats. Best be on the right side of power.

This question nonetheless remains: However ghastly and disruptive Trump undoubtedly is, is it morally right for the social media site to single him out for defenestration (along with hundreds of his supporters)?

After all, as Trump’s son Donald Junior pointed out yesterday, Twitter still offers a perch to Hassan Rouhani, President of the Islamic Republic of Iran. He is no sweetie. If given the choice of crossing the Sahara with either Rouhani or Trump, in the possession of a single water bottle, I might choose Trump.

Twitter may have improved its record since the Commons Home Affairs Select Committee declared in 2016 that social media networks had become the ‘vehicle of choice in spreading propaganda and the recruiting platforms for terrorism’.

But although it has expelled hundreds of thousands of accounts over the years because of their terrorism content, it is a reasonable assumption that no sooner does it get rid of one terrorist than another pops up under a different guise.

This question nonetheless remains: However ghastly and disruptive Trump undoubtedly is, is it morally right for the social media site to single him out for defenestration (along with hundreds of his supporters)?

The fact is that it has provided, and still provides, an arena for many bad people. It allowed the terrorist group Lashkar-e-Taiba, which carried out the 2008 Mumbai massacre, to operate an account. During the Westgate terrorist outrage in Kenya in 2013, al-Shabaab used Twitter to claim responsibility, and tweeted live throughout the attack.

Twitter has kept Louis Farrakhan, the controversial leader of the Nation of Islam, on its books. He has made various highly provocative remarks interpreted as anti-white, and in particular as anti-Semitic.

Farrakhan once described Adolf Hitler as a ‘very great man’ and a ‘great German’. Perhaps not very surprisingly, he has praised Donald Trump on several occasions, once saying he ‘liked what I’m looking at’.

Twitter still offers a perch to Hassan Rouhani, President of the Islamic Republic of Iran. He is no sweetie. If given the choice of crossing the Sahara with either Rouhani or Trump, in the possession of a single water bottle, I might choose Trump

Isn’t this all very odd? Whereas Hassan Rouhani, Louis Farrakhan, and legions of rogues are considered acceptable to Twitter, the elected President of the United States is suddenly persona non grata.

True, last Wednesday he recklessly called the people who stormed the Capitol ‘patriots’, and was locked out of his account for 12 hours by Twitter. But the supposedly toxic two tweets which led to his expulsion don’t seem very incendiary.

In the first he raved about how ‘the 75,000,000 great American Patriots who voted for me . . . will have a GIANT VOICE long into the future’. In the second he merely said that he would not be ‘going to the inauguration on January 20’.

Excessive

According to Twitter, the first tweet was construed ‘as further indication that President Trump does not plan to facilitate an orderly transition’ while the second provided ‘further confirmation of [Trump’s view] that the election was not legitimate’.

Pushing it a bit? I’d say so. The interpretation of the second tweet is especially tendentious. If Trump doesn’t want to turn up for Joe Biden’s inauguration, that is proof he has bad manners and is a poor loser.

Not necessarily that the election was in his view ‘illegitimate’, though he has said as much on other occasions.

Twitter has kept Louis Farrakhan, the controversial leader of the Nation of Islam, on its books. He has made various highly provocative remarks interpreted as anti-white, and in particular as anti-Semitic

The truth is that Twitter was looking for an excuse to get rid of him and, when it came to it, the offence did not justify his treatment. A life ban is excessive. It could have suspended him again, as Facebook has done, but that did not suit the social media site’s purpose.

What all this shows, as Health Secretary Matt Hancock suggested in a television interview on Sunday, is that Twitter is not a social media platform, as it likes to pretend, but a publisher which increasingly makes its own political judgments about what to include and exclude.

No one would suggest that an online newspaper is under any obligation to provide space for the American President or anyone else. It is also perfectly within its rights to moderate the comments of readers so that they conform to its standards of decency and fairness.

Obnoxious

Twitter is different inasmuch as it has generally much looser standards, and claims not to be a publisher selecting pieces, but a platform on which 300 million people can roost and write more or less what they want.

Except for Donald Trump, and others of his political stamp with whom Twitter disagrees. And if Trump is censored — in fact, banned — who comes next? However obnoxious he may be, he is still an elected President, and speaks for many millions.

If he broke the law in fomenting a riot — as has been widely alleged — that is a matter for the law, and upholders of the American constitution. It is not for Twitter to determine what can be written.

The truth is that Twitter was looking for an excuse to get rid of him and, when it came to it, the offence did not justify his treatment. A life ban is excessive. It could have suspended him again, as Facebook has done, but that did not suit the social media site’s purpose. Pictured: Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey

The suspicion inevitably grows that it and the other social media companies are in fact publishers with a hidden Left-leaning agenda which they disavow. They deplore fascist tendencies in Trump, who was once commercially useful to them, while in suppressing free speech show how illiberal they really are.

How much better it would be for society if social media didn’t exist! They have made politics nastier and more confrontational. They facilitate the spreading of lies and misinformation which are lapped up by gullible people.

But, alas, Twitter and the rest are here to stay. And if they insist on behaving like publishers they’ll have to take responsibility for the myriad falsehoods they churn out. Then they can decide whether or not to publish Donald Trump.","STEPHEN GLOVER: If Twitter bans Donald Trump, how can it give a voice to terrorists?",1

House Speaker Kevin McCarthy has handed 40,000 hours of January 6 footage to Carlson, who has been reviewing it and airing his findings for his millions-strong audience.

He has repeatedly claimed that President Joe Biden and his administration are 'lying' to the American people about what happened that day.

On Monday evening, Carlson showed his viewers footage that showed a much calmer version of January 6 unfolding and said: 'The footage does not show an insurrection or a riot in progress.'

'The video record does not support the claim that January 6 was an insurrection. In fact, it demolishes that claim. And that's exactly why the Democratic Party and its allies in the media prevented you from seeing it.'

In response, Sicknick's family released a condemnatory statement making it clear that they are 'outraged at the ongoing attack on our family by the unscrupulous and outright sleazy so-called 'news' network of Fox News who will do the bidding of Trump or any of his sycophant followers, no matter what damage is done to the families of the fallen.'

This undated image provided by the United States Capitol Police shows U.S. Capitol Police Officer Brian Sicknick, who died Thursday, Jan. 7, 2021. In April 2021, the DC medical examiner ruled that Sicknick, who was injured while confronting rioters, suffered a stroke and died from natural causes

It was originally suggested Sicknick's death came as the result of being attacked with a fire extinguisher and pepper spray by rioters.

But a medical examiner later ruled he'd died of natural causes. And Carlson shared footage of Sicknick walking around the Capitol after the attack.

He appeared in good health, which the Fox News host said poured cold water on liberal outlets' insistence that the Capitol rioters had Sicknick's blood on their hands.

In April 2021, the DC medical examiner ruled that Sicknick, who was injured while confronting rioters, suffered a stroke and died from natural causes.

'To this day, media accounts describe Sicknick as someone who was, quote, 'slain' on January 6,' Carlson said on Monday night.

'The video we reviewed proves that is a lie.'

Carlson said the officer was 'healthy and vigorous,' and noted he was wearing a helmet.

'So it's hard to imagine he was killed by a head injury,' he said.

'Whatever happened to Brian Sicknick was very obviously not the result of violence he suffered at the entrance to the Capitol.

'This tape overturns the single most powerful and politically useful lie the Democrats have told us about January 6.'

In response, Sicknick's family released a condemnatory statement making it clear that they are 'outraged at the ongoing attack on our family by the unscrupulous and outright sleazy so-called 'news' network of Fox News who will do the bidding of Trump or any of his sycophant followers, no matter what damage is done to the families of the fallen.'

In response, the family wrote: 'Carlson's 'truth' is to pick and choose footage that supports his delusional views that the Jan 6th insurrection was peaceful and that Ashley Babbit was some kind of martyr.

'Whilst making a criminal out to be a martyr, he is also downplaying the horrid situation faced by the USCP (United States Capitol Police) and DC Metro Police who were incredibly outnumbered and were literally fighting for their very lives,' the statement continued.

Ashley Babbit was a 36-year-old Air Force veteran Trump supporter who was shot dead by a police officer on January 6 inside the Capitol Hill complex. An internal Capitol Police inquiry ultimately found the shooting to be lawful.

'The Sicknick Family would love nothing more than to have Brian back with us and to resume our normal lives. Fictitious news outlets like Fox and its rabid followers will not allow that.

'Every time the pain of that day seems to have ebbed a bit, organizations like Fox rip our wounds wide open again and we are frankly sick of it,' the family concluded.

Former President Donald Trump previously praised Speaker McCarthy for releasing the footage to Carlson and his producers.

'The New Surveillance Footage of the January 6th Events sheds an entirely different light on what actually happened. The Unselect Committee was a giant SCAM, and has now unequivocally been stamped as CRIMINAL FABRICATORS OF THIS MOST IMPORTANT DAY,' wrote Trump on Truth Social.

On Monday night, Carlson unveiled the new footage, which also showed so-called QAnon Shaman Jacob Chansley apparently being escorted into the Senate by Capitol police officers.

Carlson suggestion challenged the prevailing narrative that Chansley - jailed for four years over the incident - aggressively barged into the chamber.

He also referenced Ray Epps, who was seen among the rioters urging them to storm the Capitol yet was never charged - giving rise to suspicion that Epps was in fact an informant. Epps has denied working for the government.

On Monday, Carlson suggested Epps was lying.

'They were orderly and meek,' said Carlson of those who stormed the Capitol. 'These were not insurrectionists; they were sightseers.'

Carlson said they 'obviously revere the Capitol', noting they took selfies and 'queue up in neat little lines'.

'Deadly insurrection. Everything about that phrase is a lie,' he said.

'Very little about January 6 was organized or violent.

'Surveillance video from inside the Capitol shows mostly peaceful chaos.'

Carlson pointed to footage showing the 'QAnon Shaman' - a bare-chested, Viking helmet-wearing Jacob Chansley - inside the Capitol.

Chansley, a 33-year-old naval veteran from Arizona, was one of the most high-profile figures to enter the Capitol on January 6.

He has been sentenced to almost four years for 'obstructing an official proceeding.'

In the footage, Chansley appears to be guided by an official as he wanders the Capitol.

He passes a line of riot police, who make no move to stop him.

Then they escort him to various entrances of the chamber which appear to be locked, and eventually find him an open door through which he vanishes.

'Virtually every moment of his time inside the Capitol was caught on tape,' said Carlson.

'The tapes show the Capitol police never stopped Jacob Chansley. They helped him. They acted as his tour guides.'",Family of Capitol cop Brian Sicknick issue blistering statement after release of new Jan. 6 footage,1

The veteran foreign policy hawk, who was branded Mr Tough Guy by Trump, said his White House campaign will focus on being tougher on China and Russia.

The 74-year-old already has his Republican ticket rival in his sights, saying support for his MAGA policies is in 'terminal decline'.

Speaking to Good Morning Britain today, Bolton said: 'I would get in to win the nomination and I would do it primarily on the basis that we need a much stronger foreign policy.

Donald Trump's ex-national security adviser John Bolton has revealed he will stand against his former boss in the 2024 election

'I think it's important that it's understood not just in Moscow, but it's understood in places like Beijing, that unprovoked aggression against your neighbors is not something the United States and its allies will tolerate.'

Bolton has been a fixture of Republican administrations for decades, serving as Ronald Reagan's assistant attorney general, assistant secretary of state for international organization affairs under George H. W. Bush, and multiple roles under George W. Bush.

He served as under secretary of state for arms control and international security affairs from 2001 to 2005, then was appointed US ambassador to the UN, while also campaigning for the Iraq War as director of the Project for the New American Century.

Under Trump, he served from April 2018 to September 2019 as national security adviser, two years after he was overlooked as a potential secretary of state because the GOP president 'didn't like his moustache', insiders said.

Under Trump, he served from April 2018 to September 2019 as national security adviser

The pair later clashed over foreign policy views on Iran and Afghanistan, and Trump tweeted on September 9 that his 'services are no longer needed' due to their 'many' disagreements.

Bolton refuted this version of events, saying he offered to resign.

So far, Trump is the only Republican to announce their candidacy for the 2024 election, while the favored Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis is widely expected to run.

Speaking to Good Morning Britain today, Bolton said: 'I think Trump's support within the party itself is in terminal decline.

'I wouldn't run as a vanity candidate. If I didn't think I could run seriously then I wouldn't get in the race.'

He was then asked about the UK political turmoil of 2022, a year which saw three prime ministers after Liz Truss's infamous 44 days of chaos in Downing Street.

Bolton sympathized with the ex-leader over her pro-growth and low-tax budget which sparked financial pandemonium, saying: 'I think it was very, very sad, very, very unfortunate for the United Kingdom.

'The policy she and her Chancellor of the Exchequer were recommending seemed to me to be perfectly sensible.'

After his acrimonious White House exit in 2019, Bolton wrote a best-selling book about his tenure, The Room Where It Happened.

It featured bombshell claims that Trump saw 'obstruction of justice as a way of life' and withdrew criminal probes as 'personal favors' to certain dictators he liked.

Last month, Bolton teased a White House bid and lashed out at Trump over his attack on the Constitution.

He said he would have to join the 2024 presidential race if other Republicans did not step up and condemn the former president for trying to get rid of the Constitution to ensure no 'election fraud' reoccurs, despite no evidence the 2020 vote was 'stolen'.

He told NBC's Kristen Welker on Meet the Press Now: 'I think to be a presidential candidate, you can't simply say I support the Constitution you have to say I would oppose people who would undercut it.

'I'd like to see Shermanesque statements from all the potential candidates. If I don't see that then I'm going to seriously consider getting in.'

Former President Donald Trump announced on November 15 from Mar-a-Lago that he was seeking the presidency again. On Saturday, he suggested the Constitution should be gotten rid of as he continued to complain about his 2020 election loss

Bolton said: 'I think the voters, the Republican voters, people who choose the Republican nominee, nearly 95 percent disagree that Donald Trump is more important than the Constitution.

'What does a candidate have to lose by appealing to 95 percent of the base of the Republican Party?' he argued.

He encouraged GOP leaders to speak out.

'I actually think most Republican elected officials in Washington disagree with Trump on this, but they're intimidated,' he said. 'This is the time where there's strength in numbers. The more people who tell the truth, the easier it is for everybody else.'

Last year, Bolton made the astonishing admission that he had helped stage coups in other countries.

The Republican made the astonishing admission in an interview with CNN's Jake Tapper as he denied claims that the January 6 riot was an attempted coup-d'etat.

'It's not an attack on our democracy,' Bolton said of the Capitol riot. 'It's Donald Trump looking after Donald Trump. It's a once in a lifetime occurrence.'

But Tapper countered his claims, noting: 'One does not have to be brilliant to plan a coup.'

'I disagree with that as someone who helped plan coups d'etat, not here, but in other places, it takes a lot of work,' Bolton responded in the episode of The Lead. 'And that's not what he did.'",John Bolton announces he WILL run for the White House in 2024 against former boss Donald Trump,1
https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jan/08/ted-cruz-capitol-attack-tucker-carlson-interview,1,"Ted Cruz used Twitter on Friday to accuse Joe Biden of signaling “weakness and surrender to Putin” over Ukraine – but the Texas senator could not escape a crisis of his own, stoked by widespread accusations of weakness and surrender in the face of the Fox News host Tucker Carlson, over remarks about the deadly Capitol attack.

On Wednesday, a day before the first anniversary of the attack by supporters of Donald Trump attempting to overturn the election, Cruz described “a violent terrorist attack on the Capitol, where we saw the men and women of law enforcement demonstrate incredible courage”.

A police officer who confronted the rioters was one of five people who died.

Nonetheless, having stoked opprobrium in circles where the riot is played down or denied, Cruz went on Carlson’s primetime show.

Carlson, widely condemned for promoting conspiracy theories about 6 January, is rumoured to have presidential ambitions in competition with Cruz. He went fiercely on the offensive.

“You called this a ‘terror attack’ when by no definition was it a terror attack,” Carlson said. “That’s a lie. You told that lie on purpose, and I’m wondering why you did.”

Cruz said: “The way I phrased things yesterday, it was sloppy and it was, frankly, dumb.”

Carlson said: “I don’t buy that. Whoa, whoa, whoa. I don’t buy that … I do not believe that you used that accidentally. I just don’t.”

For Cruz, the interview got worse from there. The commentariat duly piled on.

From the left, Jim Newell, at Slate, said Cruz had been “groveling for forgiveness” but “all Carlson would do was insist he beg harder.

“This was Ted Cruz in maximal damage-control mode. He would only undergo this sort of debasement if he felt he’d made a mistake serious enough to threaten his political career and hamstring his chances in a GOP presidential primary.

“It is a Cruz [we have] seen only one other time: the day after his speech at the 2016 Republican National Convention, when he refused to endorse Donald Trump. It took him months to recover his standing among the Republican base after that.

“Here, he is perceiving the same level of political threat among the base for having said, merely, that the 6 January riot was a ‘violent terrorist attack’.”

Whether Trump runs again or not, Newell wrote, “these will be the politics of the 2024 Republican presidential primary … condemnations of what happened at the Capitol on 6 January will be taboo.”

Cruz also took hits from the right. The Republican operative and Trump ally Roger Stone called him “a pandering, philandering asshole”. Ali Alexander, an operative in attempts to overturn the election, said Cruz was “dumb and lying”.

Hits came too from the notional centre, from factcheckers in particular.

For CNN, Daniel Dale pointed out that far from being “sloppy” on Wednesday, Cruz had called 6 January a terrorist attack at least 17 times before.

On air, Carlson ridiculed the idea.

“Of all the things that 6 January was,” he said, “it was definitely not a violent terrorist attack. It wasn’t an insurrection. Was it a riot? Sure. It was not a violent terrorist attack. Sorry.”

Many disagree. As the New York Times reported, “Congress has enacted a statute that defines domestic terrorism as criminal offenses that are dangerous to human life, lack a foreign nexus and appear to be seeking ‘to influence the policy of a government by intimidation or coercion’.”

Mary McCord, a senior national security official in the Obama and Trump administrations, told the paper some of the events of 6 January were therefore “acts of domestic terrorism, and that’s accurate regardless of whether it applies to each individual”.

Cruz would seem to agree, writing on Twitter: “I was ONLY talking about the limited number of people who committed violent assaults on police officers. For over a decade, I’ve referred to those who violently attack police officers as terrorists. If you assault a cop you should go to jail.”

But he also continued to apologise, to any Fox News viewers who might “misunderstand what I was saying”.

Amid the furore, some also chose to consider past statements by Carlson.

In the Washington Post, the columnist Greg Sargent pointed out: “Carlson himself has applied the T-label to … leftists, [calling] Black Lives Matter … a ‘terrorist organisation’.”",‘Weakness and surrender’: Ted Cruz seeks to move on from Tucker Carlson mauling,1

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez filing a restraining order against Republican Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, reports suggested Tuesday.

The Georgia Rep. has verbally confronted AOC on the House floor, asked her for a debate over her Green New Deal and has recently been condemned on both sides of the aisle for comparing masks mandates to the treatment of Jews during the Holocaust.

According to Politico, Democrats floated potential legal action but said the New York Democrat would likely have to file the order herself. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and her colleagues have also called for an ethics investigation into Greene's actions.

Earlier this month Greene demanded to know why AOC supported Black Lives Matter and antifa 'terrorists.'

She shouted 'Hey Alexandria' outside the House chamber.

AOC, a former bartender, later told reporters that Greene was the sort of customer she would toss out.

'These are the kinds of people that I threw out of bars all the time,' Ocasio-Cortez said.

Video from 2019 shows Greene previously standing outside of Ocasio-Cortez's locked Capitol Hill office. 'Get rid of your diaper,' Greene said in the footage, telling the liberal lawmaker to be a 'big girl.'

Greene's behavior previously prompted Pelosi to move Rep. Cori Bush's office away from her.

Bush, a Missouri Democrat, and Greene had a run-in in the hallway over mask-wearing.

Greene also trolled her office neighbor, Rep. Marie Newman, with a anti-trans sign after Newman, whose daughter is transgender, displayed a trans flag in the hallway.

Greene responded by hanging up a sign, 'There are TWO genders MALE & FEMALE. ‘Trust the science!'

The Democrats' bid to seek the restraining order was announced just days after AOC revealed she was in therapy after the Capitol riot.

Top Republicans, including House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, condemned Greene on Tuesday for comparing mask mandates and vaccine passports to the treatment of Jews during the Holocaust.

'Marjorie is wrong, and her intentional decision to compare the horrors of the Holocaust with wearing masks is appalling,' McCarthy, a California Republican, wrote on Twitter.

'Let me be clear: the House Republican Conference condemns this language.'

New Republican Conference Chair Elise Stefanik led the criticism from other members of her party by saying: 'Equating mask wearing and vaccines to the Holocaust belittles the most significant human atrocities ever committed.'

'We must all work together to educate our fellow Americans on the unthinkable horrors of the Holocaust. #NeverAgain,' she added.

Greene doubled down on Twitter Tuesday in claiming that her words are being twisted to say she compared mask mandates to the Holocaust.

'I never compared it to the Holocaust, only the discrimination against Jews in early Nazi years,' Greene tweeted.

'Stop feeding into the left wing media attacks on me,' she added. 'Everyone should be concerned about the squad's support for terrorists and discrimination against unvaxxed people. Why aren't they?'

No. 3 ranking House Republican Elise Stefanik said there needs to be progress on 'educating our fellow Americans on the unthinkable horrors of the Holocaust'

More than 70,000 people have signed a petition calling on McCarthy to expel Greene from Congress

The backlash from Republicans could lead to Greene being punished again.

In February she was stripped of her committee assignments for her past racist comments and sharing of QAnon conspiracy theories.

She also shared a story criticizing the Food City grocery store in Abingdon, Virginia, for having employees wear logos showing they are vaccinated, which she compared to Jews wearing a yellow star under the Nazis.

The tweet came in response to a post from conservative commentator Ben Shapiro, who wrote: 'I've also noticed that the media attention on MTG's bizarrely nutso Holocaust analogy are completely silent by the Squad's de facto support for genocidal anti-Jewish terrorist group Hamas.'

The controversy over Greene stems from her comments comparing Pelosi's mask mandates for unvaccinated lawmakers to rules imposed on Jews to identify themselves with a yellow star in Nazi Germany.

'You know, we can look back at a time in history where people were told to wear a gold star, and they were definitely treated like second class citizens, so much so that they were put in trains and taken to gas chambers in Nazi Germany,' Greene told David Brody on his Christian Broadcasting Network podcast 'The Water Cooler.'

GOP leaders are speaking out against Greene's repeated comparison.

House Minority Whip Scalise said he 'does not agree with these comments and condemns these comparisons to the Holocaust.'

'We also need to be speaking out strongly against the dangerous anti-Semitism that is growing in our streets and in the Democrat party, resulting in an alarming number of horrific violent attacks against Jews,' Scalise's spokesperson Lauren Fine said.

Greene doubled down on her comments on Monday by sharing a story of how vaccinated employees at a grocery store will wear a logo which she said was 'just like the Nazi's forced Jewish people to wear the gold star'

'I never compared it to the Holocaust,' Greene wrote in a tweet response to conservative commentator Ben Shapiro, who is Jewish

She said any sort of obvious identifier of a vaccine against coroanvirus is a slippery slope to requiring proof to go to school or use a certain bathroom

House Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, who is Jewish, called Greene's continued comparison 'sickening' and 'reprehensible' and called for her to 'stop this vile language immediately'

Congresswoman Mary Miller tweeted a selfie with Greene and two other GOP congressmen without masks on the House floor last week – going against Speaker Pelosi's rules requiring unvaccinated people to wear masks

Stefanik was voted to take over as No. 3 ranking Republican in the House after the party turned on previous chairwoman Liz Cheney of Wyoming after she broke with Donald Trump and refused to back his claims of voter fraud.

McCarthy's full statement on Greene's comments states: 'Marjorie is wrong, and her intentional decision to compare the horrors of the Holocaust with wearing masks is appalling. The Holocaust is the greatest atrocity committed in history. The fact that this needs to be stated today is deeply troubling.

'At a time when the Jewish people face increased violence and threats, anti-Semitism is on the rise in the Democrat Party and is completely ignored by Speaker Nancy Pelosi,' he continued.

'Americans must stand together to defeat anti-Semitism and any attempt to diminish the history of the Holocaust. Let me be clear: the House Republican Conference condemns this language.'

Greene tweeted earlier on Tuesday before McCarthy's statement emerged: 'Vaccinated employees get a vaccination logo just like the Nazi's forced Jewish people to wear a gold star. Vaccine passports & mask mandates create discrimination against unvaxxed people who trust their immune systems to a virus that is 99% survivable.'

Attached to the tweet was a news article about Food City supermarkets dropping mask requirements for vaccinated workers.

However, the southern grocery store chain went a step further by saying those employees who did get the hot will have a 'vaccination logo displayed on their name badge.'

Shapiro, who is Jewish, responded to Greene's post by writing: 'This is demented nonsense. It is nothing like the Holocaust, and any comparison thereto is both insulting and insane.'

Greene said Tuesday that media are 'twisting my words' to fit their narrative

Greene said it's a slippery slope to require some sort of identification on whether a person is vaccinated against coronavirus or not.

The Georgia representative tweeted: 'Pretty soon it will be.. 'We only hire vaccinated people, show your vax papers.' 'We only admit vaccinated students, show your vax papers.' 'These bathrooms are only for vaccinated people, show your vax papers.'

'Then.....scan your bar code or swipe your chip on your arm,' she predicted.

During Senate floor remarks on Tuesday, Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer also lashed out against Greene.

'This morning, Marjorie Taylor Greene, Republican congresswoman from Georgia, once again, compared preparations taken against COVID to the Holocaust,' Schumer, who is Jewish, said.

'These are sickening, reprehensible comments,' he added, 'and she should stop this vile language immediately.'

Greene on Saturday defended her comparison of mask mandates to Nazi Germany by claiming 'any ration Jewish person' doesn't like either.

'I think any rational Jewish person didn't like what happened in Nazi Germany and any rational Jewish person doesn't like what's happening with overbearing mask mandates and overbearing vaccine policies,' Greene told Arizona TV outlet 12 News on Saturday.

Anti-Semitism is on the rise in American and the world after a massive conflict broke out between Israel and Hamas operating in Gaza earlier this month. The conflict has left several hundred dead so far as bombings increase.

'Happening in Joe Biden's America,' Greene, 46, wrote on Twitter Sunday morning of a man beating a yarmulke-wearing Jewish man in New York.

The 23-year-old suspect said: 'If I could do it again, I would do it again. I have no problem doing it again.'

Greene, who represents Georgia's 14th congressional district in the House, compared Speaker Nancy Pelosi's new rule on face masks to the Holocaust.

Greene doubled-down on comparing House Speaker Nancy Pelosi requiring non-vaccinated lawmakers to wear masks to the 'gold star' of the Holocaust. 'I think any rational Jewish person didn't like what happened in Nazi Germany and any rational Jewish person doesn't like what's happening with overbearing mask mandates and overbearing vaccine policies'

She blamed President Joe Biden for the rise in anti-Semitic attacks. 'Happening in Joe Biden's America,' Greene wrote on Twitter of a man beating a yarmulke-wearing Jewish man in New York

She claimed Pelosi's decision to require proof of vaccination before members are allowed to take their masks off on the House floor to the 'Gold Star' Jewish people were forced to wear during the Holocaust.

'You know, we can look back at a time in history where people were told to wear a gold star, and they were definitely treated like second class citizens, so much so that they were put in trains and taken to gas chambers in Nazi Germany,' Greene told David Brody on his Christian Broadcasting Network podcast 'The Water Cooler.'

Cheney lashed out at Greene's comments in a tweet Saturday saying: 'This is evil lunacy.'

A reporter with News 12 asked Greene on Saturday: 'Do you understand, though, why some would be upset and offended by the comment?'

'Do you understand how people feel about being forced to wear masks, or being forced to have to take a vaccine, or even have to say whether they've taken it or not,' Greene shot back.

'These are just things that shouldn't be happening in America, this is a free country and it's just ridiculous to have these kind of conversations,' she continued.

Greene traveled to Arizona on Saturday with embattled Florida Representative Matt Gaetz as part of their 'America First' roadshow. Arizona is currently undergoing a massive recount effort as Donald Trump allies push the former president's claim that the 2020 election was 'rigged'.

'Here's what I stand by, we shouldn't be having this kind of treatment,' Greene said of Pelosi' requiring those in the lower chamber who opt not to get vaccinated to continue wearing a mask. 'No one should be treated like a second class citizen for saying, 'I don't need to wear a mask,' or saying that 'my medical records are my privacy based on my HIPPA rights.' And so I stand by all of my statements, I said nothing wrong.'

Greene compared a House of Representatives mask-wearing rule to the Holocaust on David Brody's podcast 'The Water Cooler'

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released guidance last earlier this month saying all fully vaccinated individuals no longer have to wear a mask indoors or outdoors.

Someone qualifies as a fully vaccinated individual two weeks after they received their final dose of the COVID-19 shot – whether it be the one or two-shot inoculation.

Republicans claim this is just another way to weed out anti-maskers and try to force them to get the vaccine.

Former Representative Denver Riggleman was among those who condemned Greene for her comments last week comparing the mandates to the genocide of 6 million Jewish people.

'Comparing wearing masks to the abuse of the Holocaust is a not so subtle diminution of the horrors experienced by millions,' he tweeted. 'It's a grotesque idiocy mixed with a neurotic lack of self awareness. What do you expect from a truther, Q believer, and gaslighting conspiracy theorist?'

Several Jewish groups, like the American Jewish Congress, and other individuals were quick to condemn the comparison

Political scientist Jasmin Mujanović wrote: 'This is antisemitism of a most despicable and deranged sort.

'This is a woman whose own politics can credibly be described as fascist trivializing the actual, historical facts of the Holocaust.

'And I repeat my prediction: she's a front runner for the 2024 GOP nomination.'

And Rhode Island Congressman David Cilline said: 'The Holocaust: The systematic murder of 6 million Jews. Mask-wearing: A simple act that costs you nothing and saves lives. Marjorie Taylor Greene: A troubled person who is unfit to serve in Congress.'

Jewish groups, like the American Jewish Congress, and many others quickly condemned the comments on social media as diminishing the six million Jewish people who died during the Holocaust.

'You can never compare health-related restrictions with yellow stars, gas chambers and other Nazi atrocities,' The American Jewish Congress tweeted on Friday. 'Such comparisons demean the Holocaust and contaminate American political speech.'

The group called for a retraction and apology from Greene, which she hasn't done to date.

Meanwhile, Greene took to Twitter Saturday morning to accuse fellow Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of supporting anti-Semitism.

She also branded AOC a 'terrorist' for supporting a cease in military funding for the Israeli government.

'.@AOC you're responsible for attacks on Jewish people bc of your hate-Israel stance against Israel's right to defend itself from from terrorists Hamas, calling Israel an apartheid state, & supporting terrorists groups. Aligning yourself with terrorists means your [sic] a terrorist,' Greene said in the tweet.

At the bottom of the tweet, Greene shared an image of AOC's call to end antisemitism next to a headline about her resolution that would cut funding for Israeli bombs.

Greene shot to fame for pushing a series of bizarre QAnon conspiracy theories before she was elected as a representative for Georgia's 14th congressional district in November 2020.

In a 2018 Facebook post, she claimed a 'Jewish space later' controlled by the Rothschild banking family had been used to ignite California wildfires.",Democrats tried to help AOC get a RESTRAINING ORDER against Marjorie Taylor Greene,1

Mike Mullen, former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff under the Bush and Obama administration stated that although he believes it was a genuine mistake, the US 'absolutely' needs to take responsibility for the attack.

Mullen was interviewed by ABC's Martha Raddatz, who asked him his stance on the issue after Head of US Central Command Gen. Frank McKenzie publicly apologized and recognized the mistake made by US intelligence that killed aid worker Zemari Ahmadi and nine family members who had no connection to ISIS-K.

'Tragic, tragic mistake and just, my heart goes out to the family members who were so deeply affected.

'I thought what general McKenzie did was right- admit and apologize and look-and he also spoke later of reparations,' Mullen said.

Mullen brought up reparations hinted in McKenzie's public apology, and a review of the military's inquiry into the attack ordered by Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin.

When asked if he thought there should be accountability, Mullen did not hesitate.

'Absolutely. I think there should. This was obviously an incredibly complex, fast-moving situation. We lost those 13 military members a couple of days before that,'

'There was clear intelligence that additional strikes were on the way, so it was in that environment in which this strike actually took place.'

'As sad as it was, and it was almost like you had an individual in a truck who was loading big water bottles. All of which sort of fitted. We just got caught up in the specifics of it,' he concluded.

'I offer my profound condolences to the family and friends of those who were killed,' McKenzie said in an apology in which the Pentagon took responsibility for the drone attack

The Pentagon admitted on Friday that the August 29 drone strike on a supposed ISIS-K operative instead killed an aid worker and 9 members of his family.

A drone had observed men loading what were thought to be explosives into a vehicle, but were actually jugs of water.

Head of US Central Command Gen. Frank McKenzie admitted the strike was a 'terrible mistake' while addressing reporters Friday and said it was 'unlikely that the vehicle and those who died were associated with ISIS-K or a direct threat to U.S. forces.'

'It was a mistake and I offer my sincere apology,' McKenzie said.

The deadly drone strike set off a large secondary explosion, which officials originally claimed was evidence the car was indeed carrying explosives, but an investigation determined was likely a propane tank located in the driveway.

'I offer my profound condolences to the family and friends of those who were killed,' McKenzie continued.

'The strike was taken in the earnest belief that it would prevent an imminent threat to our forces and evacuees at the airport.

'But it was a mistake and I offer my sincere apology, as the combatant commander, responsible for this strike and this tragic outcome.'

Mullen said the Biden administration should also be held accountable for the death of the 13 US service members.

'I also think there should be accountability there as well. I hope there is,' he added.

However, the former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff contended there was nothing abnormal in the conversations between Gen Mark Milley and Chinese official after the Capital riot.

'Having communications with counterparts around the world is routine, and even having them now with China.'

'There was a time when we had no communications with China, or we'd have a problem with China, they'd cut off all mil-to-mil connections. And so, actually, I'm encouraged at the fact that the line of communication is there,' Mullen said.

Boris Johnson and his top two scientific advisers tonight wheeled out a set of striking statistics laying bare Britain's Covid-19 divide between the North and the South, as the Prime Minister warned of a second 'more costly' lockdown unless the outbreak tails off.

In a rallying cry urging Britons to keep fighting the disease to protect the NHS and save lives, Mr Johnson insisted the country knows how to drive down the virus because 'we did it before'. And in warning the UK had reached a 'critical moment', he vowed not to 'throw in the sponge' and pledged to bring in tougher measures if needed.

And in a defiant message to Tory hawks desperate to reopen the economy faster, the PM insisted that letting the virus 'take its course', in a Sweden-style approach, risked overwhelming the NHS and causing thousands more deaths. He also warned it was too early to judge whether the Rule of Six and 10pm curfew were working.

Top experts have repeatedly warned that Britain needs to learn to live with Covid-19 because it will be with us for generations. Businesses fear tougher measures — similar to ones imposed in the first draconian lockdown — would cripple the economy even further.

Mr Johnson addressed the nation alongside Professor Chris Whitty and Sir Patrick Vallance, despite coming under intense pressure drop scientists from such briefings amid complaints they are being used as 'propaganda' to back up increasingly draconian restrictions.

The trio presented maps that starkly exposed the North-South coronavirus divide. And official data shows that the average number of positive tests each day is at least twice as high in North West England as in any other region, and that Scotland's cases are 14 times higher than they were at the beginning of August, outpacing England's outbreak.

An average 1,595 cases of Covid-19 are being diagnosed in the North West every day now, compared to just 150 in the South West, while Yorkshire and the Humber and the North East face the second highest infection rates. All of the 10 areas with the worst case-per-person ratios are in the north, while eight of 10 of those with the lowest are in the south. Professor Whitty said there was a 'heavy concentration' of coronavirus towards the top of England.

In a plea to the public the Prime Minister said: 'If we put in the work together now then we give ourselves the best possible chance of avoiding that outcome and avoiding further measures.'

'I know some people will think we should give up and let the virus take its course despite the huge loss of life that would potentially entail. I have to say I profoundly disagree. I don't think that is what the British people want. I don't think they want to throw in the sponge. They want to fight and defeat this virus and that is what we are going to do.'

'Even as we fight Covid, it is vital that people get all the treatment they need for other conditions. But I must be clear, if the NHS were to be overwhelmed by covid, then no-one could get any such care.'

Highlighting the sharp rise in infections and defending his recent comments warning that the UK could see 50,000 coronavirus cases a day by mid-October, Sir Patrick said grimly: 'Things are definitely going in the wrong direction.'

Professor Whitty slapped back at critics, saying they had accused him of being 'too optimistic and too pessimistic on numbers'. But he said that in March the government failed to recognise how fast the virus was spreading and the mistake could not be repeated. In a gloomy message, he said: 'We have a long winter ahead of us.'

Earlier, Mr Johnson finally bowed to demand to give MPs a vote before any fresh lockdown restrictions - after furious Speaker Lindsay Hoyle blasted him for treating the Commons with 'contempt'.

In another frantic day in the coronavirus crisis:

The UK recorded 7,108 more coronavirus cases and another 71 deaths today — including a three-month high of seven in Scotland;

The Bank of England's chief economist Andy Haldane has called for optimism on the country's prospects, warning that a 'Chicken Licken' attitude could harm the recovery;

Business Secretary Alok Sharma faced a backlash after blaming 'gotcha' questions for the PM's muddle over the North East lockdown rules yesterday;

Ministers fear that the public is showing increasing signs of 'lockdown fatigue' as the pandemic drags on and the rules become more complicated;

The Prime Minister displayed the latest slides on the status of coronavirus at the No10 press conference tonight

Chief medical officer Chris Whitty and chief science officer Patrick Vallance were in Whitehall today for the Cabinet meeting

Data presented by Professor Whitty in the televised briefing showed a clear north-south divide in the coronavirus infections across England.

The scientific advisers admitted the top half of the country is clearly worse affected than the bottom, but insisted 'it would be wrong' to think the problem isn't nationwide.

A heat map of infection rates across the country showed that almost all of the South West, South East, East Midlands and the East of England were shaded in the lightest possible colour, meaning the numbers of cases are below the average for England.

WHY IS THE OUTBREAK NOW CENTERED IN THE NORTH? Gloomy government statistics wheeled out at the No10 press conference tonight show cases are rocketing in the North and in Scotland. But Boris Johnson or Downing St's top two scientific advisers, Sir Patrick Vallance and Professor Chris Whitty were unable to offer any explanation as to why. Top scientists have speculated it could be down to the North having lower levels of immunity from Britain's first wave in the spring. For instance, government advisers estimate around 17 per cent of people living in the capital have developed Covid-19 antibodies — suggesting they have already had and beaten the virus. But the rate for the rest of the UK is believed to be lower than 10 per cent. Academics warned the virus would have thrived in London before the lockdown on March 23, because of how densely populated the city of 9million is, with buses and Tubes packed full. Thousands of tourists — who possibly could have been carrying the disease — were also allowed to fly in and enjoy the capital's attractions without being checked. One expert did not play down the theory that the North could now be being battered by the second wave because of its gloomier weather. Several studies have explored the possible link between weather and Covid-19 outbreaks but have yet to make a clear consensus. Manchester's average temperature in August is around 16C (60F) but drops to below 13C (55F) in September — the two months when cases began to spiral in the North West. It is even colder in Scotland. For reference, London is only slightly warmer than Manchester. The capital's average temperature stands at around 19C (66F) in August and 17C (63F) in September. Dr John McCauley, one of the world's most eminent scientists on flu, told MailOnline that people are driven inside when it is raining and cold. But he admitted it would be very 'tricky' to firm up the link. Dr McCauley, of London's Francis Crick Institute, pointed to flu outbreaks in Ireland and Poland, where the climates are 'very different' but the seasonality of the virus is 'pretty similar'. Poland's winter can see temperatures regularly dip below freezing, forcing people to stay inside. Ireland tends to be battered by heavy winds and rain. Cold and flu viruses are known to thrive indoors, and experts say the coronavirus — which spreads through coughs, sneezes, and breathing — will be no exception to the trend. Respiratory viruses also prefer the winter because people spend more time together indoors, where they are forced into closer contact than they would be in the park in summer. The closer together people are, the more likely they are to spread the virus between them. Dr McCauley also told MailOnline the outbreak in the North could simply be down to bad luck. But Professor Anthony Brookes, an expert in genomics at the University of Leicester, said researchers 'struggle' to understand what is truly going on because of a lack of data on testing for the different regions. 'They do release for whole country, but per region per day - that’s what’s missing. That makes it difficult to dissect what’s going on in different regions at different times. We are only left with number of positive cases detected. ‘Nevertheless, given that caveat about not having the number of tests done per day per region, one can estimate this. 'And doing so suggests there really is no second wave in London. That is, however, quite the opposite is true up north.’ Advertisement

The average infection rate for the country as a whole was 35.7 cases per 100,000 as at Public Health England's latest official update last Friday.

Colour-coding showed the problem is worst in the North West around Liverpool and Manchester and also in the far North East, towards Newcastle.

Much of those two regions and the West Midlands - and to a lesser extent London and Cornwall - were shown in a darker colour, indicating case rates are near or above average.

Professor Whitty said: 'At this point in time there is a very heavy concentration in particular areas - in particular in the North West, the North East and parts of the Midlands…

'There’s a general increase [in the rate of infection] across the whole of England and the same is also true in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland… but a very rapid increase in particular areas; again, particularly in the North East, North West and areas of the Midlands [but] not exclusively.'

Numbers of positive tests reported by the Department of Health reflect what was shown in the map, with the North West reporting significantly more cases than any other region.

In the week up to September 23 - the most recent data available - there were an average of 1,595 cases diagnosed each day in the crisis-hit region.

This was more than double the 663 daily average in Yorkshire and the Humber, three times as high as the 564 in the West Midlands and 551 in the North East.

It blows the more southern regions, except London (471 per day), out of the water.

In the East Midlands there were 274 cases per day over the same seven-day period, along with 227 in the South East, 185 in the East of England and just 150 in the South West.

This means that the looming threat of a national lockdown, which Mr Johnson today said he didn't want to resort to but would if he had to, places millions of people at risk of being lumped under tight restrictions because of the actions of people hundreds of miles away.

MPs have already cautioned against 'broad brush' tactics that see people in less-affected areas unfairly punished.

But Sir Patrick Vallance insisted in today's conference: 'It would be wrong to take from this that this is a problem that's only in certain areas.

'It is worse in certain areas but there is evidence of spread everywhere, and we need to be mindful of that and everyone needs to take precautions across the country.'

The images presented at the briefing mirror what is shown in Public Health England's data.

Of the 48 areas in the 'intervention' category on PHE's watchlist, none are further south than the Midlands.

Birmingham and nearby Sandwell, as well as Leicester and Oadby and Wigston, are the furthest south areas to have any local lockdown measures in place.

Eight out of 10 areas with the lowest infection rates per 100,000 people are in the south of England - the Isle of Wight, Somerset, East Sussex, Dorset, Devon, Wokingham, Swindon and Torbay. Suffolk in the East and Herefordshire in the West Midlands complete the list.

And all 10 of the areas with the highest infection rates are in the north - Bolton, South Tyneside, Blackburn with Darwen, Knowsley, Halton, Liverpool, Bury, Newcastle, Manchester and Oldham.

Frustration is growing with local lockdowns in these areas, however, and MailOnline understands Cabinet hawks are increasingly frustrated by the dire warnings from the medical and science chiefs about a second wave.

Former Downing Street aides have been calling on the government to take the experts out of the limelight, warning they are not great communicators and it gave the impression decisions were clear cut rather than a matter of judgement for ministers.

CASES ARE RISING QUICKER IN SCOTLAND THAN IN ENGLAND, DATA SHOWS Official testing data shows that the number of cases is rising significantly faster in Scotland than it is in England. Although there are fewer infections north of the border, the daily average number of cases is now almost 14 times higher than it was at the beginning of August, whereas England's has increased five-fold in comparison. The figures suggested Scotland outbreak is accelerating at a rate three times higher than England's. In the first week of August there were an average 38 cases per day diagnosed in Scotland. This rolling average has since surged 1,252 per cent to 514 yesterday. In England, meanwhile, the average of 807 cases per day recorded in the first week of August has risen by a comparatively smaller 445 per cent up to September 28. Today's and yesterday's data cannot be used for the comparison because the numbers are low as the positive tests are not all recorded on the day. And Scotland's cases surged to an all-time high of 806 on September 29 up from a low of just two positive cases on July 7. Meanwhile England's hit a ceiling of 7,143 yesterday, September 29, up from a low point of 398 on July 14. England's increase has been of around 1,700 per cent - some 17 times higher - while Scotland's has boomed more than 400 times over. The increase will be particularly worrying and disappointing for the nation, which came closer than any other part of the UK to wiping out the disease, with a month-long spell without a single death between July 17 and July 18.

Senior Conservative Sir Bernard Jenkin upped the ante today by swiping that the government is using 'science as propaganda'.

Prof Whitty told the Downing Street briefing there was a 'significant rise' in test positivity in the north-east and north-west of England, and Yorkshire and Humber.

'This increase is accelerating quite rapidly in some of those areas,' he said.

He said that rates in school age children 'are really not changing very much'.

But he said hospitalisation is rising, particularly in hotspots, though the figures remain 'in a much lower level than at the beginning of April'.

Professor Whitty added: 'We are pointing out that the direction of travel for both hospitals and intensive care is going in the wrong direction, particularly in these areas that have seen rapid increases in cases.'

Sir Patrick said: 'It is very clear that rates are still going up. And, so, we don't have this under control at the moment.

'And the increases that Chris (Whitty) has described in some areas are of concern, and… will lead to further problems.'

Mr Johnson said the way the virus is spreading may be different now to the way it was in March.

'We are seeing some very clear local peaks,' he said.

'It may be that this is a more localised phenomenon this time in which case all the more reason for us to concentrate on these local solutions as well as these national solutions.'

Professor Whitty said that although the virus was not doubling as quickly as it was in March, the numbers could pick up again quickly.

'This small number of deaths now shouldn't reassure us that we won't be, in relatively short order, in quite difficult places, certainly in the regions where we are seeing significant growth at the moment.'

The North-South divide was highlighted after Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham warned that coronavirus could be worse for the north of England than Margaret Thatcher.

Mr Burnham said local restrictions to combat the spread of the virus could 'massively increase' England's North-South divide and called for more support for businesses in Bolton, which has the strictest lockdown measures in the region.

The Conservative leader of Bolton Council, David Greenhalgh, also said he was pleading with the Government to recognise the disparity between boroughs as he claimed the town's hospitality businesses had been 'thrown to the lions'.

Speaking at a weekly coronavirus press briefing, Mr Burnham said: 'If we go into a winter with the north under local restrictions, millions of people under restrictions, businesses suffering because of those restrictions, no support for those businesses, we are going to see a widening of the north-south divide.

WHITTY SAYS CASES ARE NOT SPIRALLING OUT OF CONTROL IN SCHOOLS Coronavirus cases are not spiralling out of control in schools, Professor Chris Whitty insisted tonight. England's Chief Medical Officer said rates are not going up for school-age children — under the age of 16. And in tonight's Number 10 press conference, he claimed the trend was true 'across the country'. But he warned this wasn't the case for 17 to 21 year olds, where outbreaks are getting bigger 'quite rapidly'. The figures come after unions and scientists warned that the return of schools would cause an explosion in cases which, although children do not seem to get ill with Covid-19, could have put the health of staff and parents at risk. Justifying his claims about schools in a clear graph, Professor Whitty presented official data on test positivity rates for five different age groups. Test positivity reveals how many people who think they have Covid-19 actually do and is a measure that can be used to track infections without the influence of the total numbers of cases, which can fluctuate unreliably as more or fewer tests are carried out. Professor Whitty's data that he pointed to showed test positivity rates have soared to around 12.9 per cent among 19 to 21 year olds, doubling from 6 per cent at the start of the month. But he failed to offer any explanation as to why. The data presented at tonight's press conference — which saw Boris Johnson warn of a second lockdown unless the outbreak tails off — also showed the test positivity rate has jumped to around 9.6 per cent in 17 and 18 year olds. For comparison, it had stayed fairly stable at below 7.5 per cent in the first two weeks of September. But rates have barely changed among five to 10 year olds (1.5 per cent), 11 to 14 year olds (2.2 per cent) and 15 and 16 year olds (3.8 per cent). Advertisement

'If you look back in years to come you'll think Covid-19 did more harm to the north of England than Margaret Thatcher and whatever she did in the 1980s.

'This is a real danger that is staring us right in the face.

'A government that says it wants to level up cannot put the north of England under restrictions without support. It's pretty much as simple as that.'

He said he believed Bolton, where restaurants and pubs are only allowed to provide takeaway food and drink, had been 'forgotten about' by national politicians.

He added: 'There are many places today that have a higher case rate than Bolton but their hospitality remains open and it's this lack of consistency that I think is making people lose faith in what is going on.

'The sense of injustice in Bolton is very, very real today.

'I would say it's simple – either the Government closes hospitality in areas with higher case rates, with full compensation by the way.

'If they're not prepared to do that, they should let Bolton open. It's got to be one or the other.'

Mr Greenhalgh told BBC News the restrictions, imposed earlier this month, were 'breeding resentment' among residents.

He said: 'I still think there's an element of Government, because the restrictions are so complex, that doesn't understand the huge disparities there are up and down the country.'

Earlier, Health Secretary Matt Hancock announced the concessions in the House, saying the government would 'consult Parliament' on any England-wide or UK-wide restrictions, and a vote will be held in advance 'wherever possible'.

'Today I can confirm to the House that for significant national measures, with effect in the whole of England or UK-wide, we will consult Parliament – wherever possible we will hold votes before such regulations come into force,' he said.

'But of course responding to the virus means that the Government must act with speed when required and we cannot hold up urgent regulations which are needed to control the virus and save lives.'

Sir Graham Brady, who led the Tory revolt, welcomed the climbdown - which followed weeks of rising tensions with the backbenches.

The move came after Sir Lindsay delivered an extraordinary rebuke, complaining that sweeping powers for ministers to deal with the public health crisis were being abused.

Reading the riot act to the PM as he sat silently in the chamber, Sir Lindsay made clear that he is ready to side with dozens of Tory rebels and opposition parties to ensure more scrutiny - warning that the government's must act now to restore 'trust'.

DATA CONFIRMS NORTH-SOUTH DIVIDE IN ENGLAND Data presented by Professor Whitty in the televised briefing showed a clear north-south divide in the coronavirus infections across England. Cases are clearly surging faster and to higher levels across the North West and North East of the country, while the South West and South East look almost unaffected. The scientific advisers admitted the top half of the country is clearly worse affected than the bottom, but insisted 'it would be wrong' to think the problem isn't nationwide. A heat map of infection rates across the country showed that almost all of the South West, South East, East Midlands and the East of England were shaded in the lightest possible colour, meaning the numbers of cases are below the average for England.

This was more than double the 663 daily average in Yorkshire and the Humber, three times as high as the 564 in the West Midlands and 551 in the North East. It blows the more southern regions, except London (471 per day), out of the water. In the East Midlands there were 274 cases per day over the same seven-day period, along with 227 in the South East, 185 in the East of England and just 150 in the South West. This means that the looming threat of a national lockdown, which Mr Johnson today said he didn't want to resort to but would if he had to, places millions of people at risk of being lumped under tight restrictions because of the actions of people hundreds of miles away. MPs have already cautioned against 'broad brush' tactics that see people in less-affected areas unfairly punished. But Sir Patrick Vallance insisted in today's conference: 'It would be wrong to take from this that this is a problem that's only in certain areas. 'It is worse in certain areas but there is evidence of spread everywhere, and we need to be mindful of that and everyone needs to take precautions across the country.' The images presented at the briefing mirror what is shown in Public Health England's data. Of the 48 areas in the 'intervention' category on PHE's watchlist, none are further south than the Midlands. Birmingham and nearby Sandwell, as well as Leicester and Oadby and Wigston, are the furthest south areas to have any local lockdown measures in place. Eight out of 10 areas with the lowest infection rates per 100,000 people are in the south of England - the Isle of Wight, Somerset, East Sussex, Dorset, Devon, Wokingham, Swindon and Torbay. Suffolk in the East and Herefordshire in the West Midlands complete the list. And all 10 of the areas with the highest infection rates are in the north - Bolton, South Tyneside, Blackburn with Darwen, Knowsley, Halton, Liverpool, Bury, Newcastle, Manchester and Oldham.

'The Government must make greater efforts to prepare measures more quickly, so that this House can debate and decide upon the most significant measures at the earliest possible point,' he said.

'I am now looking to the Government to rebuild the trust with this House and not treat it with the contempt that it has shown.'

The Speaker did reject an amendment tabled by Tory rebels to a motion renewing the Coronavirus Act powers, that would have forced votes before new measures are imposed - saying it would breach parliamentary procedure. However, the intervention was enough to trigger an immediate shift from the government.

In an extraordinary attack in the Commons - which Mr Johnson had to sit and listen to - Sir Lindsay slammed the way the government was railroading through restrictions.

'The way in which the Government has exercised its powers to make secondary legislation during this crisis has been totally unsatisfactory,' he said.

'All too often, important statutory instruments have been published a matter of hours before they come into force, and some explanations why important measures have come into effect before they can be laid before this House have been unconvincing and shows a total disregard for the House.

'The Government must make greater efforts to prepare measures more quickly, so that this House can debate and decide upon the most significant measures at the earliest possible point.'

He added: 'I am now looking to the Government to rebuild the trust with this House and not treat it with the contempt that it has shown.'

Mr Johnson did not make any reference to the stinging criticism from the Speaker as he took to his feet for PMQs afterwards.

Disquiet has been growing among MPs about the influence of Prof Whitty and Sir Patrick over the government's approach.

One Cabinet 'hawk' told MailOnline that Mr Johnson had no choice but to act given the dire warnings he was getting. 'You can understand why the PM has to be cautious when he is being told that tens of thousands of people are going to die,' they said.

The minister added that the government was getting advice more 'widely' from experts now. 'The hawks in the Cabinet are a lot happier with the spread of opinion than they were,' they said.

The source pointed out that the was a huge range of opinion among scientists, and ministers had to be confident to take a view. 'Earlier in the crisis we were a lot more in thrall of the scientists. But there is a huge difference between doubling every seven days and every 20 days,' they said.

'We are talking more widely to people with different views. It might be that people like Carl Heneghan have the right assessment. '

'The modelling is not at all accurate. It just gives you general idea of what might happen.'

The PM gathered his Cabinet this morning after embarrassingly getting muddled about the draconian rules imposed on households mixing in the North East.

The blunder elicited a rare apology from Mr Johnson, who admitted he had 'misspoken' by suggesting different households could still legally socialise in groups of six indoors.

Tory MPs insisted if Mr Johnson cannot 'keep up' with the changes being by the government there is no hope for ordinary members of the public.

But Business Secretary Alok Sharma swatted away the criticism this morning, accusing journalists of 'gotcha' questions and turning the situation into a 'quiz show' - saying people should check council websites rather than listening to the PM.

'There is an element of slightly 'gotcha' about this in terms of this line of questioning. You are a flagship programme when it comes to serious news and it is not a quiz show,' he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.

Asked whether he thought that calling on ministers to explain what their coronavirus regulations were was as 'trivial as a quiz question', he said: 'No, absolutely not. But what I'm saying to you is that what is important is if people want to understand the precise restrictions that they have in areas which are more restricted, then they should go on to the (local authority) websites.'

A dire day for the government kicked off yesterday when skills minister Gillian Keegan suffered a series of car crash interviews Tuesday morning, admitting she was unable to answer key questions over new curbs that came into effect from midnight.

Quizzed on the North East lockdown after a speech at Exeter College in Devon later, Mr Johnson said: 'On the rule of six, outside the areas such as the North East where extra measures have been brought in, it is six inside, six outside.

Coronavirus 'could be worse for North-South divide than Thatcher', says Manchester mayor Coronavirus could be worse for the north of England than Margaret Thatcher, Greater Manchester mayor Andy Burnham has said. Mr Burnham said local restrictions to combat the spread of the virus could 'massively increase' England's north-south divide and called for more support for businesses in Bolton, which has the strictest lockdown measures in the region. The Conservative leader of Bolton Council, David Greenhalgh, also said he was pleading with the Government to recognise the disparity between boroughs as he claimed the town's hospitality businesses had been 'thrown to the lions'. Speaking at a weekly coronavirus press briefing, Mr Burnham said: 'If we go into a winter with the north under local restrictions, millions of people under restrictions, businesses suffering because of those restrictions, no support for those businesses, we are going to see a widening of the north-south divide. 'If you look back in years to come you'll think Covid-19 did more harm to the north of England than Margaret Thatcher and whatever she did in the 1980s. 'This is a real danger that is staring us right in the face. 'A government that says it wants to level up cannot put the north of England under restrictions without support. It's pretty much as simple as that.' Advertisement

'And in the North East and other areas where extra tight measures have been brought in you should follow the guidance of the local authorities.

'But it's six in a home or six in hospitality, but as I understand it not six outside. That is the situation there.'

Whitehall sources claimed No10 had been blindsided by Matt Hancock's decision to press ahead with the new restrictions, which had not been expected until at least the end of this week.

Former minister Steve Baker, one of the rebel ringleaders pushing for parliament to get a bigger role in deciding lockdown, said it demonstrated the confusion that was being caused.

He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: 'I think it was a vivid illustration of the problems you have when a hundred Acts of Parliament are used to put in place 247, I think it is, pieces of delegated legislation … which are subject to repeated amendment and revocation.

'When you get such a large and shifting body of law, you find even ministers and the Prime Minister cannot keep up with it.

'What possible hope can the public have? I had one minister say to me yesterday, with terror in his eyes about the disease, we might have to change the law every 24 hours.

'We can't possibly expect 70 million people to keep up with law that changes every 24 hours – this would be chaos and ruin.'

Senior Tory Sir Bernard Jenkin also turned up the temperature by accusing ministers of using science for 'propaganda'.

'We saw during the Iraq war, intelligence being used as a propaganda,' he told Times Radio.

'The scientists are not there to explain what the government has judged necessary to do'.

Mr Sharma defended the way restrictions were being rushed through.

'The reason we are sometimes having to bring these in pretty quickly is to actually keep people safe - and I know all parliamentarians, Steve (Baker) and others totally get that - and the issue is the scrutiny,' he said.

'It is the case that when we've introduced restrictions, we have to make sure there is a vote within 28 days or they lapse.

'But what colleagues are asking for is if there is some way, prior to decisions being made, whether they can be involved and I know that is something that we are looking at in Government and we will come forward with some suggestions.'

Reading the riot act to the PM as he sat silently in the chamber, Sir Lindsay made clear that he is ready to side with dozens of Tory rebels and opposition parties to ensure more scrutiny - warning that the government's must act now to restore 'trust'

LIVERPOOL IS BEING 'CLOSELY MONITORED' OVER SPIKE IN CASES The weekly infection rate in Liverpool now stands at 258.4 per 100,000 people. Liverpool would be the first city to have a two-week lockdown Number 10 today said it was 'closely monitoring' Liverpool's rising infection rate after its mayor said the city was just 'days away' from having to introduce a two-week circuit-breaker lockdown. Boris Johnson's official spokesman said officials are 'constantly reviewing' the area's coronavirus restrictions - after Liverpool Mayor Joe Anderson called for a full lockdown to restrict the virus from spreading. The weekly infection rate in Liverpool now stands at 258.4 per 100,000 people. It would be the first city to have a two-week lockdown, which could also include parts of the wider region. However, at a conference of local leaders this afternoon, Metro Mayor Steve Rotherham distanced himself from Mr Anderson's call for a two-week lockdown and said he had never discussed this idea with the Government in Westminster. Mr Rotherham said he is meeting with all the region's leaders meeting after the press conference. The North East was made subject to new restrictions this morning, with people banned from meeting anyone inside unless they are part of their Covid bubble. However this stopped short of a full lockdown that would shut pubs and restaurants. Advertisement

Pressed on whether there were concessions coming, the minister said: 'We are having a look, as I said - I don't want to pre-empt anything that comes out.'

The PM's blunder had uncomfortable echoes of the skit by Lucas, which was aired at the start of the Great British Bake Off on Channel 4 last week.

It saw the comedian dressed up as Mr Johnson taking a faux press conference in Downing Street. Ridiculing the complicated rules, Lucas urged people to 'bake in a tent' if they must, before adding: 'Don't bake in a tent.'

The Government has been desperately trying all week to soothe a mutiny among dozens of MPs who had lined up behind the amendment tabled by backbench chief Sir Graham Brady.

It insisted that Commons votes should be held before any future curbs are put in place.

But one Tory MP in the North East told the Telegraph: 'What happened with Boris only strengthened the argument for greater parliamentary scrutiny of new rules. He can't work out what the rules are because there is no logic to them.'

Mr Johnson rushed to defuse the row over his muffed explanation of lockdown within hours, issuing a rare apology.

'Apologies, I misspoke today,' he wrote.

'In the North East, new rules mean you cannot meet people from different households in social settings indoors, including in pubs, restaurants and your home.

'You should also avoid socialising with other households outside.

'This is vital to control the spread of coronavirus and keep everyone safe. If you are in a high risk area, please continue to follow the guidelines from local authorities.'

While the PM has defended their advice and expertise that has led to local lockdowns and early closures of pubs, Tory MPs have vented their ire on the pair in recent days, with calls for them to be sacked.

The government's use of the sweeping powers it was granted by Parliament at the start of the coronavirus crisis has been causing increasing discontent among Tories.

The Coronavirus Act 2020 - which underpins the lockdown along with the Health Protection Act 1984 - has to be renewed every six months, with a vote due tomorrow.

But ministers have been trying to find a settlement with Sir Graham's band of rebels after they threatened to derail the process. The government is now expected to commit to holding votes where practical before any further restrictions are imposed.

Senior Tory Steve Baker has likened some of the Government's coronavirus restrictions to George Orwell's dystopian novel 1984, specifically referencing a ban on singing and dancing in bars, cafes and restaurants.

The PM is also under mounting pressure from hard-hit hospitality bosses demanding the 10pm curfew be constantly reviewed.

More than 100 of the UK's biggest restaurant chains including Wetherspoon and Pizza Hut wrote to Mr Johnson urging a three-week review - and for it to be axed if ineffective at tackling the steep rise in cases.

Mr Johnson appealed to MPs to renew the powers in the Coronavirus Act, saying the nation remained in a 'serious situation'.

'Nobody wants to do these kinds of things. Nobody in their right mind wants to stop people singing and dancing in pubs or enjoying themselves in the normal way,' he told the press conference.

'I appreciate the (Orwell) characterisation but if we all work together and get this thing down, get this virus down, then we can keep going with our strategy, keep education open, keep the economy moving and work for the day, as I say, when I believe that those medical scientific improvements will truly deliver the long-term liberation we need.

'And to deliver it we've all basically got to work together and follow the guidance. That's what I respectfully say to my colleagues in Parliament and they will, as I know they all want, have an opportunity to talk about these issues, to debate them properly, and discuss them as parliamentarians should.'

He also reiterated his commitment to give more regular debates on coronavirus in the Commons and promised that MPs will be able to question the Government's scientific advisers more regularly.

Health Secretary Matt Hancock announced the concessions in the House, saying the government would 'consult Parliament' on any England-wide or UK-wide restrictions, and a vote will be held in advance 'wherever possible'

Ex-No10 adviser urges PM to ditch scientists Boris Johnson should stop relying on scientists and 'take responsibility' for decisions, a former No10 adviser has said. James Frayne, who conducted focus groups and polling for the Cabinet Office but has now stopped, made the call as he critiqued the government's performance. In an article on ConservativeHome.com, Mr Frayne said that 'PR Advice 101' was to 'wheel out the independent experts that the public trust, and play down the role of politicians'. 'So we've seen nothing but Government scientists for months,' he said. 'There are two problems with this approach. Firstly, it has implied that the scientists are ultimately in control of the situation and that there are simple, empirical decisions which can and must be made. 'This isn't true, and has given the public a false sense of security. 'Secondly, most of the scientists are poor communicators. The media love the idea of the boring, trusted scientist that the public all love. But this isn't reality. 'The scientists aren't professional communicators and putting them in positions of public influence in this way is a mistake.' He went on: 'The Government needs to show some balls and downgrade the scientists' role as communicators, and take responsibility for what are essentially political decisions.' Advertisement

However, after the Prime Minister's plea, further pressure came from the senior group of MPs on the Liaison Committee, which gets to question Mr Johnson in the Commons.

Senior Tory MP Sir Bernard Jenkin, writing to Mr Johnson as committee chair, said the 'majority of us' support Parliament having a vote 'before or immediately after' restrictions come into force.

'The idea that such restrictions can be applied without express parliamentary approval, except in dire emergency, is not widely acceptable and indeed may be challenged in law,' Sir Bernard said.

Measures have been tightened in Northumberland, Newcastle, North and South Tyneside, Gateshead, Sunderland and County Durham.

Aimed at stopping a resurgence of coronavirus, the Department of Health said laws would ban inter-household mixing indoors, including in pubs and restaurants.

But it left questions about whether the measures, to be enforced with fines, would include meeting people from other homes outside in hospitality settings.

Asked on BBC Radio 4's Today programme yesterday, Ms Keegan said: 'I'm sorry I can't clarify that.

'I don't know the answer to that question but I'm sure they can find out the answer to that question.'

Pressed on how people are meant to keep up to date with the latest restrictions when even ministers cannot, she said: 'I'm sorry I can't answer that question. I'm sure there are many people who could. I don't represent the North East.'

Tory disquiet over new rules, regulations and fines also increased after it emerged the authorities will have the power to use 'reasonable force' to make people self-isolate.

New laws published by the Government state that 'reasonable force' can be used if someone refuses to comply with an instruction to stay at home after testing positive for coronavirus or if they have been in contact with someone else who has the disease.

The power will be available to all 'authorised persons' amid reports that could include so-called 'Covid marshalls' as well as the police and council staff.",Boris Johnson warns 'more costly' NATIONAL lockdown can't be ruled out,1
https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/dec/29/indictment-of-proud-boys-leaders-charged-over-us-capitol-attack-upheld,1,"A federal judge has refused to dismiss an indictment charging four alleged Proud Boys leaders with conspiracy and obstructing an official proceeding during the 6 January attack on the US Capitol – a development that could have potential implications for Donald Trump.

On Tuesday, the US district judge Timothy Kelly rejected arguments by defence lawyers that Ethan Nordean, Joseph Biggs, Zachary Rehl and Charles Donohoe are charged with conduct that is protected by the first amendment right to free speech.

He said they had multiple nonviolent options to express their opinions about the 2020 presidential election, in which former president Trump lost to Joe Biden.

“Defendants are not, as they argue, charged with anything like burning flags, wearing black armbands, or participating in mere sit-ins or protests,” he wrote in a 43-page ruling. “Moreover, even if the charged conduct had some expressive aspect, it lost whatever first amendment protection it may have had.”

As reported by the Guardian last week, expectation is growing that Trump may face charges for trying to obstruct Congress from certifying Biden’s election this year as a House panel is collecting more evidence into the attack.

Evidence against the former president could include his involvement in the “Stop the Steal” rally near the White House where he called on supporters to march to the Capitol and “fight like hell [or] you’re not going to have a country any more”.

Federal prosecutors have so far cited the obstruction statute in about 200 cases involving rioters charged by the Department of Justice for their involvement in the attack, supported by recent rulings by Trump-appointed district court judges.

Nordean, Biggs, Rehl and Donohoe, who are jailed while they await a trial scheduled for May, were indicted in March on charges including conspiracy and obstructing an official proceeding.

Nordean, from Auburn, Washington, was a Proud Boys chapter president and member of its national “elders council”. Biggs, from Ormond Beach, Florida, is a self-described Proud Boys organiser. Rehl was president of the group’s chapter in Philadelphia and Donohoe, from Kernersville, North Carolina, was president of his local chapter, according to the indictment.

Defence lawyers also argued the obstruction charge was not applicable to their clients’ cases because they claimed the certification of the electoral college by Congress was not an “official proceeding”, but Kelly disagreed.

Earlier this month another judge in the District of Columbia’s federal court upheld prosecutors’ use of the same obstruction charge in a separate case against riot defenders.

To date more than 700 people have been charged with federal crimes related to the Capitol riot and at least 165 of them have pleaded guilty.",Indictment of alleged Proud Boys leaders over US Capitol attack upheld,1

More than 100 Republicans will sign a letter on Thursday declaring that if the Republican Party does not break with former President Donald Trump and change course, they will back the creation of a third party.

The letter, titled: 'A Call For American Renewal,' is an exploratory move toward forming a breakaway party, two of its organizers said.

The group, which includes former officials at both state and national level, is dismayed by what it says is a modern Republican Party driven by its allegiance to Trump, who continues to falsely claim the 2020 election was stolen from him.

'The Republican Party is broken. It's time for a resistance of the 'rationals' against the 'radicals,' said Miles Taylor, one of the organizers.

Over 100 Republican officials will sign a letter on Thursday declaring that if the Republican Party does not break with former President Donald Trump (left with one of the petition organizers Miles Taylor) and change course, they will back the creation of a third party

'The Republican Party is broken. It's time for a resistance of the 'rationals' against the 'radicals,' said Miles Taylor, one of the organizers, explaining the letter, headlined: 'A Call For American Renewal'

Taylor added: 'This is us saying that a group of more than 100 prominent Republicans think that the situation has gotten so dire with the Republican Party that it is now time to seriously consider whether an alternative might be the only option,

'I'm one of those in the group that feels very strongly that if we can't get the G.O.P. back to a rational party that supports free minds, free markets, and free people, I'm out and a lot of people are coming with me.'

The letter is timed for release just hours after House Republicans booted Rep. Liz Cheney of Wyoming from her post as the Party's No. 3 leadership position – following her own denunciation of those who put forward the 'lie' that the election was stolen from Trump.

Taylor commented Wednesday morning on Cheney's speech, delivered to colleagues in a brief floor speech Tuesday night.

'It was an extremely symbolic and powerful moment that showed exactly where the GOP stands,' Taylor told CNN.

He called her 'one of the few Republicans that still retains her spine in a sea of spinelessness.'

Among the signatories are governors, members of Congress, ambassadors, cabinet secretaries, state legislators and Republican Party chairmen.

Taylor, while serving in the Trump White House, wrote an anonymous opinion piece in the New York Times in 2018 headlined: 'I Am Part of the Resistance Inside the Trump Administration.'

The group first raised the threat in February here, following the deadly January 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol by Trump supporters to try to disrupt congressional certification of Democrat Joe Biden's presidential election victory

He declined to outline the exact changes the group will demand from the Republican Party.

The letter highlights the wide intraparty rift over Trump.

Most Republicans remain fiercely loyal to the former president.

The letter signatories, who include former ambassadors, governors, congressional members and Cabinet secretaries, want the Republican Party to return to 'principled' leadership and reject division and conspiracy theories, or face a new party dedicated to fighting for Republicans such as Cheney and against fearmongering and lies.

Backers of the reform group include former Pennsylvania Governor Tom Ridge, former New Jersey Governor Christine Todd Whitman, George W. Bush-era Transportation Secretary Mary Peters.

They may face an uphill battle in getting any current Republican officeholders to sign on - including Cheney herself, who in February rejected the idea of a third party, saying it would empower Democrats.

A spokesman for Trump, Jason Miller, said: 'These losers left the Republican Party when they voted for Joe Biden.'

Evan McMullin said if the Republican Party does not reject lies and extremism, part of it 'will have no choice but to part ways with it and build something new. We're excited about that prospect.

The letter comes as Trump loyalists have flexed their muscle in Congress even after the president's defeat and the Jan. 6th riot.

Let the fight start there.'

The new details were included in an indictment against four rioters - Joseph Hackett, 50, Jason Dolan, 40, William Isaacs, 21, and another, unnamed defendant, filed on Monday.

They are among 16 Oath Keeper members who have been charged so far. The others are Thomas Caldwell, 65, Donovan Crowl, 50, Jessica Watkins, 38, Sandra Parker, 60, Bennie Parker, 70, Graydon Young, 54, Laura Steele, 52, Kelly Meggs, 52, Connie Meggs, 59, Kenneth Harrelson, 40, Roberto Minuta, 36, Joshua James, 33, Joseph Hackett, 50.

Oath Keepers founder Stewart Rhodes has not been charged, but he was mentioned repeatedly in the newly unsealed indictment as 'Person One'. It's unclear why he has not been arrested.

Members of Oath Keepers were shown protecting Roger Stone on January 5and 6 at the Capitol

According to prosecutors, on November 9 - after the election was called for Biden -Rhodes told the men in an online GoToMeeting conference call: 'We’re going to defend the president, the duly elected president. Because if you don’t, guys, you’re going to be in a bloody, bloody civil war and a bloody...insurrection, or you can call it a war or fight.

'I’m willing to sacrifice myself for that. Let the fight start there. That will give President Trump what he needs, frankly.

'If things go kinetic, good. If they throw bombs at us and shoot us, great, because that brings the president his reason and rationale for dropping the Insurrection Act.”

'I do want some Oath Keepers to stay on the outside, and to stay fully armed and prepared to go in armed, if they have to...So our posture’s gonna be that we’re posted outside of DC, um, awaiting the President’s orders. . . . We hope he will give us the orders.

'We want him to declare an insurrection, and to call us up as the militia.'

By then, claims from Trump's camp about voter fraud were widespread and millions thought he'd been robbed of victory.

Over the coming months, members of the group allegedly plotted the attack.

Watkins is said to have recruited people in Ohio, telling them he was organizing a week-long training camp and saying: 'I need you fighting fit by inauguration.'

On November 17, when asked what his prediction was for the coming year, Watkins allegedly told a recruit: 'I can’t predict. I don’t underestimate the resolve of the Deep State.

'Biden may still yet be our President. If he is, our way of life as we know it is over. Our Republic would be over.

'Then it is our duty as Americans to fight, kill and die for our rights.'

The men who have been arrested continued to exchange texts and emails until the riot.

Rhodes encouraged them online, according to the indictment.

On January 4, he posted online: 'It is CRITICAL that all patriots who can be in DC get to DC to stand tall in support of President Trump’s fight to defeat the enemies foreign and domestic who are attempting a coup, through the massive vote fraud and related attacks on our Republic.

'We Oath Keepers are both honor-bound and eager to be there in strength to do our part.'

In another, he said: 'As we have done on all recent DC Ops, we will also have well armed and equipped QRF1 teams on standby, outside DC, in the event of a worst case scenario, where the President calls us up as part of the militia to to assist him inside DC.

'We don’t expect a need for him to call on us for that at this time, but we stand ready if he does (and we also stand ready to answer the call to serve as militia anytime in the future, and anywhere in our nation, if he does invoke the Insurrection Act).'

Despite his alleged role in organizing the men who have been charged, Rhodes has not.

He claimed in March that he and other Oath Keeper members were the victims of a conspiracy.

'I may go to jail soon, not for anything I actually did, but for made-up crimes,' he said.

This superseding indictment, part of a larger federal government criminal conspiracy case, now includes a total of 16 Oath Keepers. The other 12 co-defendants have pleaded not guilty.

Prosecutors have said in recent weeks that other members of the militia group planned to commit violence and brought firearms into the city.

The Oath Keepers accept anyone, the recent court filing notes, but 'explicitly focus on recruiting current and former military, law enforcement, and first-responder personnel.'

Senate Republicans last week voted down a House-passed bill that would create a 9/11-style commission to investigate the January 6 Capitol attack.

Democrats were unable to override a Republican filibuster placed on the bill during a Friday vote of 54 to 35, with 60 votes needed.

Republican Sens. Mitt Romney, Susan Collins, Bill Cassidy, Lisa Murkowski, Rob Portman and Ben Sasse voted alongside 48 Democrats.

The bill is now essentially dead - though Democrats may launch other investigations and some are ongoing in Senate committees.

Last month, a founding member of the far-right group Oath Keepers has pleaded guilty to two felony charges over the January 6 riot at the US Capitol.

Jon Ryan Schaffer, 53, struck a plea deal with prosecutors Friday, becoming the first person charged in relation to the attack to plead guilty.

Schaffer was initially slapped with six charges over the violent incident, but pleaded guilty to two charges as part of the deal: obstruction of an official proceeding and entering and remaining in a restricted building or grounds with a deadly or dangerous weapon.

Police said Schaffer - who hails from Indiana - was armed with bear spray when he barged into the Capitol following a 'Stop the Steal' rally held earlier in the day.

As part of the plea deal, Schaffer has agreed to cooperate with investigators - prompting rumors he may 'turn' on some of his fellow Oath Keeper members.

The NSW government led by Labor Premier Chris Minns announced yesterday it was seeking to appoint three three commissioners as part of a $5million commitment to exploring the possibilities of a treaty with Indigenous communities.

LNP Senator Price said Mr Minns was ignoring the result of last year's federal Voice referendum and instead listening to an urbanised activist class who did not reflect the wider Indigenous community.

LNP Senator Jacinta Nampijinpa Price has hit out at state premiers pursuing state-based Voices and treaties with Indigenous Australians

'Not only did Australians and particularly NSW Australians vote no to The Voice but they voted No to concepts that were attached to the Voice, that were treaty and truth,' Senator Price, who is Shadow Minister for Indigenous Australians, said.

The Indigenous Voice to Parliament, which is described as one leg of a process towards truth-telling and treaty in its foundation document, the Uluru Statement from the Heart, was rejected by over 60 per cent of voters last October.

Senator Price also pointed out that a recent vote for a Voice to the South Australian parliament only saw a 10 per cent turnout of those eligible to vote.

In the areas where the most marginalised Indigenous people live, only around 300 voted out of 2,000 eligible electors.

'Those premiers that think they know what’s best for their constituents are pushing ahead with separatism in our country,' she told Sydney radio station 2GB on Friday.

'It is dangerous, it is unhelpful and in a democratic nation such as ours, in 2024, this is going to put us backward.'

Senator Price said the poor turnout in South Australia as well as in an election to elect Victoria's First Peoples' Assembly showed that only a minority of urbanised Indigenous activists were pushing concepts such as voice and treaty.

'It’s this ridiculous notion, it’s a racist notion to say we all think the same as a race of people,' Senator Price said.

'We don’t treat any other race of people in this manner but we continue with progressive, leftist leaders to push that notion, which is a racist stereotype.

The NSW Labor government led by Premier Chris Minns is spending $5million on exploring the possibilities of signing a treaty with Indigenous people

'We know that when you stand up and call yourself a victim and you attack anyone who listens with this notion, there are those in power who will fall at your feet and give you what you want.

'Just because we are Indigenous doesn’t mean we are all marginalised. In fact only 20 per cent of the three per cent or us are marginalised and our efforts should be focused on the marginalised.'

Senator Price joined Warren Mundine, her fellow No vote campaigner at the Voice referendum, in condemning the push for Indigenous people to be exempt from land tax as well as interest on loans and university fees as part of a Victorian treaty.

'It’s absolutely outrageous. It’s more rent-seeking,' she said.

'To suggest that the rest of Victoria, non-indigenous Victoria have to put their hand in their pocket, pay their taxes so it goes towards people of a certain racial heritage and of mixed heritage, is just utterly ridiculous.

'It is separatism, it causes angst, it causes a divide within communities.'

Senator Price said that Indigenous politics was dominated by an urbanised activist class

Victorian Premier Jacinta Allan has not ruled out the race-based financial advantages being included in a treaty with the state's Indigenous population, with negotiations to be held later this year.

Prominent Indigenous Elder Aunty Jill Gallagher AO has pushed the case for an array of financial benefits the government should consider for the treaty, which also included exempting Indigenous people from stamp tax and council rates.

Appearing on Sky News, Mr Mundine labelled these demands a 'brain fart' and said they would not make a practical difference to the major issues facing Indigenous people.

On Friday Senator Price was also asked by 2GB's Mark Levy about her hometown of Alice Springs, which following a riot has seen a curfew imposed on youths.

Senator Price said this had provided some welcome respite for the crime-wracked town but she feared what would happen when the curfew is lifted next Tuesday.

'We can’t live like this long-term,' she said.

'We need to have our community back to what it used to be instead of normalising this kind of behaviour because we don’t get it anywhere else.'

She said the Indigenous Affairs Minister Linda Burney needed to step up and 'get serious with policy that is going to improve the lives of marginalised indigenous Australians'.",Jacinta Nampijinpa Price attacks state premiers over 'racist agenda' promoting treaties with Indigenous groups,1
https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jun/22/first-thing-more-rescue-equipment-fears-oxygen-levels-titan,1,"Good morning.

The search for a submersible that went missing during a dive to the wreck of the Titanic has entered its fourth day, amid concerns the oxygen supply sustaining its five passengers is running dangerously low.

Equipment from the US, Canada, UK and France is heading to the scene of the search, about 400 miles (640km) south of St John’s, Newfoundland, joining an international coalition of rescue teams that is sweeping a vast expanse of the North Atlantic for the Titan after it went missing on Sunday, nearly two hours into its dive.

Officials still hold out hope of a rescue. A US Coast Guard captain, Jamie Frederick, said on Wednesday: “When you’re in the middle of a search and rescue case, you always have hope.” Joyce Murray, Canada’s coastguard minister, echoed that sentiment. “We have to retain hope as part of what we are doing as a human community to find the explorers and bring them to safety,” she said.

The search is focused on an area where underwater sounds have been heard but their origin remains a mystery. “I can’t tell you what the noises are. What I can tell you is we’re searching where the noises are, and that’s all we can do at this point,” Frederick said, adding that recordings were being analysed by navy subsurface acoustics experts.

Is there still any oxygen left in the submarine? It is hard to know. The oxygen supply in the vessel depends largely on a range of factors, according to experts, such as the breathing rate of those onboard, their level of physical activity and whether they remain calm.

Half of Americans have faced ‘extreme’ weather in the last six weeks

View image in fullscreen A man cools off near a fountain during a heatwave in Houston, Texas, when temperatures reached 98F (37C). Photograph: Bloomberg/Getty Images

Half of the US population has faced an extreme weather alert since 1 May and many more are likely to face risks from wildfires, flooding, tropical storms and extreme heat as summer begins.

The Union of Concerned Scientists (UCS) has been tracking the alerts sent by the National Weather Service warning about dangerous weather.

The UCS also found that more than 51 million people in the US were facing extreme weather alerts on Wednesday, with about a third of them living in areas designated as disadvantaged by the federal government.

Between May and November is a period the UCS is calling “danger season”, when increasingly intense storms, heatwaves and wildfires are expected to besiege the country. Fifty per cent “is a very troubling sort of threshold that we’ve crossed,” said Juan Declet-Barreto, a senior social scientist for climate vulnerability at UCS. “And we are one month and a half into danger season.”

How is the extreme weather linked to the climate crisis? About 10% of the extreme heat alerts this year have a clear “climate signal” linking them to the crisis, said Declet-Barreto. That figure is based on the non-profit Climate Central’s Climate Shift Index, which estimates the influence of climate change on extreme temperatures around the world. In Texas, the heat was made at least three, four and five times as likely by climate breakdown, the index indicates.

Invasion of giant African land snails prompts quarantine in south Florida

An invasion of giant African land snails has alarmed people in south Florida, where authorities have established a quarantine area to try to deal with the destructive pests.

The invasive snails have voracious appetites and consume at least 500 species of plants, according to Florida’s agriculture department, which is fearful for the state’s lucrative growing industries of citrus and other fruits and vegetables.

It has set up a “treatment area” covering several dozen blocks of the city of Miramar, south-west of Fort Lauderdale, and is warning people that the snails pose a serious health risk to humans by carrying the parasite rat lungworm, known to cause meningitis.

Under the quarantine order, the department says it is unlawful “to move a giant African land snail or a regulated article, including, but not limited to, plants, plant parts, plants in soil, soil, yard waste, debris, compost or building materials”.

Why are they such a problem? The snails are illegal to import or possess in the US without a permit, and authorities have been trying for years to eradicate them. They can damage buildings as well as destroying crops, but are considered a delicacy by some.

When the supreme court struck down the nationwide right to abortion, Jana, a 24-year-old aspiring lawyer, saw warnings across her social media feeds that period tracker apps were sharing her data, and could be used as evidence if the user was suspected of having an illegal abortion. Jana deleted the apps. A few months later, around the end of November 2022, Jana found she was pregnant. She managed to get an abortion but quickly realized she would have to go back on birth control. It was the last thing she wanted to do after facing anxiety and depression, which were exacerbated by the hormonal contraception, but she felt she had no choice. Jana is not alone in feeling backed into a corner by the supreme court’s Dobbs v Jackson Women’s Health Organization decision. Within a month of the ruling, in July 2022, a Time survey found 21% of respondents reported changing their method of birth control after Roe was overturned.

Climate check: Senate examines role of ‘dark money’ in delaying climate action

The Senate budget committee held a hearing yesterday morning to scrutinize the role of oil- and gas-linked “dark money” in delaying climate action – and tearing through local and federal budgets. The hearing was led by Senator Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island, who has held 10 climate crisis-focused hearings since he took the helm of the budget committee this past February. It follows an inquiry launched by House Democrats in 2021, which focused on big oil’s alleged efforts to mislead the public about the climate crisis. “I am shining a light on the massive, well-documented economic risks of climate change,” said Whitehouse, who has also given nearly 300 speeches about the climate crisis on the Senate floor. “These are risks that have the potential to cascade across our entire economy and trigger widespread financial hardship and calamity.”

Last Thing: workplace sins – US restaurant used fake priest in ‘shameless’ wage theft scheme

A northern California restaurant chain will have to pay more than $140,000 in back pay after it ran a “shameless” wage theft scheme that involved a fake priest who had workers confess to any sins they committed while on the clock. The owners and operators of Taqueria Garibaldi, a Sacramento-based restaurant chain, are also accused of threatening workers and fabricating timesheets as part of an effort to obstruct an investigation into the business. In what the labor department described as “among the most shameless” efforts to intimidate workers that investigators have seen, the owners of Garibaldi also brought in a fake priest to conduct confession sessions with employees. Once employees sat with the “priest” they were peppered with work-specific questions and asked whether they had any ill feelings toward their employers or had spoken negatively about them to anyone, including investigators.

https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/27/hong-kong-trump-china-security-crackdown-protests,1,"Hong Kong police arrested at least 360 people during day-long protests and skirmishes across the city, as residents railed against controversial legislation aimed at bringing the territory further under Beijing’s control.

Police fired pepper-spray bullets into lunchtime crowds as people shouted slogans. Officers stopped and searched residents, including students, and rounded up suspected protesters, forcing them to sit in rows on the ground.

Thousands of armed police had flooded the streets to stop the planned demonstrations aimed at halting a law criminalising ridicule of China’s national anthem. The protests have been given a fresh urgency with Beijing announcing last week plans to force a sweeping anti-sedition law on Hong Kong, where similar legislation was shelved after it caused mass protests in 2003.

The National People’s Congress, China’s rubber-stamp parliament, is expected to approve the plan on Thursday, bypassing Hong Kong’s own legislature.

Protesters occupied the roads in Mongkok into the night after a day of protests and clashes. Police said that as of 9.30pm, over 360 people had been arrested for offences including unauthorised assembly and possession of objects such as petrol bombs.



Earlier in the day, police in riot gear stopped and searched mainly young people outside Hong Kong’s MTR railway stations during morning rush hour and lined walkways as commuters shuffled past, prompting accusations on social media that the city had become “a police state”.

Roads around the Legislative Council building (LegCo) were blocked off as lawmakers held a debate on the anthem law..

Protest organisers on social media urged people to “be water” and keep moving throughout the city, but acknowledged it would be difficult to stop the anthem debate without high risk of arrest. “But you can at least make a statement,” said one post.

Crowds regrouped from lunchtime. Schoolchildren were among those detained in Mongkok, while at least 180 were arrested in Causeway Bay for an unauthorised gatherings and protesters repeatedly charged at in Central and fired at with pepper-spray rounds.

Police accused protesters of setting fire to debris and throwing objects at officers. “Police had no other option and needed to employ minimal force, including pepper balls to prevent the relevant illegal and violent behaviour,” the force said.

The crowds remained, swearing at police and chanting: “Hong Kong independence, it’s the only way.”

“I’ve come for something I care deeply about – ultimately it’s freedom,” said a 40-year-old lawyer who wished to remain anonymous, citing the national security laws, Beijing encroachment, and a recent report clearing police of wrongdoing. “If we keep quiet, they can get away with it. I don’t think we can change things but need to make sure our voices are heard.”

“Of course I need to make my voice heard. They’re forcing this upon us and we can’t fight against them,” said Mrs Lam, 74.

A 73-year-old woman who gave the surname Cheung said she swam to Hong Kong from China to “escape the dictatorial rule of the CCP [Chinese Communist party]” when she was 15. “The Communist party is not trustworthy,” she said. “When they say you’re guilty then you’re guilty. Is there still ‘one country, two systems’? Of course we need to fight.”

A district councillor, Roy Tam, said police had pointed pepper-spray at him. “Police use force to intimidate people to disperse gatherings,” he said. “Freedom of assembly has gone.”

Several days have been set aside in the Hong Kong legislature for debate on the anthem law and the vote is scheduled for 4 June – the anniversary of the Tiananmen Square massacre and another source of controversy given Hong Kong’s vigil this year will not be allowed.

Opponents say the anthem law could be weaponised against pro-democracy activists and legislators since “intent to insult” the anthem, such as by changing lyrics or music or singing in a “disrespectful way”, carries financial penalties and jail of up to three years.

Booing of the March of the Volunteers, the national anthem of the People’s Republic of China, as well as Hong Kong and Macau, at Hong Kong football marches has previously embarrassed Beijing.

Macau enacted an anthem law in January 2019, but Hong Kong’s stalled amid political gridlock which later descended to violence. The government has denied the bill would suppress freedom of speech, and said an offence would occur only if someone expressed their views by publicly and intentionally insulted the national anthem.

Hong Kong media on Wednesday alsl reported that Beijing had expanded the scope of the draft security law legislation to target organisations as well as individuals, according to the public broadcaster RTHK and the South China Morning Post.

The proposed law has attracted criticism from across the world. The US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, on Wednesday set the stage for the US to withdraw Hong Kong’s preferential trade and financial status as he notified Congress that the Trump administration no longer regards it as autonomous from mainland China. The EU has said China must respect Hong Kong’s autonomy.

Taiwan’s president, Tsai Ing-wen, has said her government would come up with measures to help Hong Kong residents, fearing for their safety under the new law, relocate to Taiwan.

A Chinese foreign ministry spokesman, Zhao Lijian, said on Wednesday afternoon that his country would take “all necessary countermeasures” against foreign interference.

The commander of the People’s Liberation Army garrison in Hong Kong said earlier this week his troops – estimated to number around 10,000 – stood ready to “safeguard” Chinese sovereignty and support national security laws.",Hong Kong crisis: at least 360 arrested as China protests grow,1
https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/nov/18/oath-keepers-trial-closing-arguments-capitol-attack,1,"For weeks leading up to 6 January 2021, the Oath Keepers founder Stewart Rhodes and four associates of the far-right group discussed using violence to overturn the 2020 presidential election’s outcome, and when rioters started storming the US Capitol they saw an opportunity to do it, a federal prosecutor told jurors on Friday as the seditious conspiracy case wound toward a close.

Prosecutor Kathryn Rakoczy said in her closing argument to jurors after nearly two months of testimony in the high-stakes case that Rhodes’s own words show he was preparing to lead a rebellion to keep Democrat Joe Biden out of the White House. Rhodes and his co-defendants repeatedly called for “violent overthrow” of the US government and sprang into action that day, she said.

“Our democracy is fragile,” Rakoczy said. “It cannot exist without the rule of law, and it will not survive if people dissatisfied with the results of an election can use force and violence to change the outcome.”

The closing arguments began in Washington federal court after the final pieces of evidence were presented in the trial alleging Rhodes and his band of anti-government extremists plotted for weeks to interrupt the peaceful transfer of power from Republican Donald Trump to Biden.

Rhodes’s attorney sought to downplay his violent rhetoric in the run-up to January 6, describing it as “venting” and insisting there was no agreement or conspiracy. Defense attorney James Lee Bright said Rhodes’s language was focused on persuading Trump to invoke the Insurrection Act over what he saw as a stolen election.

Rhodes “wasn’t hiding his opinions, he wasn’t hiding any plans”, Bright told jurors. He was “as open as daylight with every plan on what he was asking President Trump to do”.

Evidence presented by prosecutors shows Rhodes and his co-defendants discussing the prospect of violence and the need to keep Biden out of the White House in the weeks leading up to January 6, before stashing a cache of weapons referred to as a “quick reaction force” at a Virginia hotel across the Potomac River.

On January 6, Oath Keepers wearing helmets and other battle gear were seen pushing through the pro-Trump mob there and into the Capitol. Rhodes remained outside, like “a general surveying his troops on a battlefield”, a prosecutor told jurors. After the attack, prosecutors said, Rhodes and other Oath Keepers celebrated with dinner at a local restaurant.

Defense attorneys have spent weeks hammering prosecutors’ relative lack of evidence that the Oath Keepers had an explicit plan to attack the Capitol. Rhodes, who is from Texas, testified that he and his followers were only in Washington to provide security for rightwing figures including Roger Stone. Those Oath Keepers who did enter the Capitol went rogue and were “stupid”, he said.

Rhodes testified that the mountain of writings and text messages showing him rallying his band of extremists to prepare for violence and discussing the prospect of a “bloody” civil war ahead of January 6 was only bombastic talk.

The prosecutor sought to rebut suggestions that Rhodes’s rhetoric was simply bluster, telling jurors that his messages weren’t “ranting and raving” but were “deadly serious”.

“The way they have appointed themselves to be above the law is why they are here today,” she said. “The sense of entitlement that led to frustration followed by rage and then violence – that is the story of this conspiracy.”

Rhodes’s lawyer said his client was back at a hotel room eating chicken wings and watching TV when the first rioters started storming the Capitol. He noted that the Oath Keepers never deployed their “quick reaction force” arsenal.

“You’re either the Keystone Cops of insurrectionists, or there is no insurrection,” he told jurors, referring to the inept police officers of silent movies.

Two other defendants testified in the case. Jessica Watkins, of Woodstock, Ohio, echoed that her actions that day were “really stupid” but maintained she was not part of a plan and was “swept along” with the mob, which she likened to a crowd gathered at a store for a sale on the popular shopping day known as Black Friday.

Defendant Thomas Caldwell, a navy veteran from Virginia, downplayed a chilling piece of evidence: messages he sent trying to get a boat to ferry weapons from Virginia across the Potomac into Washington. He testified that he was never serious about his queries, though he struggled to explain other messages referencing violence on January 6.

Two other defendants, Kelly Meggs and Kenneth Harrelson, both from Florida, did not testify. Meggs’s attorney Stanley Woodward argued that there were thousands of people involved, and his client was not among the first people to enter the Capitol.

Defense attorneys’ closing statements are expected to continue on Monday.

The group is the first among hundreds of people arrested in the deadly Capitol riot to stand trial on seditious conspiracy, a rare civil war-era charge that calls for up to 20 years behind bars upon conviction. The justice department last secured such a conviction at trial nearly 30 years ago and intends to try two more groups on the charge later this year.","Oath Keepers called for ‘violent overthrow’ of US government, trial hears",1

Barnett, who proudly referred to himself as a white nationalist on social media, was charged with unlawful entry. He was taken into custody at his home in Little Rock, Arkansas. It's unclear where he now is or if he'll be extradited but he is in custody.

He has been charged with knowingly entering or remaining in any restricted building or grounds without lawful entry; violent entry and disorderly conduct on Capitol grounds; and theft of public money, property, or records.

Lonnie Coffman, 70, has also been arrested after police found his red GMC pick-up truck near the RNC - where a pipe bomb was left. He has not been charged over the pipe bomb but cops found two handguns, 11 Molotov cocktails and an M4 carbine assault rifle in his vehicle.

He has been charged with possession an unregistered firearm (destructive device) and carrying a pistol without a license.

Dozens more remain free and the FBI is scrambling to catch them with public appeals for help and rewards for information after Wednesday's disastrous attempts by law enforcement to control the crowd.

Their failure to arrest the rioters - many of whom had guns and overpowered them - has outraged millions of Americans who compared the soft touch to the harsh crackdown by police on BLM protesters during the summer.

The cops found Coffman's vehicle and searched it after securing a perimeter in the area surrounding the DNC and RNC, where two pipe bombs had been left.

The bomb squad had been called in to help with that.

It was during a sweep of the area that they found Coffman's van.

'One black handgun was recovered from the right front passenger seat of the vehicle.

'After locating the black handgun, officers proceeded to search the rest of the pickup truck, including the bed of the truck, which was secured under a fabric top.

'During the search of the cab of the truck, officers recovered, among other things, one M4 Carbine assault rifle along with rifle magazines loaded with ammunition,' the affidavit supporting his arrest says.

Coffman was arrested after approaching cops in a female friend's car, asking if he could access his vehicle again.

He asked them: 'Did find the bombs?' which the cops thought was a reference to the materials in his car but he says was in reference to those left outside the DNC and RNC.

The cop who Leffingwell is accused of punching signed his arrest affidavit.

In it, he describes how he attacked him in the Captiol building.

'In the course of this effort and while inside the Capitol building, I encountered an adult male who later identified himself to me as Mark Jefferson Leffingwell.

'Leffingwell attempted to push past me and other officers.

'When he was deterred from advancing further into the building, Leffingwell punched me repeatedly with a closed fist.

'I was struck in the helmet that I was wearing and in the chest.

'Working with other officers, I was able to gain control over Leffingwell, who attempted to struggle while being detained.

'I transported Leffingwell to United States Capitol Police headquarters for processing,' the cop, Daniel Amendola, wrote.

'While pushing Alberts towards the line, I tapped the bulge with my baton and felt a hard object that I immediately recognized to be a firearm. At the time, Alberts was also wearing a bullet-proof vest and carrying a backpack,' officer Dallan Haynes wrote.

Pruitt was among a group of people who refused to leave the Capitol after the 6pm curfew. Council was among the group that pushed a barricade down to get into the building.

Cindy Fitchett, Michael Curzio, Douglas Sweet, Terry Brown, Bradley Rukstales, and Thomas Gallgher are charged in the same complaint for refusing to leave.

31 May 2020 23.21 BST Poverty in the occupied West Bank may double as Palestinians are slammed by the economic fallout of the coronavirus pandemic, the World Bank has warned. The Palestinian territories have seen low infection rates after acting quickly to curtail the spread of Covid-19, with three deaths out of 450 cases registered among some five million residents in Gaza and the West Bank, AFP reports. But the Palestinian Authority’s financial situation is “expected to become increasingly difficult” due to loss of income and increased spending on healthcare and other areas, the World Bank said in a report.

Photograph: Abed Al Hashlamoun/EPA The fallout is expected to see the number of households living below the poverty line increase this year from 14 to 30% in the West Bank, largely due to Palestinians being unable to cross into Israel for work. The Palestinian Authority last week announced an end to the lockdown it had imposed in early March across the West Bank after an outbreak of the Covid-19 illness in the biblical city of Bethlehem. The easing allowed more than 63,000 Palestinians to pass through checkpoints for work on Sunday, according to the Israeli military branch handling civilian affairs in the occupied Palestinian territories. The borders of the Hamas-run Gaza Strip, which has been under a crippling Israeli blockade since 2007, remain closed to all but a few returning Gazans, who are quarantined on arrival. The poverty rate was already 53% in Gaza before the pandemic and the World Bank forecast it would jump to 64% this year. Overall, the Palestinian economy is set to shrink between 7.6 and 11%, the global body said, a severe downturn after one percent growth in 2019. Share Updated at 23.29 BST

The two governments released a joint announcement just days after the WHO suspended testing it on Covid-19 patients due to health concerns. Both presidents have promoted its use, despite the US Food and Drug Administration issuing a warning about its use against the virus. “The American and Brazilian people stand in solidarity in the fight against the coronavirus,” the statement said. “We are announcing the United States Government has delivered two million doses of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) to the people of Brazil. “HCQ will be used as a prophylactic to help defend Brazil’s nurses, doctors and healthcare professionals against the virus. It will also be used as a therapeutic to treat Brazilians who become infected.

31 May 2020 21.51 BST Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro joined a rally on Sunday on horseback as supporters called for the Supreme Court to be shut down for investigating the right-wing leader, as one of its justices compared the risks to Brazil’s democracy with Hitler’s Germany. Deepening a political crisis during one of the world’s worst coronavirus outbreaks, Bolsonaro has slammed the top court for investigating his interference in police affairs and opening an inquiry into his supporters’ alleged libel and intimidation campaigns on social media. He has denounced the investigations, suggesting “absurd orders” should not be followed and warning that the court may “plunge Brazil into a political crisis.” View image in fullscreen Brazil’s president Jair Bolsonaro rides a horse during a meeting with supporters protesting in his favour, amid the coronavirus outbreak, in Brasilia, Brazil on 31 May. Photograph: Ueslei Marcelino/Reuters Supreme Court Justice Celso de Mello, who is responsible for investigating a former justice minister’s allegation that Bolsonaro tried to meddle with law enforcement for personal reasons, said the president’s supporters were seeking a military dictatorship. “We must resist the destruction of the democratic order to avoid what happened in the Weimar Republic when Hitler, after he was elected by popular vote ... did not hesitate annulling the constitution and imposing a totalitarian system in 1933,” de Mello told other judges in a message seen by Reuters and reported in Brazilian newspapers. Bolsonaro has said his aims are democratic and accused his opponents of going against the constitution. On Saturday night, a group of masked backers of Bolsonaro marched to the court carrying torches to call for its closure. During Sunday’s demonstrations in Sao Paulo, opponents of Bolsonaro took to a main avenue to protest against “fascism” and clashed with riot police who intervened, using tear gas, to stop them getting close to a rally by supporters of the president.

31 May 2020 20.35 BST While the rest of India prepares to reopen, individual states are identifying high-risk zones where lockdowns will stay in place. Prime minister Narendra Modi’s government has extended lockdown until 30 June in these ‘containment’ zones that continue to report high infection numbers. Outside the zones, restaurants, malls and religious buildings will be allowed to reopen from 8 June, in a relaxation of the world’s longest coronavirus lockdown. The number of cases confirmed in India has reached a daily record high during the past 48 hours, and critics argue Modi is leaving the responsibility of dealing with the virus up to individual states. In India’s most populous state, Uttar Pradesh, 1,111 zones have been identified, while in Gujarat over 400,000 houses were marked as high-risk zones. Officials in the western state of Maharastra said all markets, except malls and congested spaces, will be allowed to function in a staggered manner. The eastern state of West Bengal identified 285 containment zones in its capital, Kolkata. India has reported 182,000 confirmed cases, with 5,164 deaths.

The plan for grades 7 and 12, the last years of primary and secondary school respectively, to return on Monday were scrapped following teachers’ unions and governing associations urging school staff to defy the government order, saying schools did not have protective equipment to keep educators and pupils safe. Many of South Africa’s state schools are in poor condition, especially in rural areas, and analysts say that a quarter of them have no running water, making hand-washing nearly impossible.

On Monday schools will reopen only for management teams, teachers and non-teaching staff for instruction on health and safety measures, to finish cleaning and focus on supply chain matters.

The woman – who has not been identified – was the sixth person in a week to perish in such horrific circumstances.

She was reportedly of Sudanese origin and was among 86 people who set off from a beach near Calais in the early hours of this morning.

'A mayday call was made soon after midnight, but at first those on board did not want to be rescued,' said a French emergency services source.

'Navy personnel aboard the patrol board Cormoran rescued five people from the sea to begin with, but people still on board the deflating dinghy were also in a lot of trouble.

'There was an inanimate person among them, and efforts were made to revive her, but she was soon declared dead.

'The boat was massively overloaded, and sea conditions were very choppy.'

A criminal enquiry was opened last Friday after four UK-bound migrants without lifejackets drowned when their overcrowded inflatable capsized off Boulogne-Sur-Mer, 20 miles southwest of Calais.

Another person drowned off Gravelines, near Dunkirk, just two days ago too, after setting off from the beach there.

Prosecutors believe the 'poor quality, under-powered' craft used in all cases were organised by people smugglers charging around £1000-a-head.

The latest death means that 22 people have died this year alone while trying to reach the coast of England to claim asylum.

It comes two days after a UK border force ship returned people to France for the first time.

It emerged yesterday that British and French teams cooperated to rescue a group of migrants off the coast of Gravelines, northern France on Wednesday.

Patrols discovered people in the water, sparking a rescue operation aided by the British Border Force and RNLI.

Some 59 people were brought on board the French ship PSP Cormoran, including an unconscious person who could not be resuscitated by the medical team.

A British vessel, the Border Force Ranger, also saved 13 people from the water, and both ships took the group of people to Calais.

It is believed to be the first time that a British vessel has picked up migrants in French waters and been asked to return them to France.

However, government sources told MailOnline there is 'no change of policy or approach' and it was 'just the way the operation played out'.

A Maritime and Coastguard Agency spokeswoman said: 'HM Coastguard received a report of a small boat in difficulty in French waters near Calais at about 2.40pm on July 17.

'A Border Force vessel and RNLI lifeboat were sent to support French vessels in the operation, co-ordinated by French authorities.'

The year to date has been the busiest for crossings so far, with 14,759 migrants arriving between January 1 and July 16 - the most recent date for which figures are available. This compares to 14,622 in 2022, the second busiest year

The French coastguard added that it continued to search the scene until nightfall and no further people were found in the water.

One Home Office source said: 'There is ongoing cooperation on these kinds of rescue missions and consideration of where people are taken back to is generally based on conditions at sea and welfare of those who have been in the water.

'There's no change of policy or approach so it's just the way the operation played out.'

Last Friday, four people were reported killed after a packed boat carrying asylum seekers capsized at 4.30am off the coast of Boulogne sur Mer, in northern France.

More than 12,000 people have made the Channel crossing so far this year, according to Home Office provisional figures released in mid-June.

The figure was 18 percent higher than for the equivalent point last year, when 10,472 people had made the crossing.",UK-bound migrant dies when her overcrowded boat deflates - the sixth person to lose their life in the Channel this week,1

On Tuesday night in Southport, a mob threw bricks at a mosque — even though there has never been a shred of genuine evidence to suggest the perpetrator is a Muslim — and 53 police officers were injured in the fracas.

Then, on Wednesday night, the so-called 'Enough Is Enough' protests outside Downing Street resulted in 100 arrests amid calls to 'save our kids'.

Riot police, including those with dogs, were deployed in Hartlepool, County Durham, while separate demonstrations have taken place as far afield as Manchester and Aldershot, Hampshire. Further events are expected this weekend.

The right to protest is paramount in our democracy. But Britain feels on the cusp of serious disorder. Why do increasing numbers of people seem only too eager to take to the streets to make their views public?

On Tuesday night in Southport, a mob threw bricks at a mosque - even though there has never been a shred of genuine evidence to suggest the perpetrator is a Muslim - and 53 police officers were injured in the fracas

Whatever Sir Keir Starmer might like to think, most are not necessarily 'far-Right': instead, many will have legitimate concerns about mass migration, the breakdown in law and order and what they see as 'two-tier' policing, whereby some protesters are treated more leniently by the authorities than others.

They want to protect their families, their communities and their nation. Millions probably agree with them, even if they would never attend a protest, still less take part in a riot.

Southport, after all, is only the most appalling recent example of violence carried out on our shores.

On Tuesday, masked young men slashed at each other with machetes on the seafront in Southend, Essex.

Dozens, perhaps hundreds, of people ran away screaming — while officers were filmed standing by, seemingly doing nothing to stop what could easily have descended into a bloodbath. In the end, eight people were arrested and several weapons were seized.

Also this week, in a park in genteel Ipswich, Suffolk, a man in his 20s was left with 'potentially life-changing' injuries after being stabbed, while a bus driver in his 50s was stabbed to death on his way home from work in north London.

These last two incidents raised barely a squeak in the national media, so inured have we become to violence that used to be so rare here. For as long as these attacks keep proliferating, many ordinary people will grow increasingly angry. Some will be willing to take the law into their own hands.

What, then, should the authorities be doing to stop the mob from spiralling out of control?

The answer is that they should be candid with the public about the facts of specific cases.

Southport is a case in point. In the immediate aftermath of the carnage, the police and Home Office were reluctant to release any concrete information about the killer, except hurriedly to assure the public that this was not a terrorist attack (how did they know so quickly?) and to stress that a 17-year-old male born in Cardiff had been arrested.

Floral tributes left at the scene of the attack where three children were murdered and others injured

It was not until much later that more information about this young man's family background belatedly emerged.

We learned his parents had moved to Britain from Rwanda, while only on Thursday was the alleged child murderer finally named — as Axel Rudakubana.

In the absence of genuine information about this massacre of the innocents, social media — whipped up by bad-faith actors both here and abroad — inevitably stepped in. Within hours, baseless rumours began circulating online that the culprit was an illegal Muslim immigrant from the Middle East — an Arabic-sounding name was bandied about — who had arrived in the UK on a small boat from France and was 'known to MI6'.

According to academic Marc Owen Jones, there were at least 27 million views of posts on X/Twitter 'stating or speculating that the attacker was Muslim, a migrant, refugee or foreigner'.

Elon Musk's social media giant has become a sewer of disinformation recently, even as Musk himself has repeatedly criticised the accuracy of the 'mainstream media' — which he has apparently suggested 'brainwashes' people.

Unhappily for him, an EU study last year found that more fake news was carried on the platform than on five comparable sites, including TikTok, Facebook and Instagram. Twitter has proved a perfect platform for professional troublemakers, such as the misogynistic alleged pimp Andrew Tate and the rabble-rousing agitator known as 'Tommy Robinson', to weaponise public discontent.

Southport, after all, is only the most appalling recent example of violence carried out on our shores, writes Dr Rakib Ehsan

Other accounts on the site spread openly racist 'memes', many with millions of views, and often without censure.

No surprise, then, that the Southport rioters attacked a mosque on Tuesday night. They might not have done so if they had understood that the suspected perpetrator reportedly came from a Christian family.

The second thing the authorities can do to win back ordinary people who are appalled at the direction Britain seems to be taking is to avoid any suspicion of a 'two-tier' approach to the law.

After the Southport attacks, the police cracked down hard on protesters there and in London, while Home Secretary Yvette Cooper issued a statement bristling with rage and condemnation.

But when intimidating protests took place outside Rochdale police station in Lancashire as recently as last week, fuelled by social media footage of police action during arrests of young British men of Pakistani heritage at Manchester Airport, Labour ministers were swift to insist they understood the Muslim community's anger.

Senior police and BBC journalists appeared anxious to underplay the critical fact that the arrests came after a shocking brawl, in which several officers had been hospitalised — one a woman who suffered a broken nose.

A similar trend was seen two weeks ago in the Harehills area of Leeds in the ugly aftermath of social services removing children from a Roma family. Officers were pelted with missiles and saw one of their cars flipped over. A double-decker bus was set ablaze.

Yet police were filmed running away from the disorder.

To appear to treat some groups of protesters differently from others is a recipe for division and disaster. Playing favourites flouts the rule of law.

The third factor increasing public anger is, I would suggest, the behaviour of major news providers — especially the BBC, which has repeatedly disgraced itself this week.

Anchorwoman Samantha Simmonds informed viewers: 'Mass stabbings in this country are extremely rare' — a highly misleading claim.

Just this decade, Britain has suffered multiple mass stabbings, from last year's Nottingham attacks, in which two young students and a 65-year-old man were killed, to the June 2020 Islamist massacre in Reading, which saw three gay men hacked to death.

In April 2022, four people were stabbed and killed at a property in Bermondsey, South London.

Between March 2023 and March 2024 alone, 233 people were stabbed to death in England and Wales, according to the Office for National Statistics — while nearly 3,900 people were admitted to hospital with knife wounds.

Instead of openly citing this important data, BBC home affairs correspondent Daniel Sandford responded to Simmonds by comparing the Southport slaughter to what he grotesquely called the 'infamous mass stabbing in Dunblane in 1996'.

I hardly need to remind you that 16 children and their teacher were of course shot dead — not stabbed — while another 15 were wounded on that terrible day 28 years ago.

I have not seen any evidence that the BBC, or Sandford himself, have apologised for this mistake.

Could it be that the Corporation was so quick to reference Dunblane, however inappropriate, because its perpetrator was white and Scottish?

Terrified at the simmering forces of anger and alienation in the country, our leaders, our police and our state media remain unwilling to address matters openly. This reticence — however well-intentioned — has only served to deepen people's distrust.

Left unchecked, I fear it is leading us to a very dark place.

The legendary actor’s son Loewy, 28, is accused of interfering with a peace officer and disorderly conduct in the second degree.

He is among 27 arrested at the demonstration, where Black Lives Matter activists and Antifa members gathered outside the offices of the Portland police union to protest police brutality and racial inequality.

A Portland Police Department (PPD) press release listed Loewy’s name along with the others arrested after the protest was declared an unlawful assembly by the city and officers in riot gear rushed the crowd, detonating a smoke grenade and firing pepper balls and rubber bullets on the activists.

Loewy lives in the Oregon city and works as a Junior Software Engineer at tech firm Chainstarters Inc.

The 28-year-old appears to lean further left on the political spectrum than his Hollywood star father, who previously voiced his support for the Iraq war and once said in support of the death penalty: ‘I would have no problem pushing the switch while having dinner.’

But in May, 66-year-old Malkovich told The Guardian the last time he voted in a presidential election was for Democrat George McGovern in 1972.

Multiple warnings were given to disperse with the threat of crowd control munitions and arrest

Loewy’s sister, Amandine, is living a quieter life during quarantine – at home with her parents in Cambridge, Massachusetts and working in a grocery store, according to the interview the actor gave the paper.

The protest was attended by around 300 people, who marched from a local park to the Portland Police Association office east of the city.

Many wore gas masks, helmets and body armor in anticipation of violent clashes with police.

But apart from expletive-ridden chants and abuse hurled at the state police lining the outside of the building, the gathering remained largely peaceful until police moved in on the crowd at 11.45pm to break up the demonstration and clear the road.

'[It was] total chaos with pepper spray, bottles thrown and cops chasing people.'

The police were accused of being heavy handed from the very start as officers in riot gear were seen marching into the public space to tell those gathered there to leave.

The park previously closed at midnight, but widespread drug taking, partying and other anti-social behavior led to complaints from well-heeled residents in the upmarket area, with Mayor Bill de Blasio announcing the curfew in response to the crisis last week.

At one point a shirtless man threatened riot-clad officers with a broken bottle before attempting to throw a metal gate at law enforcement. He was subsequently arrested.

'Cops at every entrance now, students, random people partying, unhoused folks, and other random folks are still being attacked in the edge of the park,' he added.

Several police cars entered the park from different sides announcing over their speakers that the park was closed and that people still inside had to leave - or face arrest.

Those who decided to remain had to be forcibly remove by police before metal barricades were pulled across the entrances to the park in order to keep others out.

'Hell no! We won't go!' some chanted as police said the park was closed.

The park was originally shut down at the relatively early hour of 10pm last weekend after a neighborhood organization complained of noise, left over trash in the morning and parties that ran late into the night.

Crowds of rowdy people have been hanging out in the park until the early hours of the morning with loud music and anti-social behavior.

Later statements also alluded to 'crimes' that were occurring within the park's boundaries.

'A lot of community residents have expressed concerns. Parks historically have had a closing time. This is an effort to make sure there is real respect for community concerns about noise and safety,' said Mayor Bill de Blasio earlier in the week.

NYPD and the parks department have said the earlier curfew will be in place indefinitely.​

Some park-goers claimed the reported issues were overblown, and moaned about the new closing time.

'I think the curfew is stupid,' Wayne Evans said to NY1. 'I come here often at night, and I stay late, I stay until 1, 2 o'clock in the morning and people are just out here having fun. There's no funny business.'

'That's ridiculous and it's summer time, too,' Omar Nurridin said. 'I don't think they're going to really do a good job of enforcing that, or it's a setup to give people a bunch of tickets.'

Crime in the 6th Precinct is up 62 percent in the last year, and now activities like drug use and prostitution plague the park, causing it to shut down on Friday, Saturday, and Sunday nights at 10, two hours earlier than the usual midnight closure.

Many New Yorkers will likely support the Washington Square Park crackdown, amid fears the city is sliding back to the crime-ridden 'bad old days' of the 1970s and 1980s.

Figures from the NYPD's Compstate website show serious crime rose by 23.4 per cent in May, compared to the same month last year.

Robberies rocketed to 1,082 over the 28 days to May 30, up from just 726 for the same period in 2020.

Felony assaults also soared over by 22.6 per cent the same period, from 1,443 in May 2020, to 1,769 in May 2021.

Mayor de Blasio has repeatedly been accused of being 'pro-criminal' by critics. They say his bail reforms - intended to avoid leaving people who can't afford bail languishing in jail for months or years for petty crimes - releases suspects back onto the streets to go on to reoffend.

Morale among the NYPD has slumped amid lukewarm support from de Blasio. Crime on the city's transit network - including its buses, subways and trains - doubled in May compared to May 2020, up from 78 last year to 154 this year.",Multiple arrested as NYPD use pepper spray and mob protesting curfew throw glass bottles in NYC park,1

The footage shows Luke Denman, 34, and Airan Berry, 41, being led from a fishing boat alongside six Venezuelan mercenaries and being forced to lie on the ground at gunpoint.

The coup was coordinated by an ex-Green Beret named Jordan Goudreau, 43, who says the objective was to capture Maduro. Goudreau claims to have built a force of 300 men, reportedly backed by US billionaires.

President Maduro called the arrested men 'terrorist mercenaries’ and blamed the attacks on the Trump administration, Venezuela's opposition leader Juan Guaidó and neighboring Colombia, all of which have denied involvement. The U.S. has backed Guaidó as the country's leader.

On Tuesday, President Donald Trump denied any involvement by the U.S. government.

'We'll find out. We just heard about it,' Trump said when asked about the incident and the Americans' arrests. 'But it has nothing to do with our government.'

During the press conference late Monday, President Maduro showed images of the fishing boats the alleged attackers used and equipment like walkie-talkies and night-vision glasses collected in what he called an 'intense' couple of days.

'The United States government is fully and completely involved in this defeated raid,' Maduro said, praising members of a fishing village for cornering one group in the sweep netting the 'professional American mercenaries.'

The United States has led a campaign to oust Maduro, increasing pressure in recent weeks by indicting the socialist leader as a narco-trafficker and offering a $15 million reward for his arrest.

Speaking about the two U.S. citizens that have been captured, he said: 'They were playing Rambo. They were playing hero,' adding that Venezuelan authorities had caught wind of the plot before its execution.

Six other Venezuelans were arrested alongside the American citizens, CNN reports.

Maduro ally and Attorney General Tarek William Saab said that in total they've arrested 114 people suspected in the attempted attack and they are on the hunt of 92 others.

According to his social media accounts, Airan Berry served as a Sergeant First Class in the U.S. military from 1996 and 2013. He is listed as having attended school in Texas.

On Monday, Maduro accused Florida-based ex-Green Beret Goudreau of leading the incursion 'with terrorist mercenaries trained in Colombia to assault Venezuela and try to kill me'.

Goudreau said earlier on Monday that he was working with the two men in a mission intended to detain Maduro and 'liberate' Venezuela.

Goudreau is a former associate of Keith Schiller, Donald Trump's bodyguard. Schiller accompanied Goudreau to a meeting last May to discuss security with representatives of Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaidó. Afterwards, Schiller claims he cut contact with Goudreau.

A shadowy group of US billionaires led by Roen Kraft, an eccentric descendant of the cheese-making family, promised support for the 'private coup' and also met with Schiller and Goudreau, two businessmen he dealt with told the Associated Press.

According to an AP report, Kraft allegedly lured prospective donors with the promise of preferential access to negotiate deals in the energy and mining sectors with an eventual Guaidó government, one of the businessmen told AP.

He provided a two-page, unsigned draft memorandum for a six-figure commitment he said was sent by Kraft in October in which he represents himself as the 'prime contractor' of Venezuela.

Before dawn on Sunday, officials say the first attack started on a beach near Venezuela's port city of La Guaira, when security forces made the first two arrests and killed eight others attempting to make a landing by speedboats.

The two Americans arrested Monday served in Iraq and Afghanistan with him in the U.S. military, Goudreau said, adding that they were part of this alleged mission in Venezuela called 'Operation Gideon.' The aim was to capture Maduro, he claims.

Sunday’s raid came after an AP report on Friday that revealed how Goudreau was planning a coup by training 300 soldiers in Colombia.

However, Ephraim Mattos, a former US Navy SEAL who trained some of the would-be combatants in tactical medicine, warned it was doomed to failure.

'You're not going to take out Maduro with 300 hungry, untrained men,' he said.

Venezuela has been in a deepening political and economic crisis under Maduro's rule. Crumbling public services such as running water, electricity and medical care have driven nearly 5 million to migrate.

But Maduro still controls all levers of power despite a U.S.-led campaign to oust him. It recently indicted Maduro as a drug trafficker and offered a $15 million reward for his arrest.

Venezuela and the United States broke diplomatic ties last year amid heightened tensions, so there is no U.S. embassy in Caracas. Officials from the U.S. State Department did not respond Monday to a request by The Associated Press for comment.

'I've tried to engage everybody I know at every level,' Goudreau said of the attempt to help his detained colleagues. 'Nobody's returning my calls. It's a nightmare.'

Goudreau's account of the confusing raid has at times seemed contradictory — for example, he says he was plotting a rebellion for months while claiming not to have received a single penny.

Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaidó on Monday denied having anything to do with Goudreau

Guaidó said in a statement that he has 'no relationship nor responsibility for any actions' taken by Goudreau, who repeated assertions that Guaidó had a contract with Silvercorp USA, the war veteran's Florida-based security company, though he said he was paid only a tiny share of the amount agreed upon.

Meanwhile, a self-aggrandizing Maduro has thrived broadcasting videos on state TV of what he says was a flawless defense of the nation's sovereignty.

On Monday, Maduro said 'The main objective was to kill the President of Venezuela,' during a televised speech on state television. 'A terrorist attack in the middle of a pandemic while our people rested one night.'

The government said it has mobilized more than 25,000 troops to hunt for other rebel cells.

Kay Denman, the mother of one of the Americans, said the last time she heard from her son was a few weeks when he texted her from an undisclosed location to ask how she was coping with the coronavirus pandemic.

She said she never heard her son discuss Venezuela and only learned of his possible capture there after his friends called when they saw the reports on social media.

'The first time I heard Jordan Goudreau's name was today,' she said when reached at her home in Austin, Texas.

Goudreau has said he reached an agreement with the U.S.-backed Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaidó to overthrow Maduro, which Guaidó has denied. The opposition leader said he had nothing to do with Sunday's raid.

Goudreau says Guaidó never fulfilled the agreement, but the former Green Beret pushed ahead with an underfunded operation with just 60 fighters, including the two U.S. veterans.

He said he last communicated with Denman and Berry when they were adrift in a boat 'hugging' the Caribbean coast of Venezuela. They were still in their boat following an initial confrontation with the Venezuelan Navy early Sunday, he said.

'They were running dangerously low on fuel,' Goudreau said. 'If they had gone onto landfall, they would have gone to a safe house.'

Goudreau said the two were waiting for a boat on the Caribbean island of Aruba with emergency fuel to help extract them.

The ex green beret who masterminded foiled attack on Maduro Ex-Green Beret Jordan Goudreau, 43, is an American citizen and three-time Bronze Star recipient for bravery in Iraq and Afghanistan, where he served as a medic in US Army special forces. Two former special forces colleagues said Goudreau was always at the top of his class: a cell leader with a superb intellect for handling sources, an amazing shot and a devoted mixed martial arts fighter who still cut his hair high and tight. At the end of an otherwise distinguished military career, the Canadian-born Goudreau was investigated in 2013 for allegedly defrauding the Army of $62,000 in housing stipends. After retiring in 2016, he worked as a private security contractor in Puerto Rico following Hurricane Maria. In 2018, he set up Silvercorp USA, a private security firm, near his home on Florida's Space Coast to embed counter-terror agents in schools disguised as teachers. He is said to live in Cocoa Beach, Florida, with his dog Finn. According to the website, Silvercorp has planned and led International security teams for the President of the United States as well as the Secretary of Defense. The company's website features photos and videos of Goudreau firing machine guns in battle, running shirtless up a pyramid, flying on a private jet and sporting a military backpack with a rolled-up American flag. 'He was always chasing the golden BB,' said Drew White, a former business partner at Silvercorp, using military slang for a one-in-a-million shot. White said he broke with his former special forces comrade last fall when Goudreau asked for help raising money to fund his Venezuelan regime change initiative. 'As supportive as you want to be as a friend, his head wasn't in the world of reality,' said White. 'Nothing he said lined up. Advertisement

Venezuelan state TV showed showed images of several unidentified men handcuffed and lying prone in a street. One video clip showed authorities handling a shirtless man in handcuffs.

He was identified as a National Guardsman Capt. Antonio Sequea, who participated in a barracks revolt against Maduro a year ago. Goudreau said Sequea was a commander working with him in recent days on the ground in Venezuela.

Maduro ally and Attorney General Tarek William Saab said that in total they've arrested 114 people suspected in the attempted attack and they are on the hunt of 92 others.

Goudreau, a three-time Bronze Star U.S. combat veteran, claims to have helped organize the deadly seaborne raid from Colombia. Goudreau said the operation had received no aid from Guaidó or the U.S. or Colombian governments.

Opposition politicians and U.S. authorities issued statements suggesting Maduro's allies had fabricated the assault to draw attention away from the country's problems.

Goudreau said by telephone earlier Monday that 52 other fighters had infiltrated Venezuelan territory and were in the first stage of a mission to recruit members of the security forces to join their cause.

An AP investigation published Friday found that Goudreau had been working with a retired Venezuelan army general — who now faces U.S. narcotics charges — to train dozens of deserters from Venezuela's security forces at secret camps inside neighboring Colombia. The goal was to mount a cross-border raid that would end in Maduro's arrest.

Both Colombia and the United States have repeatedly denied previous Venezuelan allegations of backing military plots against the socialist government.

'We have little reason to believe anything that comes out of the former regime,' said a spokesperson with the State Department Bureau of Western Hemisphere Affairs, speaking Sunday on condition of anonymity, referring to Maduro's government.

'The Maduro regime has been consistent in its use of misinformation in order to shift focus from its mismanagement of Venezuela.'

Maduro ally and Attorney General Tarek William Saab said in a press conference (pictured) that in total they've arrested 114 people suspected in the attempted attack and they are on the hunt of 92 others

Colombia's Foreign Affairs Ministry also rejected the claims made by what it called 'Maduro's dictatorial regime.'

Opposition leader Juan Guaido said the government was seeking to distract from recent violent events including a deadly prison riot on Friday and bloody Caracas gang battle on Saturday night.

'The regime is seeking to divert attention with a supposed incident in La Guaira plagued with inconsistencies, doubts and contradictions,' Guaidó's press team said in a statement.

Venezuela has been in a deepening political and economic crisis in recent years under Maduro's rule. Crumbling public services such as running water, electricity and medical care has driven nearly 5 million to migrate.

A coalition of nearly 60 nations backs opposition leader Guaidó as Venezuela's legitimate leader, saying Maduro's 2018 election was a sham because the most popular opposition candidates were banned from running.

The United States has led a campaign to oust Maduro, increasing pressure in recent weeks by indicting the socialist leader as a narco-trafficker and offering a $15 million reward for his arrest.

The U.S. also has increased stiff sanctions, cutting off Venezuela's oil sector to choke Maduro from a key source of hard cash.

Iván Simonovis, a former high-ranking Venezuelan police official who now advises opposition leaders on intelligence strategy from Washington, speculated on Twitter that there might have been a clash between security forces on Sunday and suggested Maduro's government created the story of a plot to justify 'repression against the interim government and any Venezuelan who opposes the dictatorship.'

But in addition to U.S. economic and diplomatic pressure, Maduro's government has faced several small-scale military threats, including an attempt to assassinate Maduro with a drone and Guaidó's call for a military uprising, which was joined by few soldiers.

Maduro has overseen a six-year economic crisis that has left many citizens unable to obtain basic food and medicine and forced nearly five million people to emigrate.

The United States and dozens of other countries disavowed Maduro after his disputed 2018 election, which they say was rigged. They instead recognize Guaidó, who is head of the country's legislature.

But Maduro retains the backing of the country's armed forces as well as countries including China and Russia, which have harshly criticized the U.S. sanctions.

The Associated Press reported on Friday that an apparently ill-funded attempt to amass an invasion force of 300 men in Colombia involving a former Venezuelan military officer and Goudreau, suffered setbacks in March when a main organizer was arrested, an arms cache was seized and some participants abandoned its camps.

Retired Venezuelan National Guard Capt. Javier Nieto Quintero appeared in a video with Goudreau, urging members of the armed forces to help liberate the nation in an action he called 'Operation Gedeón.'

Nieto, when contacted by AP on a Miami telephone, declined to comment and hung up. Goudreau also declined to comment in a call from Caracas.

Diosdado Cabello, the No. 2 most powerful person in the country and eminence grise of Venezuela's vast intelligence network, linked Sunday's attack to key players in that alleged plot.

One of the men he said was killed, a man nicknamed 'the Panther,' had been identified as involved in obtaining weapons for the force in Colombia.

The U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) released a wanted poster for Nicolas Maduro with a reward of up to $15 million for information leading to the President's arrest in March

Maduro and his allies say the Trump administration is determined to end Venezuela's socialist government to exploit the South American nation's vast underground oil reserves. Maduro remains in power, backed by the military and with international support from Cuba, Russia, China and Iran.

Defense Minister Vladimir Padrino López, speaking on state TV Sunday backed by armed soldiers and tanks units, called the attackers mercenaries who 'don't have souls. They're cowards.'

Guaidó accused Maduro's government of seizing on this example of unrest to draw the world's attention away from embarrassing bloodshed in other parts of the country, including a prison riot days earlier that left at least 40 dead.

'Of course, there are patriotic members of the military willing to fight for Venezuela,' Guaidó said. 'But it's clear that what happened in Vargas is another distraction ploy.'

According to the Johns Hopkins University, Venezuela has seen 357 confirmed cases of the coronavirus, with 10 deaths resulting from the disease.

The U.N. has said Venezuela could be one of the most vulnerable countries due to the disease due to a lack of hygiene products and water is hospitals, compounded by the overall impoverishment of the population

How the former Green Beret behind the failed Venezuela coup plot provided security for Donald Trump and hatched the plot after meeting the President's bodyguard, a billionaire member of the Kraft family and the country's opposition leaders in Miami

The leader of the failed Venezuela coup that has seen two former US special forces soldiers taken into custody struck on the idea after enlisting a billionaire backer and meeting with Donald Trump’s bodyguard.

Ex-Green Beret Jordan Goudreau, 43, whose website claims he previously worked security for President Trump,attended a conference in Miami of opposition leaders and it is here that he met Roen Kraft, an eccentric descendant of the cheese-making family, who then began raising money for a ‘private coup’, according to an Associated Press report.

Kraft allegedly lured prospective donors with the promise of preferential access to negotiate deals in the energy and mining sectors if the coup was a success. He represented himself as the 'prime contractor' of Venezuela.

Kraft denies giving Goudreau any money.

Goudreau also held meetings with Donald Trump’s longtime bodyguard Keith Schiller who accompanied him to the Miami event. At the meeting, Goudreau and Schiller discussed the security of opposition leader Juan Guaidó with his representatives.

The White House says Schiller cut off all contact after the meeting and Guaidó also denies involvement in the plot.

Goudreau's focus on Venezuela began in February 2019, when he worked security at a concert in support of Guaidó. Goudreau is seen working the concert in a picture posted on Instagram

'Controlling chaos on the Venezuela border where a dictator looks on with apprehension,' wrote Goudreau in an Instagram post of the concert (pictured), dubbed 'Venezuelan Aid Live'

Goudreau identified himself Sunday as the leader of a plot to overthrow Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro named 'Operation Gedeón'.

The idea was sparked in February 2019 when Goudreau worked security at 'Live Aid for Venezuala’, a concert in support of Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaidó organized by the British billionaire Richard Branson on the Venezuelan-Colombian border.

The three-time Bronze Star recipient came back from the concert looking to capitalize on the Trump administration's growing interest in toppling Maduro, and he held conversations with Guaido’s envoys; Roen Kraft and Trump's bodyguard Keith Schiller.

It's unclear where Alcalá and Goudreau (pictured) got their backing, and whatever money was collected for the initiative appears to have been meager

After retiring in 2016, Goudreau worked as a private security contractor in Puerto Rico following Hurricane Maria. In 2018, he set up Silvercorp USA (pictured), a private security firm, near his home in Florida to embed counter-terror agents in schools disguised as teachers

Planning for the incursion began after an April 30, 2019, barracks revolt by a cadre of soldiers who swore loyalty to Madura's would-be replacement, Juan Guaidó, the opposition leader recognized by the U.S. and some 60 other nations as Venezuela´s rightful leader.

Contrary to U.S. expectations at the time, key Maduro aides never joined with the opposition and the government quickly quashed the uprising.

A few weeks later, some soldiers and politicians involved in the failed rebellion retreated to the JW Marriott in Bogota, Colombia.

The hotel was a center of intrigue among Venezuelan exiles. For this occasion, conference rooms were reserved for what one participant described as the 'Star Wars summit of anti-Maduro goofballs' - military deserters accused of drug trafficking, shady financiers and former Maduro officials seeking redemption.

Among those angling in the open lobby was Goudreau, according to five people who met with the former soldier.

By this time, Goudreau had met with Schiller and accompanied him to a meeting in Miami with activist Lester Toledo, then Guaidó's coordinator for the delivery of humanitarian aid.

It is not certain how the pair met but Goudreau claims to have worked security at President Donald Trump's rallies with his private company Silvercorp.

According to the website, Silvercorp has planned and led International security teams for the President of the United States, as well as the Secretary of Defense, and Goudreau is seen in a video allegedly working at a rally.

At the Miami meeting, there was a lively discussion with Schiller about the need to beef up security for Guaidó and his growing team of advisers inside Venezuela and across the world, according to a person familiar with the meeting.

Schiller thought Goudreau was naive and in over his head, however, and he cut off all contact following the meeting, said a person close to the former White House official.

Schiller attended a March 2019 event at the University Club in Washington D.C. for potential donors with activist Lester Toledo (center), then Guaidó's coordinator for the delivery of humanitarian aid

In Bogota, however, Toledo introduced Goudreau to a rebellious former Venezuelan military officer the American would come to trust above all others - Cliver Alcalá, ringleader of the Venezuelan military deserters.

Alcalá, a retired major general in Venezuela´s army, seemed an unlikely hero to restore democracy to his homeland. In 2011, he was sanctioned by the U.S. for allegedly supplying FARC guerrillas in Colombia with surface-to-air missiles in exchange for cocaine.

And last month, Alcalá was indicted by U.S. prosecutors alongside Maduro as one of the architects of a narcoterrorist conspiracy that allegedly sent 250 metric tons of cocaine every year to the U.S.

Alcalá is now in federal custody in New York awaiting trial. But before his surrender in Colombia, where he had been living since 2018, he had emerged as a forceful opponent of Maduro, not shy about urging military force.

Over two days of meetings with Goudreau and Toledo at the JW Marriott, Alcalá explained how he had selected 300 combatants from among the throngs of low-ranking soldiers who abandoned Maduro and fled to Colombia in the early days of Guaidó's uprising, said three people who participated in the meeting and insisted on anonymity to discuss sensitive conversations.

Alcalá said several dozen men were already living in three camps he maintained in and around the desert-like La Guajira peninsula that Colombia shares with Venezuela, the three said. Among the combatants in the camps was an exiled national guardsman accused of participating in a 2018 drone attack on Maduro.

Goudreau told Alcalá his company could prepare the men for battle, according to the three sources. The two sides discussed weapons and equipment for the volunteer army, with Goudreau estimating a budget of around $1.5 million for a rapid strike operation.

Goudreau told participants at the meeting that he had high-level contacts in the Trump administration who could assist the effort, although he offered few details, the three people said. Over time, many of the people involved in the plan to overthrow Maduro would come to doubt his word.

From the outset, the audacious plan split an opposition coalition already sharply divided by egos and strategy. There were concerns that Alcalá, with a murky past and ties to the regime through a brother who was Maduro´s ambassador to Iran, couldn't be trusted.

Others worried about going behind the backs of their Colombian allies and the U.S. government.

They did have apparent backing, however, from Roen Kraft, an eccentric descendant of the cheese-making family who — along with former Trump bodyguard Schiller — was among those meeting with opposition envoys in Miami and Washington.

At some point, Kraft allegedly started raising money among his own circle of fellow trust-fund friends for what he described as a 'private coup' to be carried out by Silvercorp, according to two businessmen who he asked for money who spoke to the Associated Press.

Kraft allegedly lured prospective donors with the promise of preferential access to negotiate deals in the energy and mining sectors with an eventual Guaidó government, said one of the businessmen. He provided AP a two-page, unsigned draft memorandum for a six-figure commitment he said was sent by Kraft in October in which he represents himself as the 'prime contractor' of Venezuela.

But it was never clear if Kraft really had the inside track with the Venezuelans.

In a phone interview with AP, Kraft acknowledged meeting with Goudreau three times last year. But he said the two never did any business together and only discussed the delivery of humanitarian aid for Venezuela. He said Goudreau broke off all communications with him on Oct. 14, when it seemed he was intent on a military action.

'I never gave him any money,' said Kraft.

Goudreau's plot quickly began to crumble in early March when one of the volunteer combatants was arrested after sneaking across the border into Venezuela from Colombia.

Shortly after, Colombian police stopped a truck transporting a cache of brand new weapons and tactical equipment worth around $150,000, including spotting scopes, night vision goggles, two-way radios and 26 American-made assault rifles with the serial numbers rubbed off.

Fifteen brown-colored helmets were manufactured by High-End Defense Solutions, a Miami-based military equipment vendor owned by a Venezuelan immigrant family.

High-End Defense Solutions is the same company that Goudreau visited in November and December, allegedly to source weapons, according to two former Venezuelan soldiers who claim to have helped the American select the gear but later had a bitter falling out with Goudreau amid accusations that they were moles for Maduro.

Nonetheless, Goudreau continued with the plot which launched Sunday but was quickly foiled by Maduro.

Early Sunday morning, an armed group of ten individuals used speedboats to land on a beach in the Caribbean port city of La Guaira.

'The main objective was to kill the President of Venezuela,' Maduro said Monday during a televised speech on state television. 'A terrorist attack in the middle of a pandemic while our people rested one night.'

Eight suspects were killed and two were arrested.

The failed attack continued Monday when authorities arrested eight men after they were alerted by fishermen in Chuao, a village on the northern coast of the state of Aragua.

Maduro ally and Attorney General Tarek William Saab said that in total they've arrested 114 people suspected in the attempted attack and they are on the hunt of 92 others.

About 150 people had gathered at Alberta Park shortly before the scheduled 9pm march.

Some people were handing out pizza, water and snacks. Others offered homemade shields.

As night fell chants of 'Black Lives Matter' rose in the air.

'If you're not here for Black Lives Matter, you're in the wrong place,' one speaker told the gathering.

Protesters then set off to march towards the Portland Police Bureau’s North Precinct, where previous protests have turned destructive.

The group, many dressed all in black, chanted: 'No good cops in a racist system.'

When they arrived at North Precinct, shortly after 9pm, Oregon Live reported that they were met with about a dozen armored officers.

Some held batons, while others carried crowd-control weapons, the site said.

At 10:23pm, police warned protesters that acts of vandalism, lighting fires or throwing objects could be met with arrest or use of force, including tear gas. At one point, police ordered an individual in the crowd to stop shining a strobe light at officers.

Monday's planned demonstrations came after Trump once again aired his distaste for Portland's protests.

Donald Trump on Monday morning tweeted once again that Portland was 'out of control'

Officials in the city of 650,000 have rejected his offer of National Guard troops, and said that federal forces sent in earlier this year to protect federal buildings overstepped the mark, and worsened tensions.

Protests on Friday, Saturday and Sunday night descended into violence, with a small crowd squaring off with riot police.

Twenty five people were arrested during Saturday and Sunday nights - among them Demetria Hester, a prominent activist who leads Mothers United for Black Lives Matter.

She is also a survivor of the May 2017 Portland train attack, when white supremacist Jeremy Christian murdered two people.

She testified against him in his trial.

Hester was accused of disorderly conduct and interfering with a peace officer, both misdemeanors.

She was released from custody Monday afternoon, and Brent Weisberg, spokesman for the Multnomah County District Attorney's Office, said the DA had declined prosecution and that the court will dismiss the charges.

'The prosecution decline decision was in the interest of justice upon reviewing the police reports in this matter,' Weisberg said.

The busy road Camberwell Road in south London has since reopened, but police have confirmed a number of arrests have been made and as many as 60 protestors remain behind a police cordon.

Shocking scenes around The Lighthouse theatre appeared to show protesters wielding sticks clashing with Met Police officers, bringing traffic to a standstill.

The protest is related to 'tensions in the Eritrean community', the Met Police confirmed.

One person on X said he heard the Eritrean embassy was in the middle of a meeting when the protesters showed up at the scene.

'People I've talked to say that the Eritrean embassy was holding a meeting and the protesters turned up and there was a confrontation between the two groups,' he said.

'Now they are kettling protesters while the Eritrean government staff are still inside the building I think.'

Southwark Police put a statement out on X which read: 'Officers are on scene in Camberwell Road, SE5 where there is a protest with approximately 50 people gathered outside a private venue.

'Additional officers are on their way to the location to assist with the demonstration.'

The force later added: 'Camberwell Road has now reopened after a demonstration outside a private venue.

'A group of approximately 60 protesters remain behind a police cordon. A number of arrests have been made.'

Police said a section 35 dispersal order has been put in place in Camberwell Road until 7am tomorrow - enabling officers to exclude individuals or groups of people from the area for 48 hours.

The Lighthouse theatre hosts large and small events, holding weddings, themed parties and conferences.

Footage posted on social media shows people hitting cop cars with sticks as they swarm the area.

Huge crowds can be seen blocking the road as cars are forced to a halt and a large police presence surrounds the area.

Shocking scenes appear to also show protesters with blue flags aiming sticks at officers, with one launching a traffic barrier into the line of police.

The protest is thought to have been sparked by representatives of the Eritrean government attending a meeting in London.

The controversial African nation remains under the 'one-man dictatorship' of President Isaias Afewerki, international advocacy agany Human Rights Watch reports, with 'no legislature, no independent civil society organizations or media outlets and no independent judiciary'.

Tens of thousands of people have fled Eritrea for Europe, many alleging they were mistreated by Afwerki' repressive government.

The conflicts surrounding gatherings highlight the deep divide among members of the Eritrean diaspora, those who remain close to the government and those who have fled to live in exile and strongly oppose Afwerki.

In September an Eritrean culture festival in Stuttgart descended into violent chaos as opposing mobs attacked each other and police with stones, bottles, and wooden planks.

The clashes broke out between Eritrean government supporters and opponents as some 200 protesters gathered outside the festival in the southwestern German city.

As violence flared, dozens of people were injured, including at least 26 officers. One resident described the scene as 'like a war'.

2 Aug 2024 17.15 BST Summary of the day so far Today’s UK politics live blog will be closing shortly. Thank you for following it and for sending in your emails. Here is a summary of the day so far: Keir Starmer returned to Southport on Friday, visiting the town for the second time this week after Monday’s knife attack. The prime minister met members of the local community, according to the Liverpool Echo, along with metro mayor Steve Rotheram, Merseyside chief constable Serena Kennedy and representatives from the police, faith groups, health services and the education and voluntary sectors. He also paid a visit to Alder Hey children’s hospital in Liverpool, where many of the victims of Monday’s attack were treated. Starmer thanked staff for their hard work and professionalism in responding to the attack.

There is potential for more violence in the wake of the Southport attack, a Home Office minister has said, as he warned those planning on organising further disorder “we will be watching you”. Asked how concerned the government is about the prospect of further disorder on the streets this weekend, David Hanson told LBC Radio: “There is that potential. But I always say to anybody who’s organising this, we will be watching you.”

John Woodcock, the UK government’s adviser on political violence and disruption, said police should be prepared to step in if it appears troublemakers were travelling to incite riots. Woodcock, who is a crossbench peer, said disinformation contributed to the unrest which broke out in a number of locations around England after the Southport attack. Asked about the best way to prevent the riots, he said protests were sometimes being used as a cover for “violent action”. He said: “People absolutely have the right to protest in this country, but they do not have the right to riot.”

The Guardian has seen details of at least 19 far-right rallies being planned for the coming days in towns and cities across England. Many of the events are taking place under the banner “enough is enough” and “protect our kids” – the same slogan used by demonstrators outside Downing Street on Wednesday evening.

Zara Mohammed, the secretary-general of the Muslim Council of Britain (MCB), has said hundreds of mosques across the country will be strengthening their security and protective measures this weekend. Mohammed said on Friday: “Yesterday we hosted a mosque security community briefing and we had representation from hundreds of mosques across the country and there was palpable fear.”

The campaign group, Stand Up to Racism warned that far-right demonstrations are being organised for this coming weekend in more than 25 towns and cities. It adds that “some of these [demonstrations] are specifically targeting mosques”.

Nine counter-demonstrations are due to take place this weekend, said Stand Up to Racism. On Saturday, there will be counter-demonstrations in Liverpool, Cardiff, Leeds, Manchester, Bristol, Nottingham and Stoke-on-Trent, it said. On Sunday, counter-demonstrations are scheduled for Rotherham and Weymouth.

Nottinghamshire police said it was aware of “two protests that may be taking place in Nottingham city centre this Saturday” , and that there would be a “robust police response” to any disorder.

South Yorkshire police said it was “aware of a planned protest in Rotherham this weekend” and that there may be “an increased police presence across the county”.

Thames Valley police said it is aware of a “potential planned protest this weekend in High Wycombe” and that officers would “swiftly respond” if it escalates into violent disorder.

Liverpool city region mayor Steve Rotheram said he was “concerned” that there could be a “repeat of violence somewhere in the Liverpool city region” , but added: “We know exactly what we’d need to do to ensure that these things are nipped in the bud.” Rotheram also told ITV’s Good Morning Britain that Nigel Farage was giving “legitimacy” to violent rioters and “excusing them”.

The Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) said it is aware of calls “to block roads using women and children” and for a march to an Islamic centre in Belfast to be held on Saturday.

Merseyside police has made seven arrests related to the violent disorder in Southport on Tuesday evening , with further arrests to be made over the coming weeks, the force has said.

Former head of counter-terrorism policing Neil Basu said Farage “should think very carefully” about “the power of his words”. Asked about comments made by the Reform UK leader, Basu told ITV’s Good Morning Britain on Friday: “That is a far-right politician once again trying to direct policing and law and order. He doesn’t speak for tens of millions of people, the prime minister does – who has to serve the whole population, not just the ones he likes.” Basu warned that police forces could be facing a “long, hot summer”.

The culture secretary said her concern is that “warning signs” are spotted in the future, after former BBC presenter Huw Edwards admitted having indecent images of children. Lisa Nandy asked the BBC to look into whether it can recoup money from Huw Edwards’ pay packet, during a meeting with director general Tim Davie on Thursday. Nandy also appeared to suggest that some of findings of an internal investigation into Edwards should be made public.

Rachel Reeves has been urged to reverse her “ill-advised” decision to strip most pensioners of their winter fuel payments, or risk millions of people being forced to choose between turning on the heating or preparing a hot meal. Jan Shortt, the general secretary of the National Pensioners Convention (NPC), one of the UK’s biggest campaigning organisation for older people, has written to the chancellor, noting many older people may “not survive to see the spring or any other season” after the payments are cut.

Meghan Gallacher, the deputy leader of the Scottish Conservatives, has become the first woman to put herself forward to replace Douglas Ross as leader of the party. Gallacher – considered a rising star of the party – said that Scottish Tories needed “an open leadership contest, debating ideas and the future direction of our party”, the day after the timetable for the contest was announced.

The governor of the Bank of England has dismissed concerns raised by the Conservatives that the new government’s plans for public sector pay rises would risk stoking inflation and keep interest rates higher for longer. The Bank’s governor, Andrew Bailey, told journalists after the rate announcement that the planned pay awards of 5-6% would have a relatively small impact on headline inflation, and suggested it was not a focus for the Bank.

The Labour government must “change course” on its approach to social care, dozens of sector leaders have said , as they described how announcements this week on funding and charging reforms had been a “bitter pill” to swallow. A letter on behalf of the leaders of 30 organisations in the sector, including Care England, the National Care Forum, Learning Disability England and the Homecare Association, has been sent to health secretary Wes Streeting.

The boss of Royal London, the UK’s biggest insurance group owned by its members, has expressed caution about Labour’s ambition to use pensions to drive economic growth , as he warned of a “ticking timebomb” and urged the government to make greater saving for retirement a priority. The new chancellor, Rachel Reeves, is launching a landmark pensions review, and pledged a “big bang” for private pension funds, as the government wants to unlock billions of pounds to invest in UK infrastructure and housing.

Culture secretary Lisa Nandy has said she will be speaking with sporting bodies about “inclusion, fairness and safety” after what she described as an “incredibly uncomfortable watch” when asked about the Olympic boxing controversy. But Nandy said the “biological facts are far more complicated than is being presented on social media” as she spoke about Italian fighter Angela Carini having abandoned her bout against Algeria’s Imane Khelif this week.

Kemi Badenoch has brought in a Conservative councillor to help on her leadership bid who referred to a female politician in a vulgar manner in a message to another colleague. Badenoch has Tory councillor Oliver Cooper on her team despite it having emerged in legal action that he had sent messages in 2017 about a female councillor to another activist calling her offensive names.

The new Labour government has shelved £1.3bn of funding pledged by the Conservatives for technology and artificial intelligence projects , putting the future of the UK’s first next-generation supercomputer in doubt. The projects, announced last year, include £800m for the creation of an exascale supercomputer at the University of Edinburgh and a further £500m for the AI Research Resource, which funds computing power for AI.

The Home Office threatened to forcibly remove a man from the UK who is likely to be a key witness in the inquest of the asylum seeker who died on the Bibby Stockholm barge. Yusuf Deen Kargbo, 20, a boxer who competed for Sierra Leone in the 2022 Commonwealth Games in Birmingham before claiming asylum, was Leonard Farruku’s roommate on the barge and almost certainly the last person to have seen him alive.

Speaking at the launch of his Conservative leadership campaign, Robert Jenrick said his position on the European convention on human rights (ECHR) was “crystal clear” when asked by journalists whether he would be prepared to leave the ECHR. Jenrick has previously argued for the UK to leave the convention. The main reason the Conservatives lost the election was continuing a “cycle of broken promises” on immigration, he said at the event in Newark, Nottinghamshire, adding that he wants “to breathe new life into our party”.

After Jenrick’s campaign launch, the Liberal Democrats said that the Tory leadership hopeful had a “terrible record of failure” and symbolises how his party has “moved further and further away from lifelong Conservative voters”. Lib Dem deputy leader Daisy Cooper said: “Jenrick is now a symbol of the way the Conservative party has moved further and further away from lifelong Conservative voters in the ‘blue wall’.”

Scottish ministers are being urged to learn lessons from Wales’s introduction of a “lifesaving” default 20mph speed limit.

2 Aug 2024 17.14 BST Pensioner body calls on Reeves to reverse cut to winter fuel allowance Aletha Adu Rachel Reeves has been urged to reverse her “ill-advised” decision to strip most pensioners of their winter fuel payments, or risk millions of people being forced to choose between turning on the heating or preparing a hot meal. The chancellor has faced fury from backbenchers, who have questioned how many older people will die of cold as a result of denying about 10 million pensioners the payments. Jan Shortt, the general secretary of the National Pensioners Convention (NPC), one of the UK’s biggest campaigning organisation for older people, has written to the chancellor, noting many older people may “not survive to see the spring or any other season” after the payments are cut. Reeves said she was making “difficult decisions” after she accused the Conservative government of leaving behind £22bn of unfunded commitments that it had “covered up from the country”. Introducing a means test for the winter fuel payment, where only those on benefits qualify, is expected to cut the number of pensioners receiving the payment from 11.4 million to 1.5 million, saving £1.4bn this financial year. Shortt said in her letter to the chancellor: Our members are angered and concerned about your plan to remove the winter fuel payment from older people who do not receive pension credit. There are already 2 million older people in poverty across the UK. For them, this means living in damp, cold homes, washing in cold water and not using the cooker, all to save money. At least a further 1 million older people live with precarious finances and face growing financial insecurity.” You can read the full piece here: Pensioner body calls on Reeves to reverse cut to winter fuel allowance Read more Share

2 Aug 2024 16.17 BST Social care sector tells health secretary that recent announcements are a 'bitter pill' The Labour government must “change course” on its approach to social care, dozens of sector leaders have said, as they described how announcements this week on funding and charging reforms had been a “bitter pill” to swallow, reports the PA news agency. Chancellor Rachel Reeves used a wider speech on public finances on Monday to state that previously delayed adult social care charging reforms will not be taken forward. This was followed by a written statement from care minister Stephen Kinnock late on Tuesday just as parliament entered summer recess, in which he said the government had decided not to go ahead with a fund dedicated to training the social care workforce. A letter on behalf of the leaders of 30 organisations in the sector, including Care England, the National Care Forum, Learning Disability England and the Homecare Association, has been sent to health secretary Wes Streeting. It said: The last few days have raised alarm bells for those working in adult social care and those drawing on care and support services. Warm words about the economic importance of adult social care and the commitment to identify a cross-party solution to this fundamental public service have rung hollow in light of decisions announced around funding and reform.” According to the PA news agency, the letter described how “choosing not to progress both charging reform and the training and development fund is a bitter pill for social care in a climate where other public services and their workforces are finally having their contribution recognised”. The groups called for “positive action on social care”, adding that there is “time, political capital, and the expertise of a united social care sector to make this happen”. They added: We urge the government to change course and we stand ready to help you transform social care for the millions who work in it and most vitally, rely upon it.” The PA news agency reports that just a day after that announcement, Kinnock said the adult social care training and development fund, which was announced in provisional form by the previous government in April, will not be taken forward due to the need to “manage down overall fiscal pressures in 2024-25”. The minister said the government still intends to provide funding for adult social care “learning and development, with the budget maintained at the level we spent last year”. The decision was described as “desperately shortsighted” by the Nuffield Trust, which said it “looks like yet another troubling decision to deprioritise social care in order to plug gaps in health funding”. The Department of Health and Social Care has been contacted for comment by the PA news agency. Share

I am a father of three young daughters and this was the most horrific crime.” He added: I think that there is an important lesson from this, which is in this incident and in others across the country, they are revealing that there is too much disrespect for our police and for law and order. I want to back the police, I want to ensure that they can take the robust action they need against these individuals and against people like them in all of the incidents we have seen in recent months, right across the country. Because I do not want to live in a country where incidents like this, where disturbances are happening, ever again.” Jenrick refused to be drawn into whether Nigel Farage and Lee Anderson would be welcome in a Tory party under his leadership.

I want to build a big church, a big tent for this party. But it has to be a strong tent. I want to ensure that we are a big church, that it has a common creed. So we have to believe in Conservative principles again. I never want to be going on to a doorstep in a general election in the future and people not know what our party stands for.

2 Aug 2024 15.55 BST Robert Jenrick took aim at the new government at his campaign launch, saying that Labour were guilty of “too many delusions”. He added: If anyone tells you the grown-ups are in charge, just look at Ed Miliband.” The party has “lied about the state of our public finances” and already “begun to break their promises” by hinting at tax rises in the budget, Jenrick claimed. The Tory leadership hopeful told the audience at his campaign launch: I am not going to lie to you, for most of my time as a politician I believed our political system basically worked. I was elected 10 years ago in a byelection here in Newark, I was honoured to be a member of the government of each of the last five Conservative prime ministers. I prided myself on making the system work, on getting things done for my constituents and our country.” While he pointed to his record as housing secretary on housebuilding and reducing homelessness, Jenrick added: “In the last two years, I have come to see that a different approach is needed.” Jenrick insisted that the Conservatives could win the next general election. He told supporters: Our victory here in Newark a few weeks ago tells us a lesson. Each of those MRP polls that said we were going to lose, all the pundits and the commentators who said it was impossible to win here, they were wrong. They got it wrong, we won. And those same pundits, those same pollsters and talking heads down in Westminster, they now say that our party cannot win again. They say that our problems are too intractable, they say we’re too divided, they say that Keir Starmer is destined to be our nation’s prime minister for a decade or more. Well if there’s one lesson of our success here in Newark, it’s this. Nothing in politics is certain. Just as there are no final victories, there are no final defeats.” He added: Enough of defeatism. We can win.” Share Updated at 15.56 BST

2 Aug 2024 15.48 BST Mark Brown A 28-year-old man who took part in violent disorder in Hartlepool sobbed in court as he and his partner admitted criminal charges on Friday. Ryan Sheers was in tears when he appeared before a district judge at Teesside magistrates court in Middlesbrough. Sheers and his partner Stephen Mailen, 54, both Hartlepool, admitted violent disorder. Paul Doney, prosecuting, said Mailen was “constantly in the face of officers” and was gesticulating towards them, shouting, until he was struck on the leg by an officer’s extendable baton. His partner, Sheers, was trying to push through the police cordon, shouting and refusing to move away. He was bitten on the hip by a police dog, the court heard. They were granted conditional bail and will be sentenced at Teesside crown court on 2 September. At the same court three men entered no plea to charges and were remanded in custody until 2 September. Anthony Allen, 42, of Hartlepool, was charged with violent disorder and assaulting an emergency worker. James Elliott, 41, of Hartlepool, was charged with violent disorder. Peter Clark, 47, of no fixed address, was charged with violent disorder and exposure after allegedly showing his buttocks and genitalia to police. John Barton, 33, of Hartlepool, and Dylan Wiley, 28, of Hartlepool, denied violent disorder and were remanded in custody until 2 September. Doney told the court that 200 people were in a group which initially met at the Cenotaph in Hartlepool on Wednesday evening and moved towards mosques and a community centre. Police tried to keep order and came under attack from bricks, eggs and other weapons. Disorder lasted for several hours and a police car was torched, he said. Share

Promising to tell Tory members “hard truths” during the leadership campaign, Jenrick said there were “many reasons” for the party’s defeat in July. He said: But the principal one, the primary one, is that we broke our promise to the British public to deliver controlled and reduced migration and the secure border that the public rightfully demand. We allowed the cycle of broken promises to continue. And as a minister, when I concluded that I couldn’t secure any more changes to our legal migration system, I resigned from cabinet last year because I for one was not willing to be just another minister who makes and breaks promises on immigration.” Share

She told the audience the next Tory leader needed “intellectual rigour and capability”, adding: “Robert has got that.” According to the PA news agency, Jenrick kicked off his speech by praising members of his Newark constituency as “doers” and “makers” who are “proud of our history, they would never denigrate our country.” View image in fullscreen Tory leadership hopeful Robert Jenrick speaking during his campaign launch in Newark, Nottinghamshire, on Friday.

2 Aug 2024 15.17 BST The BBC needs to reassure people after Huw Edwards scandal, says culture secretary The culture secretary says her concern is that “warning signs” are spotted in the future, after former BBC presenter Huw Edwards admitted having indecent images of children. Lisa Nandy asked the BBC to look into whether it can recoup money from Huw Edwards’ pay packet, during a meeting with director general Tim Davie on Thursday. Edwards admitted making indecent photographs, with seven of the 41 images being of the most serious type, earlier in the week, and the BBC acknowledged it knew he was arrested in November. When asked about her meeting with Davie, Nandy told BBC News: We had a very robust and frank discussion about the circumstances around the case, and some of the decisions that have been made during that case and also since. Obviously, I am particularly concerned to make sure that people have confidence in the BBC. I think the director general made a good start yesterday, in going out to be as open and transparent as possible with the public, both about what the BBC knew but also about why they made the decision they did, and also the use of taxpayers’ money, which is obviously important to a lot of people.” According to the PA news agency, Nandy also appeared to suggest that some of findings of an internal investigation into Edwards should be made public. She said: I think we all recognise there is a job of work to do, to get more information in the public domain, to reassure people, not just about the decisions that have been made but also about the action that the BBC will take going forwards. My concern is to make sure warning signs are caught, complaints are acted on, that public money is used well, and to make sure as far as is humanly possible that we don’t have a repeat of this situation in the future.” The Labour MP for Wigan also explained to Sky News that she has “ongoing concerns”, that the BBC needs “futureproofing”, so that whistleblowers are taken seriously and complaints are acted upon. She added: There are outstanding issues that the BBC director general has agreed to take away with his board, and come back to me on, and I’ll look forward to continuing those discussions next week.” Nandy also said that she has asked to see the employment law advice given to the BBC.

She added that Edwards should return his salary, which is estimated to be more than £400,000 last year. Nandy said that she was “very concerned” that taxpayers money was being used to pay Edwards’ salary, when the newsreader was committing “serious crimes”. She added: “I’ve asked the BBC to look at what’s possible.” Share Updated at 15.17 BST

2 Aug 2024 14.54 BST Scottish ministers are being urged to learn lessons from Wales’s introduction of a “lifesaving” default 20mph speed limit, reports the PA news agency. Green transport spokesperson Mark Ruskell made the plea after figures from Wales showed a drop in casualties on 20mph and 30mph roads in the first three months of 2024, after the lower default speed limit was introduced. According to the PA news agency, the number of cases of people being killed or seriously injured on roads with either a 20mph limit or a 30mph limit fell to 78 in the first three months of 2024 – a drop of 23% on the total of 101 that was recorded in the first three months of last year. With Wales’s default limit applying mainly in residential and built-up areas, Ruskell said: Lower speeds save lives. There are people who are alive and well today thanks to Wales’s default 20mph limit.” The Green MSP had previously tried to introduce legislation for Scotland to reduce the default 30mph speed limit to 20mph – but this was voted down by Holyrood in 2019. The then-transport secretary Michael Matheson said while the Scottish government backed efforts to make roads safer, councils were “best placed” to use their local knowledge to decide where 20mph limits should be brought in. But following the reduction in road casualties in Wales, Ruskell urged the government in Scotland to act. He said: We need to learn from their experience and replicate its success across Scotland. Fundamentally it’s about safety and making our neighbourhoods more welcoming and accessible for all.” The Bute House Agreement between the Scottish Greens and the SNP included a commitment for all appropriate roads in built-up areas to have a 20mph limit by 2025 – and Ruskell urged the Scottish government not to backtrack on that commitment despite the collapse earlier this year of the powersharing deal. He said: We have already made really important progress across parts of the country, with life-saving 20mph defaults becoming more and more common, and it’s crucial that the Scottish government supports councils to finish the job as soon as possible. We all benefit from safer streets, and a default 20mph speed limit in built-up areas is a simple, quick and proven way to reduce road casualties.” A Transport Scotland spokesperson said: The Scottish government remains supportive of 20mph limits and continues to work with local authorities to promote their implementation on adjoining trunk roads where it is appropriate to do so.” Share

2 Aug 2024 14.38 BST Home Office threatened to deport man likely to be key witness in Bibby Stockholm inquest Diane Taylor The Home Office threatened to forcibly remove a man from the UK who is likely to be a key witness in the inquest of the asylum seeker who died on the Bibby Stockholm barge. Leonard Farruku, 26, an asylum seeker from Albania, was found dead on the Bibby Stockholm in Portland, Dorset, used by the Home Office to accommodate hundreds of asylum seekers, on 12 December last year. An inquest is scheduled to open into his death in September 2025. Yusuf Deen Kargbo, 20, a boxer who competed for Sierra Leone in the 2022 Commonwealth Games in Birmingham before claiming asylum, was Farruku’s roommate on the barge and almost certainly the last person to have seen him alive. It was Kargbo who raised the alarm when he woke early on the morning of 12 September, found Farruku was not in his bed in the bunk they shared and that the door of the bathroom was locked with no response when Kargbo repeatedly knocked on the door. Police forced open the bathroom door and discovered Farruku’s body. After Farruku’s death, Kargbo was moved to Home Office accommodation in Wales but said he was woken up there at 6am two and a half weeks ago, arrested and taken to Harmondsworth immigration removal centre, near Heathrow, because the Home Office had rejected his asylum claim.

2 Aug 2024 14.24 BST Ben Quinn Less than three hours after the stabbing attack on Monday that led to the death of three children, an AI-generated image was shared on X by an account called Europe Invasion. It depicted bearded men in traditional Muslim dress outside the Houses of Parliament, one waving a knife, behind a crying child in a union jack T-shirt. The tweet, which has since been viewed 900,000 times, was captioned: “We must protect our children!” and shared by one of the most potent accounts for misinformation about the Southport stabbings. AI technology has been used in other ways, including an anti-immigration Facebook group that illustrated a call to attend a rally in Middlesbrough by generating an image of a large crowd at the town’s cenotaph. Platforms like Suno – which employs AI to generate music complete with vocals and instruments – have been used to create online songs combining references to Southport with xenophobic content. Titles include “Southport Saga” featuring an AI female voice singing lyrics such as “hunt them down somehow”. Experts have warned that new tools and ways of organising have seen Britain’s fractured far right exploit the Southport attack to unify and rejuvenate its presence on the streets. In a surge of activity not seen for years, more than 10 protests are being promoted across social media platforms such as X, TikTok and Facebook in the aftermath of violent disorder up and down the country. Death threats against the UK prime minister, incitement to attack government property and extreme antisemitism were also among the comments on the Telegram channel of one extreme-right outfit this week.

https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/03/trump-supporters-election-results,1,"“As Republicans, we are locked and loaded and ready to go.”

The startling comment came from a mother of five and grandmother of two, Vikki Westbrook, as she lined up on Sunday outside an aircraft hangar in rural North Carolina. She had come to hear Donald Trump make one of his last pitches of the 2024 presidential election.

Westbrook, 55, wasn’t entirely joking with her “locked and loaded” remark. Nor was she being entirely frivolous.

She does own guns, she said, though she wouldn’t specify how many.

Personally, she intended to avoid any trouble that might erupt in the wake of Tuesday’s election, she said. “I have kids, I can’t afford to go to prison. And I don’t like orange.”

It’s her fellow Make America Great Again (Maga) supporters whom she fears might be tempted to take action should the former president lose the election. “At this point, a lot of Republicans aren’t going to take it any longer. They won’t let the election be stolen from us twice.”

Westbrook remains convinced that the 2020 presidential election was snatched from Trump. Now she is equally certain that should Kamala Harris win on Tuesday, it will be for one reason only.

“Only if they cheat. I’m absolutely positive of that.”

Trump has been studiously nurturing such passions for years, his rhetoric rising in intensity in recent days. He has repeatedly refused to confirm that he will accept the results of the vote count, and earlier on Sunday he told supporters in Pennsylvania that he “shouldn’t have left” the White House four years ago.

A recent survey by the Public Religion Research Institute recorded that one in four Republican Trump supporters believe that were Trump to lose the election, he should declare the results invalid and do “whatever it takes” to retake the White House. That’s a sobering finding, but a grossly understated one, judging from the mood at Trump’s Kinston rally.

“People will riot if Trump doesn’t win,” said Cedric Perness, 38, an African American Trump supporter. He said it would be too dangerous for him to participate in any post-election unrest – “I’d get killed right there.”

Instead he does what he can, he said, to help Trump by selling merchandise on his campaign’s behalf. He has a stall of hats and T-shirts, some saying: “You missed bitches. Two times!”

In the final stages of the 2024 race, Trump has been whipping up the passions of his millions of devoted followers to a fever pitch. In the last three days of campaigning alone he has made four stops in North Carolina, a battleground state which the Democrats have won only twice since Jimmy Carter in 1976 (the other time being Barack Obama in 2008).

Trump must hold North Carolina to have a clear shot at returning to the White House.

In these frantic last hours, he has pursued a two-pronged strategy to fire up his followers. On the one hand, he has been raising their expectations by claiming that he is well ahead in the polls.

“We’re going to have on Tuesday a landslide that’s too big to rig,” a tired and hoarse-sounding Trump told the Kinston crowd. “We have a big lead. We have a big lead. The fake news, they don’t tell you this. We have a big, beautiful lead.”

In fact, poll trackers suggest that he and Harris remain neck and neck in North Carolina and the other six critical swing states.

On the other hand, Trump has also been laying the foundations of a renewed conspiracy, should he need it, to subvert the election results by alleging widespread fraud. He touted the false accusation at the Kinston rally that Democrats are enabling non-citizens to vote in vast numbers, accusing the Biden administration of pursuing an open-border policy on the southern border with Mexico “maybe [because they] want to put them on the voting rolls. That’s probably the reason.”

Supporters at the rally faithfully parroted the lie on Sunday.

“That’s why they opened the border, to allow all the illegals in so they could vote for Democrats,” said a woman in the line who declined to give her name. “There’s always been corruption in this country, but I had no idea it was this bad. America has been run into the ground – anyone with half a brain can see that.”

Almost as pervasive as the supporters’ belief in the demonic intentions of Democrats was their frustration at what they could do about it. Last time around, such toxic emotions culminated in the January 6 insurrection at the US Capitol.

The Kinston rally goers, following Trump’s lead, universally dismissed January 6 as a “set-up” in which peaceful and patriotic Americans were lured into a dastardly deep-state trap. Westbrook, the “locked and loaded” grandmother, admitted to having been present at the Capitol that day.

Hundreds of Trump supporters, driven to distraction by the then president’s “stop the steal” rhetoric, stormed the heart of American democracy on that day. In the violent clashes that ensued, approximately 140 police officers were assaulted.

That’s not how Westbrook sees it. “It wasn’t what they said happened. The only people causing trouble were antifa, they were put into us to cause problems.”

This is a lot for any American voter to be carrying. The 2020 election was stolen from her candidate of choice, she firmly believes, and now she’s worried that Tuesday could see a repeat performance.

“Four years ago I felt angry, very angry. This time I will be even more angry.”

Should her worst fears come to pass, and Trump lose, where will all that powerful emotion go?

https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/may/27/belarus-dissident-arrested-collaborator-raman-pratasevich,1,"Two years ago, Raman Pratasevich, a young Belarusian dissident blogger, was white-knuckled, begging a Ryanair flight crew not to make an emergency landing at Minsk airport.

He said: “Don’t do this, they will kill me, I am a refugee,” according to a fellow passenger. The plane, escorted by a Belarusian Mig-29 fighter jet sent to force it down, landed anyway. Pratasevich was promptly arrested.

Last week he emerged from custody. The activist and blogger, accused of more than 1,586 crimes, was charged on 10 counts including conspiracy to seize power. He was sentenced to eight years in prison and then promptly pardoned, his reward from the Belarusian dictator, Alexander Lukashenko, for becoming a full-throated mouthpiece of the regime.

If Pratasevich still has his life, then Lukashenko’s price has been the young activist’s dignity. The boyish 28-year-old now appears regularly on Belarusian state television and other propaganda outlets, where he plays a new role: a penitent defector from the opposition, who has denounced his former allies and now extols the benevolence of the Belarusian dictator, day after day.

“I’m insanely thankful to the country and personally to the president,” he said on camera shortly after his release. In a long interview on state television, he apologised to the riot police who “defended the country” during the mass protests of 2020, the largest in Belarus since the fall of the Soviet Union, and claimed he had been ordered to stir up the protests to create a pretext for international sanctions against Belarus.

At the darkest moment of his imprisonment, Pratasevich denounced his girlfriend Sofia Sapega, who was arrested alongside him and had just been sentenced to six years in prison.

From house arrest, he publicly announced their split and said he had married another woman, posting a photograph of the two on what he said was their wedding day. How he did all that while under arrest was not explained.

“Why should I leave?” he said on state television last week, looking thoroughly brainwashed. “It’s very good here, there are a lot of young people, everyone is walking, the birds are singing.”

The breaking of Pratasevich, who weeks before his arrest compared Lukashenko’s repressions to Hitler’s, has been a macabre display of the dictator’s power and desire for revenge.

“The goal of Lukashenko was simple and clear: to break the personality of Raman and make him the instrument, the tool of Lukashenko’s policy,” said Franak Viačorka, chief of staff to the exiled Belarusian protest leader Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, who knew Pratasevich in Vilnius before his arrest. “And he achieved it.”

Three years ago, Lukashenko appeared at the brink of ruin, as hundreds of thousands of demonstrators thronged downtown Minsk calling for him to go. To save his regime, the thuggish security services resorted to mass arrests and acts of brutality against ordinary Belarusians.

Now, with his enemies largely in prison or in exile, the ageing dictator has sought to make an example of Pratasevich.

While the Belarusian leader has appeared to be facing health difficulties recently, having difficulty speaking at public events and sporting a heavily bandaged arm, his control over the state apparatus seems firm.

Last week, he said Belarus had begun to take delivery of tactical nuclear weapons from Russia, raising the stakes for any future protest in the country.

“Lukashenko’s dream is for the Belarusian opposition to get on its knees and beg him for forgiveness and admit it has been politically defeated,” said Pavel Latushka, a former culture minister under Lukashenko, who joined the opposition and was a key figure in the 2020 protests. He now lives in exile in Warsaw.

He added, however, that he did not want to criticise Pratasevich too harshly. “It’s difficult to pass judgment on someone who has spent time in a Belarusian jail,” he said. “They’ll just kill him if he stops doing what they want.”

Latushka described Belarus’s crackdown as a “conveyor belt of repression”, and lamented that international focus on the country had waned even as the west united against the Kremlin for its full-scale invasion of Ukraine.

“There is no longer any discussion on Belarus. In the 21st century, a country is disappearing from the map of Europe. They even got tired of writing tweets about Belarus,” said Latushka.

Pratasevich is not the first staunch critic to emerge from prison singing a pro-regime tune.

The political scientist Yuri Voskresensky, who was jailed in 2020 after joining the presidential campaign of the opposition candidate Viktor Babariko, was released in October that year after a meeting between Lukashenko and political prisoners in jail. “We have the chance to democratise and we should take it,” he said at the time, claiming he believed Lukashenko was sincere in his desire for reform. He has since become another mouthpiece of the regime.

Like many others, Viačorka assumes Pratasevich may have been tortured, put in isolation and faced psychological manipulation during his time in a KGB prison, and “still is not free”.

But there are thousands of Belarusian political prisoners, he noted, and just a few have begun collaborating publicly with the regime.

“From the hero, he became an anti-hero. From a victim, he became a traitor,” he said. “For myself, I decided to think about two Raman Pratasevichs: one before Ryanair and one after Ryanair. After Ryanair, this Raman does not exist for me. A man who agreed to collaborate with the regime. The one before Ryanair is the one I respect.”

Friends who knew Pratasevich before his arrest painted a picture of a young and enthusiastic activist who was riding a wave of euphoria on the crucial role that he and colleagues played in the protest movement of 2020.

Jan Rudzik, a journalist, worked closely with Pratasevich during the 2020 protests, when they were both in Warsaw with Nexta, a Telegram channel that became instrumental in coordinating the protest movement.

At the height of the demonstrations, Nexta would direct crowds of thousands of protesters, in effect organising the mass demonstrations that seemed to threaten Lukashenko’s hold on power.

The Telegram channel also published big leaks, including the identities of 1,000 Belarusian riot police, meant to sow discord within the ranks of the authorities. “No one will remain anonymous, even under a balaclava,” the channel said.

“We became friends; he wanted to go out and make friends with everyone – he was almost a bit naive,” said Rudzik.

“He was giving lots of interviews, and it was obvious he enjoyed it. In the first interviews, he was saying: ‘We organised this, together with the Belarusian people’; then it became: ‘We organised this’; and before long it was: ‘I organised this,’” said Rudzik.

He said Pratasevich left Warsaw for Vilnius to work for another Telegram channel towards the end of 2020 after a partial falling out with the rest of the Nexta team. Still, he found Pratasevich’s recent transformation shocking.

“It’s very hard to fully understand what could have happened to him in there,” said Rudzik.

Now, as Pratasevich walks free and his former girlfriend remains in jail, his case stands as a symbol of the physical and psychological dangers of standing up to Lukashenko.

“He was brave, he was a real patriot, but unfortunately he didn’t have enough stamina to survive through all the challenges he faced in Minsk at the hands of the KGB,” said Viačorka.",‘I’m insanely thankful to the president’: how a Belarus dissident became an apologist for the regime,1

Already, dozens have been arrested over the January 6 riot, but the FBI is now looking at whether there was a deeper plot to kidnap or harm members of Congress, sources told the Washington Post.

'We're not looking at this as a grand conspiracy, but we are interested in learning what people would do with things like zip ties,' said one law enforcement official.

At least two mob members, one of them a retired Air Force officer, were spotted on the Senate floor carrying zip-tie handcuffs, while another was caught with a pistol on the Capitol grounds.

In pursuing the investigation, the FBI will be pouring through social media posts, emails and phones to determine whether anyone among the rioters made specific plans to harm lawmakers.

Although no senators or representatives were injured in the attack, federal prosecutors could still bring conspiracy charges if a plot were uncovered.

Such was the case recently in Michigan, where militia members were charged with plotting to kidnap Governor Gretchen Whitmer, a Democrat.

Among those who participated in the riot was an Air Force veteran who invaded the Senate floor and roamed Speaker Nancy Pelosi's office dressed in combat gear and carrying zip-tie cuffs.

Retired Lieutenant Colonel Larry Rendall Brock Jr, 53, carried zip ties in the Capitol

Retired Lieutenant Colonel Larry Rendall Brock Jr, 53, admitted to being the man in the videos and photos inside the Capitol.

But he told The New Yorker he thought he was welcome to enter the US Capitol and claimed he 'found' the zip ties on the floor and merely picked them up so he could hand them in to a police officer.

The father-of-three, who now lives in Dallas, was pictured on the Senate floor Wednesday after the group had broken through barricades, pushed back law enforcement and sent lawmakers fleeing for safety.

Images show him wearing a combat helmet, body armor and a vinyl tag with the Punisher skull on - a symbol adopted by white supremacists and believers of conspiracy theory QAnon.

He carried zip-tie handcuffs and appeared to be speaking with fellow rioters, several of which were dressed in MAGA caps.

Brock, who was in the Air Force for more than two decades and now works for an aviation company, was also seen in footage, shot by ITV News, appearing to exit Nancy Pelosi's office - which was vandalized and looted in the chaos.

Brock's family members and a former Air Force comrade have painted a concerning picture of the veteran - one of a man who has become increasingly radical and been influenced by white supremacy in recent years.

Bill Leake, who worked alongside Brock in the Air Force for 10 years, told The New Yorker he had fallen out of touch with Brock because he had 'gotten extreme'.

He said Brock, who was nicknamed Torch in the force, became obsessed with Trump and with following 'the alternative-news-source world'.

'Torch got all in on Trump. He went all in on the alternative-news-source world,' said Leake.

'He actually believes liberals and Democrats are a threat to the country. You can see how the logical conclusion to that is, ""We've gotta take over"".'

Investigators will also consider whether there was any concerted plot targeting Vice President Mike Pence, who enraged Trump and his loyalists by refusing to illegally intervene in Congress to overthrow the election.

As the attack unfolded, Trump took to Twitter to vent fury at Pence, a message that quickly spread among the president's followers at the Capitol.

A Reuters' photographer covering Wednesday's riot claimed he heard at least three Trump supporters speak about hanging Pence from a tree as a 'traitor'.

'Many more were just talking about how the VP should be executed,' tweeted Jim Bourg, the Reuters News Pictures Editor in DC.

Pictures from D.C. on Wednesday revealed that a noose was erected on a wooden frame on the West Front of the Capitol by the president's mob.

Rioters were also spotted stalking the halls of the Capitol chanting 'Where is Pence? Where is Pence?'

The FBI now has agents in all 56 field offices nationwide pursuing leads related to the attack.

'Just because you've left the DC region, you can still expect a knock on the door if we find out you were part of criminal activity in the Capitol,' said Steven M. D'Antuono, head of the FBI's Washington Field Office.

On Friday, the FBI released new photos of 10 additional MAGA mob rioters inside the Capitol who are wanted in relation to the violent siege.

Federal authorities are seeking the public's help in tracking down those pictured for making 'unlawful entry' into the Capitol building.

The protesters were riled up by Trump, Giuliani and Donald Trump Jr. during a rally near the White House and told to head to Capitol Hill where lawmakers were scheduled to confirm Biden's presidential victory.

A violent mob stormed the Capitol, breaking through police barricades and smashing windows to enter the building.

Lawmakers were forced to go into hiding for several hours as Capitol police grappled to take back control while the mob defecated in the Senate and House, invaded Nancy Pelosi's office and looted items potentially including state secrets.

One female Trump supporter, US Air Force veteran Ashli Babbitt, was shot dead by Capitol Police as she tried to climb through a window.

In its request, the House select committee said McCarthy had previously described a 'very heated conversation' with the president as the bloody events unfolded.

And it pointed to media reports that he also told other Republicans that Trump had admitted ‘some degree of responsibility’ for the attack.

The request seeks information about his conversations with the president 'before, during and after' the riot as lawmakers try to understand Trump's motivations.

The panel has already interviewed about 300 people and issued subpoenas to more than 40 as it seeks to create a comprehensive record of the Jan. 6 attack.

'You have acknowledged speaking directly with the former President while the violence was underway on January 6th,' wrote its chairman Bennie Thompson to McCarthy.

The House Jan 6 committee has asked GOP leader Kevin McCarthy for his cooperation, citing his 'very heated conversation' with President Trump as the violence unfolded

Committee chairman Bennie Thompson wrote to McCarthy on Wednesday asking for help with various topics, including his conversations with the president 'before, during and after' the riot

Thompson told reporters he would consider a subpoena if McCarthy declined his request

He went on to point out that McCarthy himself had said publicly that the president bore responsibility.

'Further, you shared an account of your communications with President Trump with a local news outlet in your district, which reported that you had a “very heated conversation” with the President as the riot was taking place, and urged the President to “get help” to the Capitol,' wrote Thompson.

'Many similar reports appear on and after January 6th from a number of other news organizations.

'And, in addition to all of those published accounts — which each appear consistent with your public statements at the time — Politico reported that you shared an even greater degree of detail with your colleagues in a widely attended conference call on January 11th.

'On that call, according to the report, you stated that President Trump had admitted “some degree of responsibility” for January 6th in his one-on-one conversations with you.'

McCarthy is the third member of Congress the committee has approached for voluntary information.

GOP Reps. Jim Jordan and Scott Perry have rejected the requests. Jordan dismissed the committee as 'illegitimate.'

Thompson told reporters he would consider issuing a subpoena if McCarthy did not comply voluntarily.

The committee has already issued dozens of subpoenas to try to get those close to the former president to testify about the days leading up to the Capitol riot.

The panel has already interviewed about 300 people and issued subpoenas to more than 40 as it seeks to create a comprehensive record of the Jan. 6 attack

On Tuesday, Thompson said that he was also looking to speak to Trump's personal attorney Rudy Giuliani.

'He's an integral part of whatever happens,' he said.

At the same time the House committee subpoenaed Andy Surabian, Arthur Schwartz - both advisers to Donald Trump's son Don Jr - and Ross Worthington, a staffer who the committee said wrote part of the president's speech on Jan 6.

Steve Bannon, Trump's former chief strategist, was indicted on contempt of Congress charges after refusing to comply with the committee's subpoena, and his trial is now set to being July 18.

The committee's members have said they will consider passing any evidence of criminal conduct by Trump to the U.S. Justice Department.

'Those arrested were part of a group of demonstrators who gathered outside the venue.'

The hand-written notes, released by a congressional committee, reveal how Trump how Trump told the heads of the top U.S. law enforcement agency they should pursue his claims of fraud and that President Biden had not really won the election – even as they pushed back on his wildest claims and scribbled won his musings and directives.

'Just say that the election was corrupt + leave the rest to me and the R. Congressmen,' Trump told then-Acting Deputy Attorney General Richard Donoghue of a December 27, 2020 phone call that also included Acting AG Jeffrey Rosen.

'Just say that the election was corrupt,' former President Donald Trump told top Justice Department officials, according to notes of a Dec. 27, 2020 converstaion

He was referring to Republican congressional allies in the Capitol who were putting forward his election fraud claims, according to the notes Donoghue took.

'These handwritten notes show that President Trump directly instructed our nation's top law enforcement agency to take steps to overturn a free and fair election in the final days of his presidency,' said House Oversight Committee Chairwoman Rep. Carolyn Maloney of New York, who is probing Trump's efforts.

The notes memorialize a phone call between Trump, identified as 'P,' and Rosen, identified as 'DAG.' He had assumed authority in the last weeks of Trump's term after Attorney General Bill Barr departed days earlier – after himself saying there was not evidence of widespread election fraud.

Rosen tried to tell the president there were limitations preventing him from giving the president what he wanted. The notes say: 'understand that the DOJ can't + won't snap its fingers + change the outcome of the election, doesn't work that way.'

'We have an obligation to tell people that this was an illegal, corrupt election,' according to notes on Trump call with DOJ officials

'These people who [are] saying that the election isn't corrupt are corrupt,' according to notes of the president's conversation with top DOJ officials

The notes on the Dec. 27, 2020 'DAG call' include Tump's claims of election fraud, reference Rep. Jim Jordan of Ohio,

Acting Deputy AG Richard P. Donoghue took notes on the call

The call came days after Acting AG Jeffrey Rosen took over leadership of the agency

It came days before the 'Stop the Steal' rally and the Capitol riot

That prompted Trump to say 'Don't expect you to do that,' and to just 'say' the election was corrupt.

Near the bottom of the nine-page notes, in quotation marks, is another line from Trump: 'We have an obligation to tell people that this was an illegal, corrupt election.'

Such a statement by the Justice Department might have provided fuel for various state audit and recount efforts being pushed by Trump and his allies, amid a flurry of litigation an Kraken lawsuits that were being tossed out of court.

It also would have bolstered Republican congressional allies, many of whom would ultimately vote not to certify electoral votes from states that certified their votes for Biden over Trump in states where Trump was claiming fraud.

The notes reveal that Trump rehashed many of the comments he and allies were making publicly, claiming fraud in Georgia, Arizona, and other states where Trump continues to make his claim.

Trump also appeared to threaten a leadership shakeup in his final days in office, suggesting he might put in the acting head of DOJ's civil division.

'People tell me Jeff Clark is great, I should put him in. People want me to replace DOJ leadership,' Trump said.

Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio), who Speaker Nancy Pelosi bumped off a select committee probing the Jan. 6th attacks, is also mentioned on the call. Trump calls him a 'fighter.'

Trump, who along with his allies put forward a string of claims about dead people voting and machines 'flipping' votes as part of his bid to stay in office, encouraged the officials to go online.

'You guys may not be following the internet the way I do,' he said.

DOJ this week told former government officials they can speak to congressional committees probing the Jan. 6th Capitol riot – raising the likelihood that the officials on the call will be called to testify about the conversation with Trump.

The officials also memorialized their own efforts to pushback at Trump, at a time of chaotic maneuverings inside the agency.

'Told him flat out that much of the info he is getting is false, +/or just not supported by the evidence – we look at allegations but they do not pan out,' the notes said.

Another line shows Trump urging an investigation of the president's son, Hunter. Trump's recorded request with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky seeking a probe of the Bidens were critical to the first unsuccessful impeachment effort in Congress.

It came following revelations Trump allies said came from Hunter Biden's laptop.

The 6-3 decision could upend hundreds of cases stemming from the January 6 riot, including Donald Trump's election fraud trial.

The court's ruling makes it harder for January 6 defendants to be charged with obstructing an official proceeding - which carries up to 20 years in prison.

That is among the four charges facing former President Donald Trump in Special Counsel Jack Smith's federal case.

The decision is poised to upend hundreds of cases stemming from the January 6 riot, including Donald Trump 's election fraud trial

At least 152 people have been convicted of obstructing an official proceeding, according to the Associated Press, a crime punishable by up to 20 years in prison.

In all, the charge has been brought against about 350 people accused of trying to prevent Congress certifying Joe Biden's 2020 election victory.

The case was brought by former Boston police officer Joseph Fischer who was indicted on seven charges following the 6 riot including one count for anyone who 'corruptly ... obstructs, influences and impedes any official proceeding.'

Justice John Roberts, who wrote the opinion Friday, limited the 'obstruction of Congress' charge that has been used by the federal government to prosecute January 6 defendants.

Roberts called that law - which carries a 20-year prison sentence - 'one of the more severe potential punishments.'

A broad interpretation of the law 'would also criminalize a broad swath of prosaic conduct, exposing activists and lobbyists to decades in prison,' Roberts continued.

On average, the sentence for obstruction for those rioters already found guilty was 28 months, according to a Washington Post database.

Justices Elena Kagan and Sonia Sotomayor dissented - and were joined by Justice Amy Coney Barrett.

Attorney General Merrick Garland said he was 'disappointed' by the court's decision.

It 'limits an important federal statute that the Department has sought to use to ensure that those most responsible for that attack face appropriate consequences,' said Biden's top law enforcement official.

A lower court dismissed the charge after Fischer's lawyers argued he did not try to interfere with any documents or records.

Federal prosecutors appealed and a three-judge panel on the D.C. circuit reinstated the charge.

Trump faces four charges brought by the special counsel: Conspiracy to obstruct an official proceeding; obstruction of and attempt to obstruct an official proceeding; conspiracy to defraud the United States; and conspiracy to deprive citizens of their voting rights.

Trump has pleaded not guilty to these charges, and to dozens more charges stemming from three other criminal prosecutions.

His trial has been pushed off until the Supreme Court rules whether he is immune from prosecution.

The decision comes as Trump is facing criminal charges in three criminal cases and has already been found guilty on 34 counts of falsifying business records in New York last month.

He is the first former president to ever be convicted of a crime.

At least 152 people have been convicted of obstructing an official proceeding, according to the Associated Press, a crime punishable by up to 20 years in prison

During oral arguments where some wild hypotheticals were addressed, the justices appeared to reject granting presidents absolute immunity, but their line of questioning suggested they could delay Trump's trial as he runs for president for a third time.

Attention-seeker George O'Boyle, 30, led a rabble of delinquents and wannabe 'influencers' on a fancy-dress invasion of an Asda store - which turned into a violent mass brawl on July 22, 2021.

Father-of-two O'Boyle - who calls himself 'GeeMoney' on TikTok - was the ringleader behind the mayhem, which saw his gang live-stream their rampage through the Clapham Junction supermarket.

But the carnage turned bloody when O'Boyle's sidekick, Josh McDonald - a 33-year-old martial arts champion dressed as Spider-Man - kicked and punched defenceless Lauren Scott unconscious, in footage that appalled viewers on social media.

While O'Boyle - dressed as comedy star Ali G in a yellow tracksuit - launched into a violent attack of his own, punching the store's manager up to 15 times in the face as fighting spilled into the aisles.

Both so-called 'pranksters' were this week jailed, after admitting assault occasioning actual bodily harm, and violent disorder.

But as O'Boyle now begins his two-year stretch behind bars, MailOnline can reveal the shameless TikToker continued terrorising Asda workers while awaiting his day in court, posting more prank videos days after police arrested him and his gang.

Attention-seeker George O'Boyle, 30, was jailed for more than two years after assaulting workers at an Asda store in July 2021. But days his attack, the father-of-two posted a series of videos on TikTok showing him terrorising other Asda workers

In one video, posted 16 days after the incident at Clapham Junction Asda, O'Boyle was shown playing a pink guitar while standing on a till before he lept down and smashed up the musical instrument on the floor (pictured)

The pranks were posted just days after O'Boyle's kick-boxing pal Josh McDonald ignited fury after knocking out Lauren Scott in Asda in Clapham Junction, south-west London in July 2021 (pictured)

In one video, released on August 8, 2021 - less than three weeks after the notorious Asda video - the foul-mouthed 'muppet' was pictured standing on a till, screeching a song as he attempted to play a pink guitar. The video was watched 3,400 times.

The 30-year-old then shouts 'I want to be a singer, so I'm going to be a f***ing singer' before leaping off the till and smashing his guitar on the ground, sending flower and debris all over the store, as he yells incoherently and falls over.

A second video, released on the same day to his 88,500 TikTok fans, saw the prankster frying up two burgers on a camping stove in the middle of the aisle.

The defiant father of two ignored a female Asda worker as she pleaded with him to stop. 'I rule the roost in my kitchen, alright. Get outta my kitchen,' goads O'Boyle.

But it's not only Asda targeted by the 'dimwitted' father - he filmed stunts at a Greggs bakery and Morrisons in London, where he appears to taunt security staff as he walks out of the store, dressed as a nun, with a crate of beer hidden in his dress.

Boyle even went as far as to boast to his followers that 'supermarkets are my playground', as he desperately attempted to build his fame.

While in another baffling video, he is filmed gatecrashing a corner shop and even a magistrates' court to hoover the floors as he 'paid back to the community'.

However, people online took a dim view of his 'gags', branding the stunts 'pathetic', 'embarrassing' and 'just not funny'.

Father-of-two George O'Boyle - who calls himself 'GeeMoney' online - was the ring leader behind the Asda 'prank'

'What an absolute clown doing stuff like that at your big age trying to be funny by disturbing people who are at work isn’t a good look,' wrote one user, with another saying: 'What a muppet.'

In a scathing critique, another TikTok user added: 'You've got to be the most unfunny person ever who tries to be funny.'

While after watching a video of him hoovering a bowling alley, a third person wrote: 'Literally [the] most unfunny thing I've ever seen.'

And although he has amassed a sizeable following of about 88,000 people on TikTok with his antics, his attempts to become a YouTube star have fallen embarrassingly flat, with his videos notching up just a handful of views.

Since footage of his 'Live Madness Replays' gang's Asda attack went viral in 2021, parents on TikTok said they no longer allow their children to watch his content, in yet another blow to the desperate father's hopes to be famous.

The mob, several of whom were from the same martial arts club, were seen beating male and female members of Asda staff in the aisles and stock room before turning on terrified shoppers, some of whom were knocked to the ground.

The ringleaders had posted an advert online, welcoming all-comers, and saw a nun, a spaceman, a soldier and a human fly also turn up to cause carnage when lockdown restrictions remained in place.

Three of the six suspects came to London from Northampton, the other three were from south-west and west London.

As well as causing mayhem in shops with is bizarre pranks, O'Boyle also recorded himself carrying out stunts on the high street (pictured)

Other prank videos, which have been branded 'pathetic' by social media users, involved him smashing his face into a pie or drenching it with tomato sauce (pictured)

The 33-year-old father-of-two, who trained at the Black Dragon Martial Arts Academy near his home in Northampton, had boasted online that he was a contender for the 'Iska kickboxing world championship' in 2016 in Stuttgart, Germany.

The kickboxing teacher, who is also a black belt in mixed martial arts, appeared at Kingston Crown Court on Tuesday, where he was sentenced to six years and six months in prison.

McDonald also admitted wounding with intent in an unrelated incident in which his smashed a glass over a man's head – in Northampton town centre in daylight – then slashed him with a shard he picked up from the ground.

What had been billed as a fun stunt became ever more violent - with multiple Asda staff beaten with metal bars, punched, kicked, and left bloodied after the mob burst into the shop's storeroom.

When supervisor Lauren Scott remonstrated with Sophie Roberts, 19, dressed as Little Red Riding Hood as she rampaged back on to the shop floor, the teenager - also a kickboxer and who trained at the same academy as McDonald - punched her in the face.

As Miss Scott tried to defend herself, McDonald marched over in his Spider-Man costume and high-kicked and punched her unconscious, before proudly stalking off.

McDonald, of Northampton, was jailed for six years and six months, and will be monitored for a further three years and six months because he is considered a danger to the public, 'with problematic attitudes to masculinity'.

O'Boyle, of Surbiton, south-west London, who had told online followers that 'supermarkets are my playground', was jailed for two years and two months for being 'a leader of the mayhem'.

O'Boyle (pictured in yellow Ali G costume), repeatedly threatened to punch staff as he led the crowd of his online 'followers', similarly in costume, into the supermarket

His barrister Kerry Moore told the court in mitigation that the Asda riot was 'an inconsiderate, juvenile, idiotic stunt, the aim to jokingly throw a party in the aisles that night' and it had got out of hand.

Sophie Roberts, 19, McDonald's step-daughter, an unemployed mother of two from Northampton who was dressed as 'Little Red Riding Hood', is to be sentenced next month for hitting Ms Scott in the face and threatening behaviour.

Rikki McKenzie, 36, of Northampton, who pretended to be Matt Lucas's faux-disabled character Andy from TV show Little Britain, was given a suspended sentence for threatening behaviour.

The court heard the one-legged amateur boxer had used his wheelchair as a weapon before frustrated staff beat him with bags of ice and pulled him to the floor.

As staff struggled to force him out of the shop, he fell from his wheelchair.

Mark Pettigrew, 38, from west London, had joined the Asda mayhem dressed in uniform as 'Army Man', and was involved in an attack on two workers. He was not present in court, but the judge was told he admitted public disorder with violent threats.

O'Boyle's girlfriend and mother of his two children, Katie Pickard, 31, from south London, had been dressed as a nun while Charlie Jay Sharp, 19, from Northampton, had gone to the supermarket as 'Onesie Girl' in a purple onesie.

O'Boyle staged the event for his tens of thousands of followers on TikTok and Instagram. A large number of the group were videoing the store invasion and live-streaming it straight on to the internet.

O'Boyle's barrister, Kerry Moore, insisted at Kingston Crown court that he had simply planned 'to have some fun for social media entertainment'.

Jailing the ring-leaders, who had arrived at Asda in a stretch limousine, Judge Mark Bryant-Heron told McDonald: 'You completely lost control, and attacked a woman, a member of staff in her workplace, and hit her in the face and drop-kicked her to the floor as she retreated from you.'",TikTok joker jailed for attacking Asda worker in sick prank film more stunts days after his arrest,1

Andy Marsh will not seek to extend contract when it expires at beginning of July

The Chief Constable of Avon and Somerset Police will quit this summer amid backlash over the force's handling of Black Lives Matter and 'Kill the Bill' protests.

Andy Marsh, who has spent 34 years on the force, will not seek to extend his contract when it expires at the beginning of July, saying it was a 'difficult decision to make'.

The force has come under fire for being too heavy-handed in its response to the recent 'Kill the Bill' protests in Bristol when violence broke out during demonstrations against the government's proposed Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Bill.

Senior officers were also criticised for failing to intervene to stop Black Lives Matter protesters dumping a statue of slave trader Edward Colston into Bristol Harbour last summer.

In a statement issued on Wednesday, Mr Marsh said it had been the 'honour of a lifetime' to lead the force he first joined in 1987 and that it would be a 'wrench' to leave the job.

He said: 'To leave a force I first joined in 1987 has been a difficult decision to make, but I feel it is the right time for me to embark on a new challenge and for another person to take the helm and continue on the journey to make Avon and Somerset Police the outstanding force it deserves to be.'

Mr Marsh, who is married with two daughters, joined Avon and Somerset Police as a new recruit in 1987, working his way up to the rank of chief superintendent.

He took the job of Chief Constable at Avon and Somerset in February 2016, after serving as Assistant Chief Constable at Wiltshire Police and Chief Constable at Hampshire Constabulary, which under his lead became the first police force in England to be personally equipped with body-worn video.

He was appointed as the National Police Chiefs' Council (NPCC) policing lead for body-worn video in 2014 and was awarded the Queen's Police Medal, presented for gallantry or distinguished service, in 2018.

Mr Marsh's personal achievements include being a rowing silver medal winner in the Barcelona 2003 World Police and Fire Games alongside undertaking a 15,000ft parachute jump to raise funds for the national UK Police Memorial in 2018.

He is a 'dedicated football fan' and enjoys running, rowing and fly-fishing, according to Avon and Somerset's website.

The force's police and crime commissioner Sue Mountstevens said: 'Andy Marsh has been an outstanding chief and has led his team with courage through some particularly challenging times for policing – including austerity and the Covid-19 pandemic.'

In recent weeks, Bristol has seen unrest following Kill the Bill protests against Government plans to give police sweeping powers to control demonstrations.

Force bosses were also criticised for failing to intervene to stop Black Lives Matter protesters throwing a statue of slave trader Edward Colston into Bristol Harbour (above) last summer

Police with shields and helmets hold back people outside Bridewell Police Station in Bristol on Sunday, March 21

A riot broke out on March 21 when around 500 people marched on Bridewell police station, set fire to police vehicles and attacked the station, and protests on March 23 and 26 also ended with clashes between activists and officers.

Following the demonstrations, Bristol West Labour MP Thangam Debbonaire said she was speaking to people who claimed officers were too forceful.

She said: 'This is absolutely unacceptable.

'The scenes of violence and direct attack on the police in Bristol city centre will distress most people including anyone who believes in defending the right to peaceful democratic protest.'

Mr Marsh defended breaking up crowds during the 'Kill the Bill' protests, saying it was 'what our communities expected us to do' under lockdown regulations.

John Apter, national chairman of the Police Federation of England and Wales, added at the time: 'This is not about protecting the right to protest, it's violent criminality from a hardcore minority who will hijack any situation for their own aims.

'My colleagues, some of whom are now in hospital, face the brunt of that hatred. Thoughts remain with my colleagues.'

A spokesman for Avon and Somerset Police further stated: 'Officers have had projectiles thrown at them, including a firework, and have been verbally abused.

'This is unacceptable behaviour and those responsible for offences will be identified and brought to justice.'

The Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Bill, introduced to the Commons this month, would give officers in England and Wales more power to impose conditions on non-violent protests, including those deemed too noisy or a nuisance.

Those convicted under the proposed legislation could face a fine or jail. The Bristol protesters were carrying signs reading 'say no to UK police state' and 'freedom to protest is fundamental'.

Police had advised people not to attend the protest due to coronavirus legislation, which bans mass gatherings.

Mr Marsh also spoke out on the force's tactics when officers failed to intervene to stop the Colston statue being damaged.

He said that trying to arrest the activists would have resulted in 'a very violent confrontation'.

'You know, the fact that people think that government, ehhh, you know, doesn't really even do anything and I'm like, ""oh my God, does government do everything for us,""' she continued. 'And we cannot take this democracy for granted. And sometimes I worry that we do.'

Before mentioning the 2024 election, Obama said she also feared war in 'too many regions,' artificial intellgience, climate change, education and people spending too much time on theri phones.

'Are people going to vote and why aren't people voting?' she also said.

'I mean those are the things that keep me up,' Obama said.

Her status as a former first lady, she said, also made her worry more.

'There's such a thing as knowing too much,' Obama said. 'And when you've been married to the president of the United States who knows everything about everything in the world, sometimes you just want to turn it off.'

'I don't want to know what was in that folder that you just got that made you quiet, you know? I don't want to know why the security just pulled you over,' she continued. 'I mean it could be any range of things that comes across the desk of the leader of the free world, right? So I know a lot about what's going on and what keeps me up are the things that I know.'

Since departing the White House in 2017, Obama said she's taken up knitting - a pandemic-era hobby - and has gotten into tennis to quiet her mind.

'I've developed habits that shut my brain off to thinking,' she said.

'Learning something physical shuts my mind down,' she noted, pointing to her efforts to play tennis. 'Nothing shuts my mind down like running after a green ball.'

Michelle Obama's 2024 election worries come after The Washington Post reported Saturday that former President Barack Obama attended an off-the-books lunch with Biden in recent months and grew 'animated,' warning the president that his campaign needed to kick it into high gear to deal with the threat of Trump.

Trump has been out-polling his Republican rivals in the GOP primary and is ahead of the Democratic president in a number of key swing state polls.

Biden took his first big swipe at Trump in 2024 by delivering remarks Friday from Valley Forge, Pennsylvania, a crucial location in the Revolutionary War.

The president warned that Trump represented a threat to democracy, a day before the third anniversary of the Capitol riot.

'Donald Trump's campaign is obsessed with the past not the future. He's willing to sacrifice our democracy, put himself in power,' Biden said.

Trump shot back at a campaign rally Friday night in Iowa, telling his supporters that Biden 'stuttered' through his January 6-themed speech.

'He's going bah bah bah he's a threat to democracy,' Trump said, mimicking Biden's childhood speech impediment.",Michelle Obama claims she is 'terrified' about the 2024 election result and it 'keeps her up at night': Former first lady echos Biden by saying democracy is at risk,1
https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jan/30/trump-pardon-promise-capitol-rioters-dictators-john-dean-nixon,1,"Donald Trump’s promise to pardon supporters who attacked the US Capitol on January 6 2021 was “the stuff of dictators”, Richard Nixon’s White House counsel warned.

Trump made the promise at a rally in Conroe, Texas, on Saturday.

“If I run and if I win,” he said, referring to the 2024 presidential election, “we will treat those people from January 6 fairly. We will treat them fairly. And if it requires pardons, we will give them pardons because they are being treated so unfairly.”

More than 700 people have been charged in connection with the Capitol attack, around which seven people died as Trump supporters tried to stop certification of his election defeat, in service of his lie that it was caused by electoral fraud. More than 100 police officers were hurt.

Eleven members of the far-right Oath Keepers militia have been charged with seditious conspiracy. Trump himself was impeached for inciting the riot. Ten House Republicans voted to impeach but Trump was acquitted when only seven Republican senators found him guilty. That left him free to run for office again.

John Dean, 83, was White House counsel from 1970 to 1973 before being disbarred and detained as a result of the Watergate scandal, which led to Nixon’s resignation in 1974. Dean responded to Trump on Twitter.

“This is beyond being a demagogue to the stuff of dictators,” he wrote. “He is defying the rule of law. Failure to confront a tyrant only encourages bad behaviour. If thinking Americans don’t understand what Trump is doing and what the criminal justice system must do we are all in big trouble!”

Trump was generous with pardons in office, recipients including Steve Bannon and Michael Flynn, both now targets of the House committee investigating January 6 and with Trump in its sights. On Sunday morning, the New Hampshire governor, Chris Sununu, widely seen as a relative moderate in Trump’s Republican party, was asked if pardons should be offered to Capitol rioters.

“Of course not,” he told CNN’s State of the Union. “Oh, my goodness. No.”

Even Lindsey Graham, the South Carolina senator and dogged Trump ally, said the former president was wrong.

“I don’t want to send any signals that it was OK to defile the Capitol,” he told CBS’s Face the Nation. “I want to deter what people did on January 6, and those who did it, I hope they go to jail and get the book thrown at them because they deserve it.”

But a moderate Republican, Susan Collins of Maine, indicated the hold Trump has on the party.

Appearing on ABC’s This Week, the senator said Trump should not “have made that pledge to do pardons. We should let the judicial process proceed.”

But Collins, who voted to convict Trump over the Capitol attack, would not say that she would not support him if he ran for president again.

“Well certainly it’s not likely given the many other qualified candidates that we have, that have expressed interest in running,” she said. “So it’s very unlikely.”

Trump dominates polling concerning potential Republican nominees for 2024.

Others deplored Trump’s words in Texas. Richard Painter, a White House ethics counsel under George W Bush, said the promise of pardons should, constitutionally speaking, stop Trump running again.

“This alone is giving aid or comfort to an insurrection within the meaning of the 14th amendment, section three,” Painter wrote. “Trump is DISQUALIFIED from public office.”

Trump also complained about investigations of his business and political affairs which have landed him legal jeopardy. On Sunday, Graham, whose actions in support of Trump are being investigated in Georgia, said he would cooperate if asked.

“Yeah,” he said. “Give me a call.”

But he also complained about a supposed “effort here to use the law, I think inappropriately. So I don’t know what they’re going to do in Fulton county [Georgia]. I don’t know what the January 6 committee is going to do. I expect those who defile the Capitol to be prosecuted. But there’s a political movement using the law to try to knock Trump out of running. And I, particularly, don’t like it or appreciate it.”

In Texas, Trump urged supporters to protest.

“If these radical, vicious, racist prosecutors do anything wrong or illegal,” he said, “I hope we are going to have in this country the biggest protests we have ever had in Washington DC, in New York, in Atlanta and elsewhere, because our country and our elections are corrupt.”

Prosecutors, he said, were “trying to put me in jail. These prosecutors are vicious, horrible people. They’re racists and they’re very sick. They’re mentally sick. They’re going after me without any protection of my rights by the supreme court or most other courts.”

Glenn Kirschner, a former federal prosecutor now a legal analyst for NBC, said: “Trump is not only encouraging his supporters to violence if he’s arrest[ed], he’s also signaling that he’ll pardon them, just as he’ll pardon the [January 6] insurrectionists.

“Will this finally move prosecutors to hold him accountable for his crimes?”",Nixon aide: Trump pardon promise for Capitol rioters is ‘stuff of dictators’,1

Chansley, who is better known as the 'QAnon Shaman' - became the poster boy for the January 6 insurrection with his chest-baring fur outfit, red white and blue face paint and megaphone.

Appearing on Carlson's 'Uncensored', Chansley claimed that he went to D.C. ensure that the 'highest possible frequencies of love and peace and harmony were plugged into the grid.'

Chansley, 35, was arrested on January 9 on federal charges of 'knowingly entering or remaining in any restricted building or grounds without lawful authority, and with violent entry and disorderly conduct on Capitol grounds.'

He initially pleaded guilty to the charges and was sentenced to 41 months, though he was released early on May 25, 2023.

Appearing on Carlson's 'Uncensored', Chansley claimed that he went to D.C. ensure that the 'highest possible frequencies of love and peace and harmony were plugged into the grid'

The QAnon Shaman has now told Carlson that he was simply fulfilling his religious duties by attending the Washington, DC, riots.

'I even played Donald Trump's video tweet over my megaphone and told everybody to go home,' he told Carlson.

'The whole reason why I went to DC was because Washington, DC, is built on electromagnetic ley lines. These are the the lines that go around the planet,' Chansley explained.

Carlson told is guest that his reputation stemmed partly from his crazy January 6 costume, which consisted of a fur hat with horns and red, white and blue face paint.

'One of the reasons it was so easy to call for your murderer and to arrest you and send you to prison is because you were dressed in facepaint and horns,' Carlson said - adding 'so it was kind of obvious that you were a nutcase.'

Chansley told Carlson that he has been dressing that was for years, not just for the January 6 riots.

'I am a spiritual activist. More than a political one,' he said.

'So I've been dressing that way for a long time. I largely take from what is like almost like the yoga shaman tradition, where they shock the cognitive system by addressing in a like elaborate fashion, and in doing so by shocking the cognitive system,' he explained.

Chansley believes that opting for bold fashion statements makes people 'more likely to absorb the information that the shaman brings to them.'

The information that he is trying to relay is that 'we are most certainly living in a social construct and a cultural paradigm that is based on misinformation.'

He explained that the regalia he wore on January 6 was 'not a costume' but instead a 'shamanic regalia' that has symbolism.

The coyote tail he wore is symbolic in the Navajo tradition of being 'the trickster' or 'the liar'. 'So I've got the tricksters by the tails. I'm wearing the trickster skin.'

All of his tattoos are shamanic tattoos - which he says are 'very well earned,' and compared them to how military members wear ribbons on their chest.

Chansley also told Carlson that Marjorie Taylor Greene and Paul Gosar were 'ghosted' when they tried to visit him at the Alexandria Detention Center.

During the interview on Carlson's 'Uncensored' Chansley repeatedly insisted that January 6 was a 'deep state set-up'.

'I understand the depths of government corruption and the mockingbird media's corruption,' he said - adding that he didn't take it personally because he knew all they had done was 'dehumanize' him.

The __ went on to explain the 'deep state' - which he described as a tyrannical government that has taken over the country and is forcing American citizens to comply.

Carlson praised Chansley for his explanation, insisting that he wasn't being 'patronizing,' despite being amazed and shocked by the QAnon shaman's basic explanation.

Him being shirtless with a horned headdress saw him stand out from other rioters who stormed the Capitol

In November, Chansley said he was interested in running for Congress. The 35-year-old filed a statement of interest indicating he wants to run for the seat that will be vacated by the retirement of Rep. Debbie Lesko, R-Ariz.

Chansley pleaded guilty to a felony charge of obstructing an official proceeding in connection with the Capitol insurrection.

He made a heartfelt apology in the January 6 case, saying 'I deeply regret and am very sorry I entered into the Capitol Building on January 6, 2021. I should not have been there. Period. I was wrong. Period.'

His attorney Albert Watkins described Chansley as 'vulnerable to propaganda' and said 'Mr. Chansley, a long avowed and practicing Shaman, has repudiated the ""Q"" previously assigned to him and requests future references to him be devoid of use of the letter ""Q"".'

During his trial, Chansley was described by prosecutors as 'the public face of the Capitol riot.'

Him being shirtless with a horned headdress saw him stand out from other rioters who stormed the Capitol.

He was sentenced to 41 months in prison in November 2021 and served about 15 months before being transferred to a Phoenix halfway house in March 2023. He was released two months later in May.

The January 6 rioter has since changed his tune and said in July 2023 that he wants his pela reversed, adding that he never 'denounced Q or the QAnon community.'

https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jul/25/ecuador-prison-state-of-emergency-hostages-killings,1,"Ecuador’s president, Guillermo Lasso, has declared a 60-day state of emergency throughout the country’s prisons and authorized the armed forces to retake control of jails, following violence in the country’s most notorious prison that left 18 dead and a string of protests in which inmates took nearly 100 guards hostage.

The measure – the second state of emergency that Lasso has ordered in less than 24 hours – will be in effect for 60 days and orders the immediate mobilization of the military and police in an effort to regain control of the prisons.

Clashes – including gunfire and explosions – between organized criminal gangs have raged since Saturday at the Penitenciaría del Litoral prison in the city of Guayaquil.

“So far the death of 18 prisoners has been confirmed after the clashes registered since Saturday,” the prosecutor’s office tweeted on Tuesday, adding that more than 10 people, including one police officer, were injured during the incidents.

The Penitenciaría del Litoral has a capacity for about 9,500 inmates, but in the first quarter of this year exceeded that number by almost 3,000.

It is considered one of the most dangerous prisons in Ecuador. A gang battle in 2021 killed 119 inmates. In April, 12 inmates were killed and three injured during a riot.

Meanwhile, prisoners in 13 other prisons declared a hunger strike on Monday and are holding 96 prison guards hostage to demand better sanitary conditions and food, among other issues.

Ecuador has long been plagued by prison violence, with this latest surge taking place amid campaigning for elections scheduled for 20 August, pushing some presidential candidates to pledge prison reforms, including electronic surveillance systems and more prison officers.

The SNAI prison authority has worked to regain control of the prison since early Tuesday, it said in a posting on the social media platform X, previously known as Twitter, which was accompanied by images of heavily equipped police and military entering the Penitenciaría del Litoral.

Military intervention in Ecuador’s prisons will continue until control has been retaken and there is no threat to prisoners or officials, the government said on Tuesday.

Lasso also declared a state of emergency in the provinces of Manabí and Los Ríos, as well as in the city of Durán on Monday, after the mayor of the city of Manta, Agustín Intriago, was shot dead on Sunday.

Lasso has regularly declared states of emergency in the country’s prisons as he tries to tackle violence which has surged since 2021, claiming the lives of hundreds of prisoners.

The prison system has faced structural problems for decades, prompting concern from the United Nations and the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights.",Ecuador declares prison emergency as inmates killed and guards taken hostage,1

Daunte Wright was fatally shot by Brooklyn Center Police Officer Kimberly Potter on Sunday after he was pulled over for what police said were expired license plate tags.

Police said a struggle broke out when they tried to arrest Wright after running his name and realizing he had an outstanding warrant.

Authorities have not confirmed the nature of the warrant but court records show Wright was being sought after failing to appear in court last month on misdemeanor charges that he fled from officers and possessed a gun without a permit during an encounter with Minneapolis police last June.

Daunte Wright's parents Katie and Aubrey said they could not accept their son's death was a mistake after police revealed Brooklyn Center Police Officer Kimberly Potter accidentally fired her gun instead of her taser

His aunt has said the warrant was for marijuana possession.

The city's police chief on Monday described the shooting as 'an accidental discharge' and said the veteran officer had mistakenly fired her gun instead of a taser.

In an interview with Good Morning America on Tuesday, Wright's parents Katie and Aubrey said they could not accept their son's death was a mistake.

'I cannot accept that. I lost my son, he's never coming back. I can't accept a mistake, that doesn't even sound right,' Aubrey said.

'This officer has been on the force for 26 years.'

Wright's mother added that she wants Potter to be held accountable for 'everything she's taken from us'.

His aunt, Naisha Wright, had earlier called for Potter to be jailed for 'not knowing the difference between a fully loaded pistol and a taser'.

Police body cam footage of the fatal incident showed three officers approaching Daunte Wright's car in Brooklyn Center on Sunday after he had been pulled over for the traffic stop

Potter could be heard shouting 'Taser!' several times in the moments before she fired her gun. Immediately after, she can be heard saying: 'I shot him'. It appears she dropped her gun in the aftermath

'Accident? An accident? No, come on now! I own a 20,000 volt taser. They don't feel nothing like a gun,' she told CNN. 'My family's blood is on their hands.'

Naisha has denied that her nephew's license plate tag was expired, as police have said. She also said a misdemeanor warrant that was out for her nephew was 'just for some weed'.

Wright's shooting death has sparked violent protests and unrest in the city that is already on edge because of the trial of Derek Chauvin, the first of four police officers charged in George Floyd's death.

Protests also broke out overnight in New York, Los Angeles, Washington DC, Portland and Seattle.

The unrest continued for a second night just hours after the Hennepin County medical examiner ruled Wright's death as a homicide and said the cause was a gunshot wound to the chest.

It came after Brooklyn Center Police Chief Tim Gannon held a tense press conference on Monday afternoon where he said 'an accidental discharge' appeared to be the cause of Wright's death.

Wright was shot dead on Sunday afternoon after he and his girlfriend were pulled over during a traffic stop for what police say was an expired car registration.

A Dollar Tree store that was looted has its sprinklers turned on. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz had announced a curfew from 7 p.m. Monday until 6 a.m. Tuesday for the three counties that include Brooklyn Center, Minneapolis and the capital of St. Paul. But hundreds of protesters defied that order and were seen gathered in the city Monday evening

The officers then learned Wright, who has a toddler son, had the outstanding warrant against him.

Gannon released footage of the incident from Potter's bodycam that showed her and two other officers approaching Wright's car after he had been pulled over for the traffic stop.

The footage showed one officer trying to handcuff Wright as a second officer told him he was being arrested on a warrant. Wright immediately jumped back into his car in an apparent attempt to flee.

A struggle then broke out between the officers and Wright, who was still sitting inside his car.

'I'll Tase you! I'll Tase you! Taser! Taser! Taser!' Potter could be heard shouting in her bodycam video.

Immediately after, Potter can be heard saying: 'Holy sh*t. I shot him'.

Wright managed to drive several blocks before coming to a stop when he hit another car. He was pronounced dead at the scene and his girlfriend, who was a passenger in the car, sustained non-life-threatening injuries.

'This was an accidental discharge that resulted in a tragic death of Mr Wright,' Gannon said.

'As I watch the video and listen to the officer's commands, it is my belief that the officer had the intention to deploy their taser, but instead shot Mr Wright with a single bullet.

The Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension is the agency investigating Wright's death.

Potter has been placed on administrative duty.

Brooklyn City Mayor Mike Elliott said during the press conference that the officer should be fired.

'My position is that we cannot afford to make mistakes that lead to the loss of life of other people in our profession,' Elliott said, adding he fully supported relieving the officer of her duties.

His comments were in contrast to City Manager Curt Boganey, who was in charge of the police department, after he said he wanted due process to play out before passing judgment on the officer's actions.

Boganey was fired by the town's City Council in an emergency meeting on Monday.

Elliott now oversees the police department.

Brian Peters, head of the Minnesota Police and Peace Officers Association, said Potter was working Sunday as a field training officer, training a new officer.

'She's just a very dedicated, passionate, good person. It's completely devastating,' he said. 'In a very tense moment, she made a mistake. It's not her character.'

Potter is a married mother of two, who was first licensed as a police officer in Minnesota in 1995 at age 22, according to state records obtained by the Star Tribune.

She has served on the city's negotiation team, and was among the first to arrive at the scene of another officer-involved shooting, in August 2019. In that case, Kobe Dimock-Heisler died after he allegedly rushed at officers with a knife in a home.

Potter instructed the two officers involved in the 2019 incident 'to exit the residence, get into separate squad cars, turn off their body worn cameras, and to not talk to each other,' according to an investigative report from the Hennepin County Attorney's Office, obtained by the paper. Both officers' actions were found to be justified and no charges were filed.

Potter has been a union president for her department's officers, the paper reported, and was a longtime member of the Law Enforcement Memorial Association.

Potter has two adult sons and lives with her husband, a former Fridley police officer, in a different Minneapolis suburb, the paper reported.

She had annual salary of $86,190, according to public records from 2018.

Ben Crump, a civil rights attorney who helped win a $27 million legal settlement for the Floyd family, is also representing the Wrights.

In a tweet, Crump said he believed that Potter 'knew exactly what she was doing' in a previous case which he said she told officers how to 'obscure accountability'.

He wrote about the previous incident involving Dimock-Heisler and Potter, saying she 'taught officers who fatally shot Kobe Dimock-Heisler how to protect themselves & obscure accountability'.

Crump, quoting a Hennepin County Attorney's Office report, wrote that Potter had previously instructed two police officers in the previous case to 'exit the residence, get into separate squad cars, turn off their body worn camera, and to not talk to eаch other.

'Of course Kim Potter knew exactly what she was doing. She knew how to obscure the truth. In that instance, her actions were clearly intentional,' he wrote.

Meanwhile, hundreds of protesters faced off against police in Brooklyn Center after nightfall on Monday hours after a dusk-to-dawn curfew was announced by the Minnesota Governor Tim Walz.

A drum beat incessantly and the crowd broke into frequent chants of 'Daunte Wright!'

When the protesters wouldn't disperse, police began firing gas canisters and flash-bang grenades, sending clouds wafting over the crowd and chasing some protesters away.

A long line of police in riot gear, rhythmically pushing their clubs in front of them, began slowly forcing back the remaining crowds.

'Move back!' the police chanted. 'Hands up! Don't shoot!' the crowd chanted back.

Law enforcement agencies had stepped up their presence across the Minneapolis area after Sunday night violence.

The number of Minnesota National Guard troops was expected to more than double to over 1,000 by Monday night.

A curfew was in place, but the protesters were determined to ignore it.

The police repeatedly tried to drive protesters away from the police headquarters, only for the crowd to scatter, then regroup.

By late Monday, only a few dozen protesters remained.

At a press conference at 12:30 a.m. on Tuesday, Minnesota State Patrol Col. Matt Langer said that 40 people had been arrested on Monday night at the Brooklyn Center protest, with some people being booked into the Hennepin County jail, while some were cited and released.

He added several officers suffered minor injuries from debris.

Wright's mother Katie Wright has previously described her son calling her in the moments before he was shot to say police had pulled him over for having air fresheners dangling from his rear-view mirror.

It is illegal in Minnesota to have anything hanging from a rear-view mirror.

She said he called her to get insurance information for the vehicle because she recently gave the car to him.

Describing the call, Wright's mother said: 'I said when the police officer comes back to the window, put him on the phone and I will give him the insurance information.

'Then I heard the police officer come to the window and say, 'Put the phone down and get out of the car.' And Wright said 'why'. He said, 'We'll explain to you when you get out of the car.''

'A minute later, I called and his girlfriend answered, who was the passenger in the car, and said that he'd been shot and she put it on the driver's side, and he was laying there lifeless,' Katie told gathered media on Sunday afternoon.

'I heard scuffling, and I heard police officers say, ""Daunte, don't run,""' she said through tears. The call ended, and she dialed his number again. His girlfriend answered and said he was dead in the driver's seat.

Speaking before the unrest broke out, Wright's mother had urged protesters to stay peaceful and remain focused on the loss of her son.

'All the violence, if it keeps going, it's only going to be about the violence. We need it to be about why my son got shot for no reason,' she said to a crowd near the shooting scene in Brooklyn Center.

'We need to make sure it's about him and not about smashing police cars, because that's not going to bring my son back.'

President Joe Biden was briefed on the shooting and the White House has been in touch with the governor, mayor and local law enforcement.

'We should listen to Dante's mom who is calling for peace and calm,' Biden said.

Biden then stressed that there is 'absolutely no justification for violence' in protest or otherwise.

'Peaceful protest is understandable. And the fact is that we do know that the anger, pain and trauma that exists in Black community in that environment is real, serious, and consequential. But that does not justify violence...'

On Monday, Vice President Kamala Harris also commented on the situation following Wright's death.

'Prayers are not enough,' she tweeted. 'Daunte Wright should still be with us. While an investigate is underway, our nation needs justice and healing, and Daunte’s family needs to know why their child is dead—they deserve answers.'",Squad member Rashida Tlaib calls for the ABOLISHMENT of police after Daunte Wright's death,1

Ashley Gaddie, 33, is about to spend his first night behind bars hours after a dramatic 12-hour stand-off with police on a precarious remote clifftop in the Blue Mountains ended with his arrest.

Gaddie was on the run from police for 48 hours after the body of Dannielle Finlay-Jones, 31, was found in the bedroom of a friend's home in Cranebrook in Sydney's west on Sunday, hours after she'd introduced him to friends at the pub.

Just seven years ago, Gaddie appeared as a doting father and boyfriend when posing for a family photo with Santa Claus and his ex-partner who held their baby son dressed in a Christmas costume.

The woman in the photo expressed devastation for Ms Finlay-Jones' loved ones as she tries to protect her young son from finding out his dad is an accused killer.

She claimed Gaddie lost interest in his only child when he was a toddler, and has had little to do with him since.

She added her son knew who his father was but hadn't seen him for years.

'I'm shaken up and devastated for that poor girl and her family. And trying to ensure my son doesn't see what his dad has (allegedly) done,' the protective mum told The Daily Telegraph said.

It comes as more details emerged about Gaddie, who lived in Five Dock in Sydney with his mum, where residents described him as polite.

'He was a friendly fellow … I assumed he lived there and took care of his mum,' a neighbour said.

'I got the shock of my life when the ninja police, you know, with guns, turned up here on Monday looking for him.'

Ashley Gaddie was on the run for 48 hours before police cornered him on a clifftop in the Blue Mountains on Tuesday afternoon in a stand-off that lasted 12 hours

Police rescue officers, detectives, riot squad and a team of specialist negotiators rushed to the Blue Mountains on Tuesday afternoon in a bid to talk Gaddie back to safety.

He was finally arrested just after midnight on Wednesday - after a 12 hour stand-off - as temperatures plunged to single figures on the bitterly cold clear night.

Gaddie was charged with the murder of Ms Finlay -Jones 12 hours later.

He launched a legal fight to stop DNA evidence being used against him when the case was heard was heard in Penrith Local Court.

Ms Finlay-Jones allegedly met up with Gaddie at The Marsden Brewhouse, in Marsden Park, on Saturday night after the pair recently met online

His lawyer Joseph Ormaechea opposed consent for the DNA swab taken at the police station by forensic experts.

The prosecutor warned of the need for the swab to be taken because of the 'transient' nature of the DNA.

Gaddie did not appear in person or by video link and made no application for bail.

He was remanded in custody until March 3 with a decision on the admissibility of the DNA swab adjourned also until that date.

Gaddie is to be transferred to Silverwater Jail on Wednesday night, where he will be processed and held on remand.

Ministers are locked in 'ongoing discussions' about lowering the legal threshold for the percentage of workers who must vote in favour of strikes for them to be legal, it emerged yesterday.

The move would involve repealing part or all of the Trade Union Act 2016, which states that strikes can only go ahead if 40 per cent of members approve on a turnout of 50 per cent.

The law was introduced under David Cameron to stop hard-Left union bosses holding the country to ransom with strikes only voted for by a fraction of members.

But Labour sources yesterday said it was the Government's 'intention' to repeal the 2016 Act.

The measures will give a 'green light' for strikes across the NHS , schools, ambulance service, Border Force, rail and fire services, critics said (Pictured, members of the BMA and Unite trade unions march around Royal London Hospital on October 4, 2023)

The talks involve Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner, a former trade union official

Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds is said to be pushing for a lower threshold

One insider added: 'There are ongoing discussions about what it (the thresholds) could be lowered to and how that would work. No one is proposing scrapping them completely.'

The talks involve Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner, a former trade union official, and Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds, with the former said to be pushing for a lower threshold.

The two-week notice period which unions must give for each strike is likely to remain in place.

The disclosure last night sparked fresh accusations that Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer's government was caving in to its union 'paymasters' and that it risks plunging Britain back into 1970s-style levels of militancy.

It came after Ms Rayner and Mr Reynolds wrote to Government departments yesterday announcing plans to repeal separate anti-strike laws introduced under Rishi Sunak.

They said that a new Employment Rights Bill will quash the Strikes (Minimum Service Levels) Act 2023 as part of a wider bid to 'reset industrial relations'. The legislation will be introduced after summer recess.

Union bosses lined up to hail the move. But critics fear it will embolden the unions and effectively give a 'green light' to call crippling strikes across the NHS, schools, ambulance service, Border Force, rail and fire services if pay demands aren't met.

Mr Sunak introduced the 2023 Act to force union bosses into providing a minimum level of services on strike days to limit their disruption to the public.

Kevin Hollinrake, the Tories' business spokesman, said: 'By surrendering to their union paymasters, Labour is showing who is really in charge.

'Labour is placing access to emergency care and schools staying open at risk to appease the unions.'

Former Tory leader Sir Iain Duncan Smith said: 'The unions are Labour's paymasters.

'If we're not careful, we're heading towards all the lessons learned in the 1970s being reversed.'

Labour has agreed to inflation busting pay hikes of 5.5 per cent for most public sector workers, at a cost of £9.4billion, and has offered junior doctors a 22 per cent increase. Train drivers could also be in line for a 10 per cent hike.

Ms Rayner and Mr Reynolds say officials should ignore the 2023 Act because it will soon be repealed by the Employment Rights Bill.

Labour's manifesto contained no mention of repealing the Trade Union Act 2016, but pledged to 'strengthen the collective voice of workers, including through their trade unions'.

Minneapolis Department Police Chief John Elder confirmed in a midnight press conference that one person was shot and killed and that another person was being held in custody.

Elder said officers had responded to reports of a possible stabbing at around 9.25pm between Bloomington and Lake Street.

The body of a man - who medics later confirmed had been shot - was found lying on the sidewalk outside the Cadillac Pawn shop by police officers who performed CPR on him.

Stores including Wendy's, Target, Walmart and AutoZone were looted, ransacked and some set alight before rioters tried to bust open an ATM, as many ignored pleas from the Floyd family's lawyer and Minnesota Governor Walz to protest peacefully Wednesday night.

Videos showed what was reported to be an apartment building entirely engulfed by flames as rioters stood and watched and the fire department was nowhere to be seen. An AutoZone store was also one of those which was set on fire.

Outside a GM Tobacco store, a group of four men with huge firearms were seen and said they had come to protect local businesses from looters,

During the riots, a woman in a wheelchair was punched in the head and sprayed with a fire extinguisher after trying to block protesters - allegedly with a knife in her hand.

Elder said that 'everything was done that we could do to try to preserve this man's life' but the adult male died in hospital.

The police chief refused to confirm reports that the shooter was the owner of the pawn shop who shot the victim dead because he was looting his store.

He said this was 'one theory' but that police are investigating 'a couple of different scenarios that might have happened'.

Elder would not divulge what the other scenarios are. He added that there had been no other reports of injuries among protesters or police officers.

The police chief also slammed the actions of looters and rioters which he branded 'disrespectful' to Floyd's family and to all the protesters who gathered peacefully to demand justice over his death.

'If people are there to truly honor the man and his family this isn't how you do it and it's so disrespectful and it's heartbreaking,' he said.

'People are utilizing this as a purpose just to make bad decisions.'

A source told KSTP that the city has requested support from the National Guard to bring the violence under control.

The looter who was shot dead was killed outside the Cadillac Pawn & Jewelry store. Looters broke into stores including Target, Autozone, Wendy's and Minnehaha Lake Wine and Spirits. The Minneapolis Police building was also damaged

News of the death topped off a night of chaos and destruction across the city as rioters stripped shelves bare, set fire to stores and tried to break into a bank.

Footage on social media showed car parts company AutoZone up in flames as people were seen hurling rocks through its windows.

Another structure, said to be a new apartment building, was filmed as flames entirely engulfed it and made it collapse.

With the fire department initially nowhere to be seen, reports on social media said they were being forced to stay away because of the violent rioters.

Stores and building near the fire were being splashed with water by citizens in an effort to stop the flames spreading. They were pictured filling buckets from fire hydrants.

Fire fighters were then seen spraying buildings including the Schooner tavern which had also caught fire.

At the Target store near the site of Floyd's arrest, the inside of the store lay in ruins, with stock depleted of all goods and the remaining merchandise flung across the floor.

Witnesses reported thieves using power tools to break open cash registers and trying to access the store's safes, before it too was set alight and seen engulfed in flames.

Rioters then turned to a Wendy's where they sprayed graffiti on the walls before moving onto a bank - trying to bust it open and raid the ATMs.

Police were seen wielding tear gas rifles and other weapons as they responded to the protests

A woman in a wheelchair was also punched in the head and sprayed with a fire extinguisher after trying to block protesters - allegedly with a knife in her hand.

The woman claimed she was 'peacefully protesting' to stop people from looting a Target store, but she was quickly set upon by a crowd who subdued her.

The crowd outside the Target store shouted that the woman had a knife, and footage showed her holding what appeared to be a sharp object.

Named online as Jennifer, she later said she had been 'punched in the head several times' before others tried to restrain her.

Footage of the violent clash has been widely shared on social media, including by conservative writer Andy Ngo.

A group of four men with huge firearms were seen outside a GM Tobacco store as they said they had come to protect local businesses from looters, reported Minnesota Reformer.

The vigilantes called themselves 'heavily armed rednecks' as they stood guard outside the businesses.

Disorder erupted in the streets of the city on the second day of the rally over Floyd's death, after footage emerged Tuesday showing white police officer Derek Chauvin kneeling on the black man's neck moments before he died in police custody.

Floyd is heard pleading with Chauvin, saying 'please, please, I can't breathe' and 'My stomach hurts. My neck hurts. Everything hurts' while witnesses urged the arresting officers to stop.

Cops were seen spraying pepper spray into the crowds and outraged Minnesotans threw metal railings at the windows of the police precinct as the two groups clashed on Wednesday.

This followed chaotic scenes at Tuesday night's protest where demonstrators were seen dousing their faces in milk to limit the effects of the tear gas and desperately fleeing the hail of rubber bullets raining down on them.

Protester falls from the hood of a moving police cruiser as violent Black Lives Matter demonstration breaks out in downtown Los Angeles A protester was thrown from the hood of a police cruiser in downtown Los Angeles on Wednesday night as a Black Lives Matter demonstration calling for justice for George Floyd turned violent. About 1,000 protesters descended on LA following the 46-year-old father-of-two died in Minneapolis Monday, moments after a white cop knelt on his neck for eight minutes until he passed out. As protests entered their second day in Minnesota, tensions began building between law enforcement and African-American communities across America, with demonstrators calling for the four officers involved in Floyd's death to be charged with murder. The first break-off protest sprung up in downtown LA Wednesday afternoon and quickly escalated into violence. Shocking aerial footage shows several protesters surrounding a California Highway Patrol cruiser and smashing its back windows on the 101 Freeway. One protester clambered on the hood before tumbling to the ground when the police officer drove off. The man was seen lying motionless on the ground and covered in blood, but he did regain consciousness and was taken to hospital in an ambulance. A second police cruiser that arrived at the scene was also attacked, had its windows smashed and was seen fleeing.

People carried signs reading ‘Black Lives Matter’. The group then made its way onto the 101 Freeway where they blocked cars along the road. The freeway was forced to shutter. By around 6.25pm local time, the crowd began moving off the freeway and continued moving through downtown LA streets, reported NBC Los Angeles. The protest came hours after Los Angeles Police Chief Michel Moore issued a statement condemning the video of Floyd's death as 'incredibly disturbing'.

Authorities claimed Tuesday that Floyd had resisted arrest by cops, however footage from the scene has cast doubt on the version of events as it appears to show the 46-year-old father of two cooperating with officers as he is manhandled out of his vehicle and placed in handcuffs outside the Cup Foods grocery store on 38th and Chicago Ave in south Minneapolis.

The release of the MFD report sheds yet more light on Monday's shocking events, detailing that fire crew were called to assist medics with a man - called 'pt' in the report - who had trauma to his mouth.

It states that Fire Station 17 of Minneapolis arrived at the scene outside the Cup Foods store to find 'multiple squads on scene and small crowd of citizens'.

The report points to confusion at the scene as neither the cops nor bystanders gave information to medics on Floyd or his location.

Protesters hold up their hands at the scene. An incident report from the Minneapolis Fire Department released Wednesday shows the fire department was called to reports of a man with trauma to his mouth and reached the scene to be told by witnesses that cops 'had killed the man'

It says that while the crew tried to find Floyd to give medical support, they overheard and were told by 'several people that the police ""had killed the man""'.

The report adds that the bystanders were 'upset but not unruly'.

Crew members were finally able to find a cop inside the store who told them medics had put Floyd in an ambulance and left the scene.

Crew members were also told by an off-duty firefighter who witnessed the end of the struggle that they had seen Floyd become unresponsive on the ground while handcuffed and subdued by cops, the report says.

Medics then called for assistance and the crew responded to the ambulance which had moved to 36th and Park Avenue.

Two crew members got into the ambulance where they found 'an unresponsive, pulseless male', the report states.

According to the report, medics never managed to recover a pulse on route to the hospital and Floyd's 'condition did not change'.

Governor Walz broke protocol in his daily coronavirus briefing Wednesday to talk about the 'tragic events' in Minneapolis Monday and to send his 'deepest sympathies' to Floyd's family.

'Like so many Minnesotans and so many people across the country and world I was shocked and horrified by the video of George Floyd's death,' the governor said.

'It's very clear to anyone that what happened to George Floyd is wrong,' Walz said.

'The lack of humanity in the video as I said made me physically ill and is even more difficult to understand.'

An autopsy has not yet been completed, officials said.

Walz thanked protesters for their peaceful rally Tuesday night - before making a thinly-veiled dig at law enforcement that some protesters ended up 'in harm's way' at the rally.

'When I was with you Saturday I closed by wishing everyone a peaceful Memorial Day,' Walz said.

'Unfortunately Memorial Day evening in Minneapolis was anything but peaceful - and neither was last night.'

Walz said he 'respect[s] the right to peacefully protest'.

'It's how people express their pain, process tragedy and work to create change,' he said.

'But I was saddened to see some of the protesters were in harm's way last night.'

A photo taken across the street from the scene show three officers arresting Floyd as he lay on the ground. The FBI and state law enforcement authorities have launched an investigation into the man's death

The victim's family's lawyer Ben Crump had also issued a statement urging protesters to act peacefully on Wednesday night and to not 'sink to the level of our oppressors'.

'The community is understandably and rightfully upset by the wrongful death of George Floyd at the hands of Minneapolis police officers, and their grief and outrage are pouring out onto the streets of Minneapolis. We share these painful emotions and demand justice, but we also urge everyone who wishes to raise their voice to engage in peaceful protests and observe social distancing,'

'We cannot sink to the level of our oppressors, and we must not endanger others during this pandemic. We will demand and ultimately force lasting change by shining a light on treatment that is horrific and unacceptable and by winning justice.'

Walz also urged protesters to wear face masks and practice social distancing at Wednesday's rally.

'I just want to encourage everyone to be safe in light of the COVID-19 pandemic and I want to thank protesters for their commitment to safely protest in the pandemic,' he said.

Minnesota Lt. Gov. Peggy Flanagan said the state will 'get answers' but also urged protesters to stay safe at the protests.

'George Floyd should be alive today,' she said. 'The grief in this moment is unbearable.'

Flanagan warned that the same communities most affected by Floyd's death are those also worst affected by the coronavirus pandemic - as black communities have been disproportionately hard-hit by the outbreak.

'Last night we saw those choose to protest their grief and anger wearing masks and distancing themselves,' she said, adding that she wanted to 'thank' those protesters.

Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison, also speaking at the press conference, said an investigation into Floyd's death is now underway.

Floyd, 46, was a father of two. His family are calling for the four officers involved to be charged with murder over his death

Ellison said the incident reminds him of historic cases of police conflict with the African-American community, such as the death of Rodney King back in 1991.

'This is not an isolated case,' he said. 'We're dealing with a systemic problem.'

'This tragic event that took the life of George Floyd is a point in time and an incident involving a person,' Ellison said.

'The reason there is so much outrage is that this is a part of a larger pattern.'

John Harrington, commissioner of the Minnesota Department of Public Safety, echoed sentiments from the victim's family's lawyer Ben Crump that there are worrying similarities in the case with the death of unarmed black man Eric Garner.

Garner died in 2014 after he was placed in a chokehold by New York City police and pleaded for his life, saying he could not breathe.

'It reminds me so much of the Eric Garner case in New York but I promise you that unlike the Eric Garner case we will not wait years for action,' he said.

'You will not have to wait - there will not be a lag.'

City officials on Wednesday formally identified the four fired police officers involved in Monday's incident as Derek Chauvin, Thomas Lane, Tou Thao, and J Alexander Kueng.

The cops, who were initially placed on paid administrative leave, were terminated from the Minneapolis Police Department on Tuesday after footage of Floyd's arrest was widely shared on social media.

Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey called on prosecutors Wednesday to arrest and charge Chauvin for his role in the incident.

'If most people, particularly people of color, had done what a police officer did late Monday, they'd already be behind bars,' Frey said in a tweet on Wednesday.

'That's why today I'm calling on Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman to charge the arresting officer in this case.'

REVEALED: White cop who knelt on George Floyd's neck was involved in a fatal police shooting and one of the other fired officers paid a $25K settlement after being sued for using excessive force in arrest where he punched and kicked a handcuffed suspect

Two of the cops fired over the arrest of black man George Floyd have already been investigated for their roles in previous use-of-force incidents, it has been revealed.

Derek Chauvin, 44, the officer filmed kneeling on Floyd's neck during his arrest, is a 19-year veteran of the force who was investigated over a fatal police shooting in 2006.

Now it's been revealed Chauvin was investigated for his role in the 2008 shooting of Ira Latrell Toles during a domestic assault call. Toles was wounded after police said he went for an officer's gun and Chauvin shot him.

Two years earlier Wayne Reyes, 42 was killed by officers after allegedly pulling a shotgun on the six cops, which included Chauvin, The Star Tribune reports.

And in 2011 23-year-old Leroy Martinez was shot and injured during a chase given by officers including Chauvin.

A second officer involved in Monday's arrest, Tou Thao, was part of a $25,000 out of court settlement after being sued for using excessive force in 2017.

In a lawsuit obtained by the DailyMail.com shows Thao was sued for using excessive force in arrest where he was accused of punching and kicking a handcuffed suspect 'until his teeth broke'.

The second officer, Thao, was sued in 2017 by Lamar Ferguson who said the cop had used excessive force during his arrest.

A lawsuit obtained by DailyMail.com states 'Defendant Thunder and Defendant Thao's use of unreasonable force on Plaintiff, in the form of punches, kicks, and knees to the face and body while Plaintiff was defenseless and handcuffed, was so extreme that it caused Plaintiff to suffer broken teeth as well as other bruising and trauma.'

The case was settled out of court for $25,000 after Thao said he had punched Ferguson after he 'actively resisted arrest'.

He wrote: 'After — at this point he's actively resisting arrest. He — so I had no choice but to punch him. I punched him in the face.'

All four officers were fired Tuesday. DailyMail.com has contacted Minneapolis police for comment and for the officers' full records with the department.

Chauvin is said to be represented by lawyer Tom Kelly. He was Jeronimo Yavez' attorney after the Minnesota police officer fatally shot Philando Castile during a traffic stop in 2016.

Yavez was found not guilty on all three charges by a jury in 2017.

The remaining two officers have been identified by the city as Thomas Lane and J Alexander Kueng.

Both were reportedly rookie cops who were still in their probationary periods, according to the StarTribune.",Protesters descend on the streets of Minneapolis for a second night over the death of George Floyd,1
https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2021/may/10/cali-colombia-protests-violence,1,"On a recent evening, Andrés pulled on his gas mask and helmet and headed for the barricades at the entrance to his rundown neighbourhood in Cali, a city which has become the center of Colombia’s anti-government protests.

But as he approached the roadblock of rocks, rubble and barbed wire, he saw a motorcycle speeding towards him. In an attempt to turn the vehicle back, another demonstrator shone a laser pen in the driver’s eyes.

Others screamed “the way is closed”, but still the bike wove past burning piles of rubbish towards the protesters.

Then, the masked pillion rider drew a handgun and opened fire.

“No one was hurt, thank God,” said Andrés, in the neighbourhood known as Puerto Resistencia. “But others will come.”

Cali is the focus of a nationwide wave of demonstrations against poverty and inequality exacerbated by the coronavirus pandemic.

But a string of incidents in which men in civilian clothing have brandished assault rifles and opened fire on protesters has prompted fears that the country – which is only just clawing its way out of war – is heading for broader conflict.

In the last 24 hours, indigenous protesters blocking roads have been shot at by assailants, fresh skirmishes have erupted between demonstrators and riot police, and residents have been trapped in their homes by clashes on the streets.

On Monday, Lucas Villa, a 37-year-old protester in the city of Pereira, was declared brain dead after being shot eight times by men in civilian clothing last week. Hours before the attack he had been filmed dancing at a march. Also on Monday, two police officers were arrested in connection with the death of Santiago Murillo, a 19-year-old protester who was shot dead on May 1 in the city of Ibagué.

“Armed civilians fighting against each other is one of the most serious manifestations of the crisis so far,” said Katherine Aguirre, a security expert at the Igarape Institute in Cali. “The state needs to find innovative ways to solve the crisis, both maintaining public order while pursuing dialogue at the local level.”

On Sunday night, Colombia’s president, Iván Duque, announced that more soldiers and police officers would be dispatched to the city to lift blockades. Chillingly, he also instructed indigenous protesters to “return to their reservations” in order to “avoid violent confrontations with citizens”.

The demonstrations, which began with a general strike on 28 April, quickly descended into violence after a heavy-handed response by riot squads from the militarized police force.

According to Temblores and Indepaz, two local watchdogs, 47 people have died during the unrest, with 35 deaths in Cali. But protesters in the city show no sign of backing down.

“We’ve been forgotten forever.” said Carmen Rosa Bejarano, 38, who has lived in Puerto Resistencia for her most of her life. “If they want us to back down, they’ll have to come here and ask – and if they come in shooting first, they won’t stand a chance.”

On Sunday night, tensions at the barricade were high. Lookouts a few blocks away reported that Esmad, Colombia’s feared riot police, were on the way.

“We are children of war,” said Carlos, another frontline protester, as he picked up a shield cut out of an oil drum. “We’re ready to fight.”

Elsewhere in the city, streets that would usually be bustling were empty; the dance halls of the world’s salsa capital were boarded up.

Among the few signs of life were the endless queues for fuel, which has been desperately scarce since the protests began.

Álvaro Pérez, who runs a small logistics business, had been waiting for six hours in a queue that snaked around the neighbourhood, and was losing patience.

“We need to go back to work, to be able to move around freely” he said. “I supported the protests at the beginning – most of us did – but this is never-ending now.”

Earlier on Sunday, a blockade set up by indigenous protesters outside the wealthy Ciudad Jardín neighbourhood was attacked by men in civilian clothes. Disturbing videos appear to show members of the police allowing the gunmen through. Other clips show vigilantes wielding handguns and assault rifles in broad daylight.

“It’s unacceptable that the authorities have not immediately heeded the urgent calls on them to prevent armed violence,” said Erika Guevara-Rosas, Americas director at Amnesty International.

The violence has been especially dispiriting for those who hoped for a peaceful future for Colombia when the country signed a historic deal with rebels of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Farc) in 2016.

That deal ended five decades of civil war and also raised hopes that new political spaces would finally open in a country where leftwing politicians and activists are routinely accused of collaborating with rebel groups.

Instead, the government has smeared protesters as “vandals” and “terrorists”, and the claims have been echoed by rightwing US politicians such as Marco Rubio.

Out on the streets, such rhetoric has only raised tensions. “The police or their hitmen will attack and we’ll push them back,” said Andrés, between updates on his walkie-talkie from the lookouts. “We’re ready.”",Cali is the cockpit of chaos as Colombia protests threaten to spiral out of control,1

One piece of footage, thought to have been captured in the city of Shanghai during clashes at the weekend, shows a man standing in the path of a police riot van before he is bundled to the floor and beaten by officers.

A second, thought to come from the city of Pingxiang also at the weekend, shows a female demonstrator calmly filming riot police before her phone is slapped out of her hand and hazmat-suited guards begin dragging her away.

As both videos spread online, Chinese social media users compared them to 'tank man' who blocked People's Liberation Army tanks as they left Tiananmen Square on June 5, 1989, the day after protesters demanding greater rights were massacred.

Both pieces of video drew comparisons with Tiananmen Square's famous 'tank man', a likeness that is sure to send shivers down spines in Beijing

What was the Tiananmen Square massacre? The Tiananmen Square massacre was the culmination of a series of protests in China in the spring of 1989. After decades of repression under the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) there was a growing desire for political and economic reform among university students and others. Following the death of Hu Yaobang, a former CCP general secretary who had advocated for democratic reforms before he was forced to resign, students rallied against the Government. On the day of his funeral on April 22, 1989, tens of thousands gathered in Tiananmen Square in Beijing, to demand economic, social and political liberalisation. This was followed by similar demonstrations in Shanghai, Nanjing, Xi'an and Chengdu. Hardliners in the CCP, driven by premier Li Peng and elder statesman Deng Xiaoping, called for a merciless crackdown on the protesters for fear of them spreading further. Martial law was declared in Beijing in May, but attempts by soldiers to try and reach the protesters in Tiananmen Square were foiled by locals who blocked the streets. Then in the early hours of June 4, tanks and heavily armed troops marched on the square, firing and crushing anyone who got in their way. Official Chinese sources put the death toll at 241, with 7,000 wounded, although international observers put the real figure much higher. Experts believe thousands died. The CCP has banned all official commemorations of the incident and has attempted to suppress references to it. Advertisement

The man has never been identified, but the image of him dressed in a salary-man's white short and trousers, clutching a briefcase and facing down four tanks alone has become a world-famous symbol of resistance in the face of insurmountable odds.

Protests against Xi Jinping's increasingly authoritarian rule of China - which were sparked over Covid lockdowns but have quickly spiraled to include calls for greater individual freedoms - have drawn comparisons with the doomed demonstrations 33 years ago.

Experts who spoke with MailOnline said the new protests are the first time they can recall a spontaneous, nationwide protest movement aimed at the central Chinese government since Tiananmen.

While the marches are not on the same scale and don't pose a direct threat to Xi or the Communist Party yet, the experts said they could easily spiral - especially when coupled with the economic difficulties facing the country.

Matthew Henderson, one of those who spoke out, said the protests mark the biggest threat to Xi's rule since he came to power a decade ago.

Separately, more footage revealed Chinese tanks rolling down the streets of Xuzhou - but it was unclear whether this was related to the protests or to recent military exercises.

Locals questioned whether the tanks were heading to Shanghai, but others said it was possible the tanks were merely returning from military manoeuvres.

Hundreds of protesters have taken to the streets since the weekend in protests fuelled by anger over the unrelenting lockdowns as well as deep-rooted frustrations over China's political direction.

They mark the largest anti-government demonstrations China has seen since the Tiananmen Square massacre in 1989.

Chinese officials have ramped up their crackdown against the protests in the wake of the western media's coverage of Xi's rule being criticised over his 'zero-Covid' policy, which has resulted in millions of people living under strict lockdown restrictions for months.

But despite the heavy police presence, some protesters defiantly continued in their historic demonstrations last night.

In Shanghai, around six police officers were seen surrounding one demonstrator, who is heard shouting for help. The protester is seen trying to stop the officers from arresting him, but to no avail as they dragged him away.

In the northeastern city of Jinan, a group of protesters clashed with Hazmat-officials. The demonstrators were seen picking up a road block and pushing it towards the officials last night.

Scores of police officers wearing hazmat suits were also seen in the southern city of Guangzhou last night, as officials tried to curb the angry protests.

A number of protesters have been detained by police - including BBC journalist Edward Lawrence - but it is difficult to know how many due to a crackdown on independent media outlets in China.

Mr Lawrence, a camera operator for the BBC's China Bureau who was covering the historic protests, was arrested and beaten by police officers. Chinese officials later made the bizarre claim that he was detained for his 'own good' in case he caught Covid from the crowd.

Shocking footage from the anti-government protests in Shanghai shows Edward Lawrence being dragged away by Xi's officers as he screams 'call the consulate now' to a friend.

Mr Lawrence was beaten and kicked by the police officers and held in custody for 'several hours' before being released.

His arrest has deepened long-running diplomatic tensions between Britain and China, with the UK today summoning Beijing's ambassador for a rebuke over the issue.

Speaking on his arrival at a NATO foreign ministers' meeting in Bucharest, Britain's foreign minister James Cleverly said he had instructed that the Chinese envoy be summoned over the incident.

'It is incredibly important that we protect media freedom. It is something very much at the heart of the UK's belief system, and it is incredibly important that journalists can go about their business unmolested and without fear of attack,' he said.

Meanwhile, China's police officers also used intimidation last night in an attempt to curb the anti-lockdown protests, with China's major cities of Beijing and Shanghai blanketed with security today in the wake of the nationwide rallies.

Police officers have begun calling protesters who attended the demonstrations in Beijing - and if they don't pick up, the officers go to their homes.

'We are all desperately deleting our chat history,' one Beijing protester who declined to be identified, said.

'There are just too many police. Police came to check the ID of one of my friends and then took her away. We don't know why. A few hours later they released her.'

Protests have erupted in at least seven cities over China's strict zero-Covid rules since the weekend.

The catalyst for the protests was an apartment fire last week in the western city of Urumqi in which ten people died. Many speculated that Covid curbs in the city, parts of which had been under lockdown for 100 days, had hindered rescue and escape, which city officials denied.

In Beijing and Shanghai, police were patrolling areas where some groups on the Telegram messaging service had suggested people gather again. The police presence on Monday evening and night ensured no gatherings took place there.

'The large number of police, it's really scary,' said Beijing resident Philip Qin, 22, who witnessed the protests on Sunday.

In Shanghai, near a site where weekend protests saw bold calls for the resignation of President Xi Jinping, bar staff told AFP they had been ordered to close at 10:00 pm for 'disease control'.

Police were checking making random checks on phones at the People's Square subway station in Shanghai Monday evening, an eyewitness said.

The person declined to give his name out of fear of retribution, as he was en route to a planned protest near the station, which he did not find.

Throughout the day police officers detained four people, later releasing one, with a reporter counting 12 police cars within 100 metres along Wulumuqi street in Shanghai.

'The atmosphere tonight is nervy. There are so many police around,' a man in his early 30s said on Monday night.

Residents said police have been asking people passing through those areas for their phones to check if they had virtual private networks (VPNs) and the Telegram app, which has been used by protesters, residents said.

VPNs are illegal for most people in China, while the Telegram app is blocked from China's internet.

Chinese officials have also started inquiries into some of the demonstrators who had gathered at the weekend protests across the country.

In one case, a caller identifying as a police officer in the Chinese capital asked the protester to show up at a police station on Tuesday to deliver a written record of their activities on Sunday night.

In another, a student was contacted by their college and asked if they had been in the area where events took place and to provide a written account.

Elsewhere, some rallies did go ahead. In semi-autonomous Hong Kong, where mass democracy protests erupted in 2019, dozens gathered at the Chinese University to mourn the victims of the Urumqi fire.

'Don't look away. Don't forget,' protesters shouted.

Although largely focused on Covid curbs, protesters have occasionally vented their frustration with the ruling Communist Party and Xi, who has concentrated power in his hands over the past decade and just recently secured another leadership term.

On Sunday, a large crowd gathered in the southwestern metropolis of Chengdu chanting: 'We don't want lifelong rulers. We don't want emperors.' Anti-Xi slogans were also briefly heard in Shanghai on Sunday.

Xi had taken personal responsibility for leading the 'war' against COVID. Officials say the zero-COVID policy has kept the death toll in the world's most populous country in the thousands, avoiding the millions of deaths elsewhere.

Many analysts say easing the policy could lead to widespread illness and deaths, overwhelming hospitals. A strong push on vaccinating the elderly is required before China could even contemplate re-opening, they say.

In a Tuesday editorial that did not mention the protests, the People's Daily, the Communist Party's official newspaper, urged citizens to 'unswervingly implement' zero-COVID policies, which put people's 'lives first,' saying victory would come through 'perseverance through thousands of hardships'.

'The harder it is, the more you have to grit your teeth,' it said.

China's strict control of information and continued travel curbs has made verifying the numbers of protesters across the vast country challenging.

But such widespread rallies are exceptionally rare, with authorities harshly clamping down on all opposition to the central government.

Without mentioning the protests, the criticism of Xi or the fire, some local authorities eased restrictions Monday.

The city government of Beijing announced it would no longer set up gates to block access to apartment compounds where infections are found.

'Passages must remain clear for medical transportation, emergency escapes and rescues,' said Wang Daguang, a city official in charge of epidemic control, according to the official China News Service.

Crikey also published the letters exchanged between its lawyers and those representing Rupert son's Lachlan, who is threatening to sue the website for defamation over an article Crikey published in 2021 by political commentator Bernard Keane.

The article and related social media posts were taken down at first as a 'goodwill' gesture by Crikey but both have since been republished as the publisher stands firm on not apologising.

Lachlan Murdoch, here seen with wife Sarah at 2019 Vanity Fair Oscar party, is threatening to sue Australian news site Crikey for an article about the Capitol Hill riots in 2021

Here's Crikey's open letter to Lachlan Murdoch in the @nytimes today.

In the open letter, which it ran as an ad in the New York Times and the Sydney Morning Herald, Crikey Managing Editor Peter Fray and the chairman of their publisher, Private Media, Eric Beecher say they were defending freedom of the press.

'We at Crikey strongly support freedom of opinion and public interest journalism,' they wrote.

'We are concerned that Australia’s defamation laws are too restrictive.'

The pair challenged Murdoch's Sydney-based lawyer John Churchill to follow through with his threat of legal action.

'We want to defend those allegations in court,' the pair wrote.

'You have made it clear in your lawyer’s letters you intend to take court action to resolve this alleged defamation.

'We await your writ so that we can test this important issue of freedom of public interest journalism in a courtroom.'

Crikey publisher Eric Beecher wrote an open letter daring the Murdochs to take legal action against his website

Justifying the decision to reprint all the correspondence between their lawyer at MinterEllison and Lachlan Murdoch's representative, Mr Fray claimed Crikey was performing a public service and taking up a cause the Murdochs had championed.

'Like the Murdochs, we believe in the public’s right to know,' Mr Fray wrote in an article on Crikey's website.

'Exposing this legal assault is the only way we believe we can shine light on the actions of a powerful media owner (and therefore a competitor of ours) to silence a small publisher by resorting to Australia’s defamation laws — laws that News Corp itself constantly argues should give the media more freedom to fulfil its mandated role.'

The alleged defamation was in an article written by Keane, called an 'analysis' piece by Crikey, about the Washington DC Capital Hill riot in January 2021, where he argued Fox News commentators played a major role in encouraging the Capitol Hill rioters in 2021.

Fox News is a American arm of the Murdoch family's News Corp media conglomerate.

The article mentions the Murdoch name twice, although it does not specify which family member it refers to, in the headline and in the final sentence.

Trump 'shaman' Jacob Chansley was part of the mob that invaded Congress in Washington to demand the US election result be overturned on January 6 last year

On June 30, Mr Churchill wrote to Crikey demanding that it immediately take down the article and accompanying social media post as it imputed 'defamatory' accusations about Lachlan 'conspiring' in the pro-Trump insurrection.

Mr Churchill called the article an 'unwarranted attack on my client, without any notice and in complete disregard of the facts'.

The letter also demanded Crikey publish an apology, which was provided by the lawyer, to potentially avoid legal action, but that option was not ruled out even if the steps were promptly taken.

In response, Crikey denied the article made defamatory imputations towards Lachlan Murdoch, arguing the Murdoch referred to was obviously family patriarch Rupert, but as a 'goodwill gesture' it took down the article and the social media posts.

Crikey also invited Lachlan to have an on-the-record interview with the site as a further 'goodwill gesture'.

Crikey later republished the article.

Lachlan Murdoch rejected the offer of an interview and his lawyer wrote back rejecting Crikey's claims the letter did not contain personal accusations and that other media had said similar things.

Some of the grievances Lachlan Murdoch's lawyer made against an article published by Crikey

'It is only in your clients’ publications that such scandalous allegations of criminal conduct and conspiracy have been alleged, directly imputing personal and deliberate participation in a plan to cause violence,' Mr Churchill wrote.

There have been further exchanges of letters with both sides sticking to their positions regarding an apology.

In the most recent letter sent to Crikey on August 9, Mr Churchill rejected Crikey's claims that what it published was 'responsible and reasonable public interest journalism'.

'Making allegations about my client in the article was a mistake that should be corrected, and any fair-minded publisher would have promptly offered a genuine apology,' he wrote.

'Your quotes and exaltations about curtailing freedom of speech do not apply — because, as occurs from time to time to most publishers, the journalism in this case is indefensible.'

Demands made by Lachlan Murdoch's lawyer of the independent news blog Crikey in relation to an article by Bernard Keane

In its August 9 reply, Crikey again rejected the demand for an apology.

'You are asking that our client apologise for the most extreme possible interpretation of our article, but not explain what that interpretation is,' MinterEllison partner Michael Bradley writes.

Shortly after 10pm, the Portland Police Bureau issued a warning to the demonstrators on Twitter which read: 'To those gathered at North Precinct: You are not to enter the property of North Precinct. Southeast Emerson Street is closed between NE MLK and NE 6th Ave.

'If you enter the property, you are trespassing and subject to arrest, citation, and/or the use of crowd control munitions.'

One video from the scene showed what appeared to be a mattress engulfed in flames as crowds chanted 'burn it down' in reference to the precinct.

It comes after 59 people, ranging in age from 15 to 50, were arrested on Saturday as hundreds more gathered for rallies and marches.

Molotov cocktails thrown in the street during a march sparked a large fire and prompted police to declare a riot.

Demonstrations in Portland started in late May after the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis.

Protestors have broken windows, set fires and pelted police with rocks during the clashes which continue to rumble on.

https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/apr/03/losing-your-home-is-a-massive-thing-how-the-climate-crisis-came-to-norfolk,1,"On a grey, bitterly cold March day, a large yellow digger is smashing its bucket into a small bungalow on the dunes. There is a wrenching tear. Within the time it takes to make a cup of tea, the house is flattened. An hour later, it’s gone, all traces loaded on to a truck, including the splintered wooden walls on which was written a goodbye message from the owners who spent their life savings on it.

The couple, who lived with their two terriers beside the sea in the Norfolk village of Hemsby, became Britain’s latest climate-crisis refugees early last month. North-easterly winds whipped up high spring tides that dispatched waves into the soft sand dunes of this holiday resort, whose population of 3,200 swells to 25,000 in high summer. Four metres of land vanished, leaving five homes teetering on the brink. Nine permanent residents were evacuated, their pretty 1930s seaside chalets deemed unsafe and demolished by the council before the next storm tipped them into the sea.

These newly homeless people are just the beginning. In Hemsby alone, there are scores of chalets on the fast-disappearing Marrams, as the sand dunes are known locally, and a further 92 homes on the road just behind. Elsewhere in Britain, it is not only coastal villages that face extinction this century: major towns and cities from Portsmouth to Hull face devastating flooding if seas rise by 1.5 metres. According to a recent study, 200,000 coastal properties in England are at risk of inundation within 30 years.

In theory, every coast is governed by a shoreline management plan. Most are to “hold the line” – defending against erosion. Hemsby’s is “managed realignment”, popularly known as managed retreat. Stepping back from indefensible coastlines in an era of rising seas sounds orderly and sensible. The reality, as the people of Hemsby reveal, is chaotic and reactive.

“Managed retreat is ‘managed let you die’. It’s managed ‘let you lose your home,’” says Malcolm Debbage. He and his partner, Frances Bolton, were one of 11 households in Hemsby to lose their homes during the “beast from the east” in 2018. “The people of Hemsby are unacknowledged victims of climate change, and it’s unacknowledged because of insurers who claim it’s a natural event like coastal erosion, and get out of paying,” he says.

Like many others living in Hemsby’s most vulnerable houses, Debbage and Bolton put their £80,000 life savings into a modest dream home by the sea in 2015 so they could go mortgage-free and scale back their secondhand book business. Their refurbished wooden chalet was one of hundreds built on vast dunes in the 1930s before planning regulations. There was no “buyer beware” and the couple obtained home insurance.

They were away visiting relatives when the most destructive of a trio of 2018 storms struck. Debbage was phoned by the Hemsby lifeboat crew, volunteers who spend winter helping residents at risk of erosion, and told his home was about to disappear. The crew roped themselves together and rescued a few of the couple’s most valuable books, including an early edition of Ulysses by James Joyce. Books, art, sofas, and all their photos from 13 trips to India were destroyed.

The couple were given emergency accommodation in a chalet in one of Hemsby’s capacious holiday parks. Later, Great Yarmouth borough council found them an unfurnished bungalow to rent in nearby Caister. But there was no mental health support and they couldn’t handle the pain of staying in the area. They moved to a housing association flat in London. “It’s a massive thing, losing your home,” says Debbage. “We’ve been left in the mire.” The couple are still pursuing legal claims against their insurance company and the council.

Five years on, Hemsby’s latest climate-crisis refugees are going through the same process, housed in the same bleak, out-of-season holiday park. But this time, there’s a palpable anger in the community, and a new determination to fight back.

A couple of Fridays ago, more than 250 local people crammed into the LA Lounge function room for an emergency meeting called by the lifeboat crew who outlined a new plan: fundraising to start legal action against the government, and a march on parliament. “We need to go to Westminster and cause a riot,” says one woman. “It’s time to stop talking and take some bloody action,” says another.

One of the newly homeless residents addressed the room. Their home was all they had, and they won’t own another one: their insurers won’t pay out, because the erosion is deemed an act of God. “It’s an act of the devil, not God,” she says.

Certainly, God has nothing to do with it. Hemsby’s misfortune is human-made. The climate crisis is bringing increased storminess and quickening coastal erosion but locals highlight other factors too: dredging sand from the seabed close to the coast, other sea defences disrupting the natural flow of sand along the coast to defenceless Hemsby, even the introduction of non-native species of marram grass, which bind the dunes less effectively than native marram. But most of all, every local blames the loss of homes on the authorities’ refusal to provide hard sea defences, which protect most of this vulnerable coastline but cruelly stop for 1.3km beside Hemsby.

Older residents describe scenes from the village’s 1950s heyday when a second world war pillbox stood beside three vast ridges of dunes. Today, one ridge of dunes remains and the pillbox is out at sea. “Great Yarmouth’s land was built out of cliffs washed into the sea from north Norfolk. As soon as that flow of sand stopped, the erosion started,” says local fisherman Paul Lines. The sand is pushed south by natural currents. After the catastrophic floods of 1953, new concrete sea defences north of Hemsby halted that flow. Its generous dunes started to shrink.

Local people are convinced that erosion is exacerbated by the dredging of sand relatively close to the coast, for which the crown estate – which owns most of the seabed around the UK – receives millions in licensing. “What happens when you dig a hole in wet sand?” asks Lorna Bevan, the co-owner of local pubs and shops and founder of the Save Hemsby’s Coastline charity. “It fills up again with sand. That sand has to come from somewhere.”

The crown estate says it takes its responsibility seriously and that licences can be withdrawn by the regulator, the Marine Management Organisation, if found to be having any unexpected impacts. “Any activity relating to the extraction of marine sand and gravel is carefully regulated, and any licences are subject to a comprehensive environmental impact assessment,” says a crown estate spokesperson.

Bevan created Save Hemsby’s Coastline after the storm surge of 2013, when the village lost 30 metres of land overnight and seven houses tipped into the sea. “That’s when something should’ve been done,” says Lorna’s brother, Lyndon Bevan. “The 2013 storm was ‘once-in-a-lifetime’. And then we had another. And then we had another.”

And nothing was done. Meanwhile, each year a fresh wave of incomers invest life savings in a dream home by the sea. One home on the most vulnerable Marrams is currently on the market for £200,000, with a small proviso to check coastal erosion. Houses appear to be a comfortable distance from the sea. Only long-term residents realise that the sea devours such distances in a decade or two. No regulations stop such sales. Most mortgage companies won’t lend but at least one resident with a house on the brink has a mortgage, and insurers still insure.

“When people come and look, estate agents put a spin on it and say: ‘You’re OK for 15 years,’” says Colin Martin, who has lived on the coast here for 70 years. “You can take the ‘1’ off that. A lot of people are sold the dream. You can sell anything when the sun is shining.”

“People think we’re all a bit dippy for living here,” says one woman who retired to the Marrams with her husband 22 years ago. “When we came we couldn’t see the sea from our house.” Now it’s nibbling the road at the bottom of their drive.

“We realised there was some erosion,” says Genny Measures, who moved with her husband, Simon, on to the Marrams two and a half years ago. “We’re not stupid. We were told that the sea defences were coming, and we’ve got plenty of land [between our house and the sea] and we’ll be OK for at least 20 years.”

“We thought you only live once, let’s try and live the dream,” says Simon. “But if the house goes, that’s our lives. The stress is not knowing what on earth is going on at any point.” Simon fears for the future of Hemsby. “What if the big holiday businesses pull out? People won’t book a seaside holiday with no seaside. It will become a ghost town.”

Hemsby residents have plenty of targets for their anger. Coastal protection is variously the responsibility of the Environment Agency (EA), Great Yarmouth borough council and the Marine Management Organisation. Big coastal defence decisions are made on EA cost-benefit calculations that Lorna Bevan argues are unfair, focusing on the modest “rateable value” of Hemsby’s homes rather than its tourist businesses, which generate £88m every year. Then there’s the local MP, Conservative Brandon Lewis. “Our MP has won the hide-and-seek championship for four years consecutively,” says Lines.

After the latest storms, Lewis called for a debate on coastal protection in the House of Commons. The government recently spent £40m on (mostly riverine) flood defences in his constituency, which protect 15,000 homes and numerous businesses in Great Yarmouth, explains Lewis. Meanwhile, Hemsby has belatedly been granted planning permission to place large granite rocks at the base of its dunes to buy sea-edge homes more time. But this will cost an estimated £20m and is unlikely to happen unless government funds miraculously appear. As an emergency response, the borough council has bought some rocks, which are being placed along just 40 metres of Hemsby’s 1,300-metre coast.

There’s nothing managed about “managed retreat” in Hemsby, is there? “That’s a fair point,” says Lewis. “The managed retreat seems to be: ‘When they go, they go.’ It is utterly tragic that people have lost their properties, but it is a very complex picture.” He says the local authority is responsible for drawing up the shoreline plan, but, unusually, a chunk of the beach and dunes is privately owned, by the Geoffrey Watling Charity, a trust based on the landholdings of a deceased local businessman. “To expect the taxpayer to pay for the protection of Watling land is challenging,” says Lewis.

What about more central government funds for coastal protection? “The Environment Agency is one of the largest quangos in Europe, so it’s pretty big and well-funded,” says Lewis. “To completely stop coastal erosion at Hemsby, the simple solution is a sea wall, but then you have no beach, which destroys the economy of Hemsby. There is clearly a wider issue on the east coast.”

Faced with various authorities failing to protect Hemsby, the village has tried to defend itself. To put anything on the beach requires planning permission. Local people were allowed to put 75 concrete blocks on the beach as a trial, but other attempts by individuals to erect DIY defences have been blocked. As the coastal crisis deepens, more direct action to defend homes seems likely. “We’ve decided it’s easier to ask for forgiveness than permission,” smiles lifeboat crew member Chris Batten.

One resident, Lance Martin, an indefatigable former soldier whose house is called Dune Fall, obtained permission to place rocks around the base of the dunes below his home. These saved his house during the latest storm – just. Left on the brink, he raced to enlist local digger drivers and neighbours to drag his wooden chalet inland before the council condemned it for demolition.

There was great spirit to this work. “It’s like a slightly crap Norfolk DIY SOS,” laughed one onlooker after the first attempt to drag the chalet away from the edge failed. But after a week of ingenious pulling and juggling with ropes, cables and telegraph poles, Martin’s home was shifted away from the edge. “My understanding is the Dutch government puts something like €1bn a year into their sea defences,” says Martin. “Why can’t we do that for the UK’s whole coast?”

In 2020, the UK government announced it would double its investment in flood and coastal erosion protection to £5.2bn over six years, but coastal campaigners point out that most of the money goes on riverine flood defence inland. The Dutch spent far more on sea defences and their coastline is a fraction of Britain’s – Essex alone has a longer coastline than the Netherlands.

Hemsby’s people cannot understand why they’re only getting 40 metres of rock defences. “I get frustrated as much as everyone else does. It’s exhausting, the bureaucracy,” says James Bensly, a borough and county councillor who also owns Hemsby’s beach cafe and several beach kiosks. “I work here, it’s my livelihood, but I can see what the local authorities are stuck with. They don’t have the power to address this. They have very little power, in all honesty. This is a global issue.

“We are the canary in the coalmine. What is happening here could happen to any major coastal community around the UK. We really need to get the enthusiasm down in London to make changes to the tools that are in place to help coastal communities.”

For now, all Hemsby possesses is the power of its small community. Amid tears and anger, their emergency meeting ends after thanks from one of its newly homeless residents. “We may have lost everything, but when we were removing our belongings with just a couple of hours’ notice, there were so many people who came and helped us,” she says, as villagers wipe tears from their eyes. “Stood here, I feel broke, but a millionaire.”",‘Losing your home is a massive thing’: how the climate crisis came to Norfolk,1

In Paris's working-class suburb of Clichy-sous-Bois, the number of people relying on food handouts is soaring as a strict coronavirus lockdown plunges France into its deepest recession since World War Two.

Many worked in the grey economy before the outbreak, and now receive little protection from France's generous welfare state.

Clichy-sous-Bois is part of the Paris banlieues, the low-income districts that encircle the city. Unemployment among its largely immigrant population was already well above the national average before the epidemic struck.

France on Thursday reported 516 new deaths from the coronavirus in the last 24 hours, bringing its overall toll to 21,856 fatalities.

But it said the number of patients in intensive care is continuing a two-week decline, falling by 165 over 24 hours to 5,053.

A majority of the deaths reported - 13,547 - were in hospital, and the rest in retirement homes and other facilities.

Although hospitals across France are still receiving a steady stream of new cases the overall number of those who remain hospitalised with the virus continues to drop, underscoring an eight-day trend.

'There were lots of women who worked looking after children... There was a whole economy based on getting by,' said Bachir Ghouinem, volunteering at the food bank in Clichy-sous-Bois, some 12 miles from the city centre, on Wednesday.

'So as everything stopped what did people find themselves with? Nothing.'

He and other volunteers would end up handing out sugar, pasta, cheese, milk and fresh fruit and vegetables - most donated by local stores rather than large retail chains - to around 1,600 families during the day, twice the number expected.

Queueing for food, Nathalie Barlagne, 46, said she had lost her job as a creche assistant before the crisis.

She had never before needed to rely on charity to support her family but could no longer afford her food bill after local markets closed. 'Now we have to shop in supermarkets and it's very expensive,' she said.

As the queue lengthened, Mohamed Mechmach, founder of local charity ACLEFEU, urged those in line to respect social distancing rules.

'Otherwise we won't be able to keep doing what we're doing,' he told the crowd. 'The prefect will just say ""Stop everything"". That would be a shame. We're all here for the same reason.'

A total of 29,219 virus cases are now being treated in hospital, down 522 on Wednesday.

In the banlieues, the strict curbs ordered by President Emmanuel Macron to try to contain the epidemic have exacerbated deep-seated social tensions

People queue for food. 'Since the coronavirus outbreak, there's a lot more poverty,' Sakho said

Since the start of the epidemic 42,088 people have left hospital, not taking into account the tens of thousands of people who healed without being interned, the health service said.

French authorities say the coming days are key if the country is to be able to meet a May 11 target to begin a gradual end to national lockdown measures imposed in mid-March.

Officials have warned that confinement must have proved to be a success before deconfinement can begin.

Due west of Clichy-sous-Bois in another suburb, Argenteuil, Kante Sakho's charity was delivering food parcels to households. He says he is shifting 600 a week, and is barely able to keep up with demand.

Some recipients were illiterate and unable to fill out the mandatory government forms justifying movement outside the home. Others were families struggling to feed their children three meals a day after schools shut down.

'Since the coronavirus outbreak, there's a lot more poverty,' Sakho said.

Cramped social housing, workers with frontline jobs and a restless younger generation have turned some into hotspots of infection and unrest

Violence hit several neighbourhood for five straight nights over the past week as the stringent lockdown ordered by the government continues to exacerbate deep-seated social tensions in the deprived, high-rise neighbourhoods that ring the capita

In the banlieues, the strict curbs ordered by President Emmanuel Macron to try to contain the epidemic have exacerbated deep-seated social tensions.

Cramped social housing, workers with frontline jobs and a restless younger generation have turned some into hotspots of infection and unrest.

Violence hit several neighbourhood for five straight nights over the past week as the stringent lockdown ordered by the government continues to exacerbate deep-seated social tensions in the deprived, high-rise neighbourhoods that ring the capital.

Fireworks were aimed at riot police and rubbish bins were set on fire during the unrest, which was sparked on Saturday night when a motorcyclist was injured in a collision with an unmarked police car during a check in Villeneuve-La-Garenne.

Police, who have launched an enquiry into the incident, said they had wanted to question the rider who had been seen speeding the wrong way down a street without a helmet.

France's 'banlieues' - high-rise housing estates on the outskirts of major cities - have long been flashpoints of anger over social and economic grievances. In 2005, unrest lasted three weeks after two youths died fleeing police in a northern Paris suburb.","On the margins of Paris, the food bank queues grow longer",1
https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/jan/10/illinois-republican-mary-miller-hitler-capitol-speech,1,"A newly elected Republican congresswoman has apologised for quoting Hitler in a speech in Washington.

In a statement, Mary Miller of Illinois said she “sincerely apologised for any offence” given when she told a crowd at the US Capitol: “Hitler was right on one thing. He said, ‘Whoever has the youth has the future.’ Our children are being propagandised.”

Miller paraphrased Hitler – who in 1935 told a rally: “He alone who owns the youth gains the future” – on Tuesday, in an address to a “Save the Republic” event hosted by Moms for America, a rightwing group which campaigns to “reclaim our culture for truth, family and freedom”.

Marjorie Taylor Greene, a new congresswoman from Georgia who has supported the QAnon conspiracy theory, and Mike Lindell, the owner of My Pillow who has become a prominent Trump backer, also spoke at the event, which was held in support of Donald Trump’s attempts to overturn his election defeat by Joe Biden.

A day later, after being told by Trump to “fight like hell”, supporters of the president stormed the Capitol in a violent putsch which left five people dead.

Miller, one of 147 Republicans who nonetheless went through with objections to electoral college results, was rebuked from all corners.

The United States Holocaust Museum, in Washington, said it “unequivocally condemns any leader trying to advance a position by claiming Adolf Hitler was ‘right’”.

Accompanying the museum statement, Irene Weiss, an Auschwitz survivor, “implore[d] our leaders and all Americans not to misuse history – my history.”

JB Pritzker, the Illinois governor, who is Jewish, called Miller’s remarks “reprehensible” and “disgusting”.

The Illinois senator Tammy Duckworth, like Pritzker a Democrat, called Miller’s remark “repugnant, obscene and unacceptable” and called for Miller, who was sworn in this month, to resign.

Illinois Democrats in the US House also called on Miller to quit. Adam Kinzinger, a Republican congressman from the state, said: “I outright condemn this garbage.”

In her apology, Miller said she was “passionately pro-Israel” and “a strong advocate and ally of the Jewish community”.

She also said her reference to “one of the most evil dictators in history” was meant to “illustrate the dangers that outside influences can have on our youth”.

Moms for America said Miller’s words were being “taken out of context and used as a weapon against her” and urged people to listen to her whole speech.

On Wednesday, a tweet from the congresswoman’s official account said she quoted Hitler as “a denunciation of evil dictators’ efforts to re-educate young people and similar efforts by leftwing radicals in our country today”.

The tweet was sent at 5.18pm ET, three hours after Trump supporters stormed the Capitol in an attempt to keep their leader in power. Some Republicans claimed the riot was caused by leftwing protesters. The FBI later said it was not.

On Friday, the same day she apologised for quoting Hitler, Miller condemned the riot. She also said she was “praying for the family, friends and colleagues of Capitol police officer Brian Sicknick, who tragically passed away last night”.

Sicknick confronted the rioters. Reportedly struck with a fire extinguisher, he later collapsed and died. He was 42.",Illinois Republican Mary Miller sorry for quoting Hitler in Capitol speech,1
https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-12765607/New-Capitol-riot-footage-Matt-Gaetz.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490,1,"Republicans are expressing their delight after House Speaker Mike Johnson began releasing thousands of hours of surveillance footage from the US Capitol riot on January 6, 2021.

The first tranche of around 90 hours of footage was released on a public committee website Friday, with the rest of the 44,000 hours expected to be posted over the next several months.

Rep. Matt Gaetz, who led the ouster of Johnson's predecessor Kevin McCarthy, praised the new speaker for keeping his promise to the caucus to release the footage.

'HE WON'T LIE,' Gaetz wrote in a post on X. 'If he says he is going to do something, he is going to do it.'

Other congressional Republicans, including Rep. Troy Nehls and Senator Mike Lee, called for fresh investigations, and accused the former Democrat-led House January 6 Committee of hiding some of the footage.

Republicans are expressing their delight after House Speaker Mike Johnson began releasing thousands of hours of surveillance footage from the US Capitol riot

The video gives a bird's eye view of the Capitol complex as hundreds of then-President Donald Trump's supporters stormed the building in a bid to prevent the certification of Joe Biden's election..

Conservative activist Charlie Kirk posted one of the new clips, claiming it shows that Capitol police 'facilitated the protesters passage' through the building.

In reality, that footage appears to show cops blocking a hallway and funneling the rioters toward an exit, and follows other clips from the same camera in which some protesters were seen being detained in flexi-cuffs.

Citing the clip, Lee posted on X: 'Why didn't Liz Cheney and Adam Kizinger ever refer to any of these tapes?'

'Maybe they never looked for them. Maybe they never even questioned their own narrative,' he said, referring to the two Republican members of the House January 6 Committee, who are both no longer in congress.

Cheney responded in her own X post showing a montage of violent confrontations between the demonstrators and cops, writing 'Here's some January 6th video for you.'

Lee replied: 'Liz, we've seen footage like that a million times. You made sure we saw that—and nothing else. It's the other stuff—what you deliberately hid from us—that we find so upsetting.'

Rep. Matt Gaetz, who led the ouster of Johnson's predecessor Kevin McCarthy, praised the new speaker for keeping his promise to release the footage

'We need to investigate the J6 committee,' Lee in another post. 'Given the evidence they apparently suppressed, how much footage (and how many other records) do you think Nancy Pelosi and the J6 committee deliberately lost or destroyed?'

Nehls, a member of the right-wing House Freedom Caucus, wrote in his own post: 'The J6 committee was a sham. I knew it then. Everyone knows it now. Let's investigate the investigators.'

The newly released footage is a grab-bag of clips, some as short as two seconds long, showing a mix of empty hallways, crowds breaking through windows, handfuls of demonstrators wandering through the Capitol, police milling around.

The new release does not include some of the most dramatic and violent videos from the day, which have previously come out in the January 6 committee hearings, and criminal proceedings against the rioters.

More than 1,202 defendants have been charged in connection with the breach, including suspects from nearly all 50 states and the District of Columbia.

The DOJ said earlier this month that some 418 defendants have been charged with assaulting, resisting, or impeding cops or Capitol employees during the riot.

For the last several months, the GOP-led House Administration Committee has made the video available by appointment only to members of the media, criminal defendants and a limited number of other people.

By expanding this access to the general public, Johnson is fulfilling one of the pledges he made last month to the most conservative members of his party.

The footage shows Congressional members and staffers moving to safety following the breach

Some rioters are seen detained in flexi-cuffs in part of the newly released footage

The grab-bag of footage also reveals some of the more mundane moments of January 6

'This decision will provide millions of Americans, criminal defendants, public interest organizations, and the media an ability to see for themselves what happened that day, rather than having to rely upon the interpretation of a small group of government officials,' Johnson said in a statement.

In a post on his Truth Social platform, Trump congratulated the speaker 'for having the courage and fortitude' to release the footage.

The move by Johnson will grant the general public a stunning level of access to sensitive and explicit January 6 security footage.

Critics have warned the video could endanger the safety of staff and members in the Capitol complex if it gets into the wrong hands.

The hours of footage detail not only the shocking assault rioters made on US Capitol Police as they breached the building, but also how the rioters accessed the building and the routes lawmakers used to flee to safety.

DailyMail.com has reached out to the Capitol Police for comment.

Johnson that the committee is processing the footage to blur the faces of individuals 'to avoid any persons from being targeted for retaliation of any kind,' however the clips released on Friday did not appear redacted.

He added that an estimated 5 percent of the footage will not be publicly released as it 'may involve sensitive security information related to the building architecture.'","Matt Gaetz praises Speaker Mike Johnson for releasing 44,000 hours of Capitol riot footage - as Mike Lee demands probe of Dem-led Jan. 6 committee for 'hiding' the video",1

Wayne Gatt implied protesters seen being roughly tackled, bashed with batons, and pepper sprayed while on the ground deserved it just for showing up.

He lashed out that those who wanted to have 'needless debates' about whether police actions in those cases were 'proportionate'.

Mr Gatt even pushed to shut down discussion of 'issues of what's right and what's wrong' arising from the protests.

Instead, he insisted brutal tactics were justified because police and the government had to 'stop nancy-pansying around' anti-lockdown demonstrators.

Tensions boiled over after a tense standoff between anti-lockdown protesters and police in Melbourne on Saturday

A woman, reported to be in her 70s, was knocked to the ground during the violent clashes between protesters and police in Melbourne

More than 1,000 demonstrators swarmed Melbourne's CBD on Saturday in defiance of the city's stay-at-home orders.

Ten officers were injured while dealing with the protests, including a broken elbow and broken nose, a broken finger and torn muscles. Six officers were taken to hospital.

An elderly woman was shoved to the ground and doused with pepper spray by two policemen during the riot.

The woman was bowled over by the two cops before they fired the spray directly on her face as she lay defenceless on the road trying to shield her eyes.

Disturbing photos and video of the scene divided the public who were outraged at heavy-handed police tactics, while others felt she deserved it for breaking public health orders.

More footage has since surfaced of a man being tackled to the ground following a wild police chase on foot during the protests in inner-city Richmond.

The 30 second clip begins with the man running away from dozens of police officers in hot pursuit as several shocked passers-by watch on.

He eventually surrenders by putting his hands in the air as two officers catch up to him in a laneway.

He's quickly surrounded by officers who tackle him to the ground and detain him.

Voice For Victoria slammed the forceful arrest when it shared the extraordinary footage late Saturday night.

The union boss said his officers showed as 'much restraint as they could' in the face of violent hooligans who broke through their lines.

'We need to stop nancy-pansying around these people, and we need to stop this needless debate about the proportionality, issues of what's right and what's wrong,' Mr Gatt told reporters on Sunday.

He said his colleagues expressed concern over the increasingly violent tactics deployed by protestors.

'They came into that demonstration with the intent to hurt our members, and they succeeded against 10 of them,' he said.

'I'm not coping looking at the 0.01 per cent of actions and looking at our members who were confronted with such overwhelming violence.'

Mr Gatt implied non-violent protesters caught in the crossfire between the angry mob and police deserved to be injured because they broke lockdown to participate.

'Those actions wouldn't have occurred if those people didn't attend an unlawful protest, no one had to be there,' he said.

It might sound dramatic but, as Boris Johnson announced all Covid laws are finally being axed and we will be able to make sensible decisions for ourselves again, I let out a visceral sigh of relief and my shoulders all of a sudden felt lighter.

After 23 months of soul destroying and, frankly, deadly restrictions, I rejoice that one of the most shameful eras in our recent history, where our civil liberties and freedoms were stripped away en masse with virtually no debate or opposition, is at an end.

The scientific establishment, the media hysterics and the scare mongering Labour opposition have lost their battle to trap us into a liberty destroying Covid blackhole for years to come – and by God they tried.

As the Leader of No Opposition Keir Starmer made clear in Parliament today, if he had his way the UK would be following his pals Justin Trudeau in Canada and Jacinda Ardern in New Zealand into divisive, unnecessary and never-ending regulations like vaccine and mask mandates that are currently tearing those two Commonwealth countries apart.

Of course, there is much to criticise: Boris plunged the country into draconian lockdowns three times with no evidence they actually worked; increasingly, it looks like they killed far more folk than they saved.

Pictured: Labour Party leader Keir Starmer speaks following a statement from Prime Minister Boris Johnson on coronavirus disease (COVID-19) restrictions at the House of Commons

Chief Medical Officer, Sir Chris Whitty, Boris Johnson and Chief Scientific Adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance address the nation during a press conference on plan for Living With Covid yesterday

But I do feel proud to be British today; proud that we have a Prime Minister prepared to stand up to the terrifying new international health establishment and allow his citizens to move on from a virus that is now no more deadly than a run of the mill flu.

I'm proud too that we have a 95-year-old monarch who has continued to work during her brush with the variant Omicron, sending a clear message to her people that the days of Covid hysteria are at an end.

The focus now must be on ensuring we never react in the same way again.

That's going to be hard, especially given so many of those with influence are addicted to the damaging lockdown policies they have followed since March 2020 and are unable to have the good grace to admit they called it wrong.

And because we have a media elite obsessed with encouraging the government to deprive us of freedom wherever possible who always manage to ask the wrong questions.

Like Sky News' lockdown-breaking star presenter Kay Burley who, upon hearing the news of the Queen's cold-like symptoms, tweeted: 'Might this impact on any decision by the Government to further lift #COVID19 restrictions?'

Prime Minister Boris Johnson (pictured) laid out 'Living With Covid' strategy to MPs yesterday

Er, no, of course not, Kay!

The fact the Queen is likely to breeze through her brush with Covid, thanks to the milder nature of the variant, her triple vaccinated status and (probably) the use of antiviral drugs, means ordinary life beckons.

We have beaten the virus, but what we now need to battle is the establishment blob which wants to continue to inflict control.

SNP's village idiot at Westminster Ian Blackford described Boris's plan today as 'reckless' because it 'flies in the face of advice of scientists at the World Health Organisation'.

What, you mean the organisation that effectively colluded with the communist Chinese regime to cover up the outbreak in the first place and have continually refused to hold China to account?

And it might not be popular in polite society circles to question our own scientific and medical masterminds, but Saint Christopher Whitty and Lord Patrick Vallance have proved total flops when it comes to their pandemic advice.

Boris Johnson (C), Britain's Chief Medical Officer Chris Whitty (L), and Chief Scientific Adviser Patrick Vallance attend a press conference to outline the new long-term Covid-19 plan

Remember, Whitty wanted to destroy all of our Christmases and damage countless businesses by locking us all down again in December for Omicron, despite South African medics insisting the variant was a pussycat.

We were told we could have as many as 6,000 deaths and a million infections a day.

But, sparked by the rebellion from brave Tory backbenchers and an even braver Cabinet resignation from Lord Frost, Boris didn't lock down and the worst case scenario never eventuated. Not even close. And that's despite Omicron being far more transmissible.

Even Bill Gates reluctantly admitted over the weekend Omicron is working as a natural vaccine.

He said: 'Sadly, the virus itself, particularly, the variant called omicron, is a type of vaccine, that is, it creates both B-cell and T-cell immunity, and it's done a better job getting out to the world population than we have with vaccines.'

I have no idea what he's sad about – Omicron should be celebrated as a natural vaccine that is providing a path out of this two-year hellscape.

And we know now that natural immunity provides stronger protection from Covid than vaccines, anyway.

But these should be yesterday's arguments and it's tragic and pathetic to see so many vested parties seemingly wanting the Covid and lockdown chaos and carnage to continue for another moment longer than necessary.

Labour's Starmer and his mini me Wes Streeting have been out the past 24 hours trying to convince us that Boris handing back our God given freedoms that were only ever meant to be compromised while the NHS was under imminent threat of being overwhelmed is somehow irresponsible.

But remember they also said Freedom Day last July shouldn't go ahead and pushed for a path to lockdown before Christmas.

The Be Kind left around the world has collapsed morally internationally thanks to the totalitarian path of segregating society between the vaccinated and unvaccinated.

For months, I've heard people wish Ardern or Trudeau were in charge in the UK. Things would be so much better, they insist.

Well, I beg to differ as riot police currently clash with non-violent protestors in Canada's capital of Ottawa and New Zealand's capital of Wellington to try and deal with the unjabbed truckers, paramedics, doctors and teachers who have lost their jobs thanks to the cruel and counterproductive vaccine mandates.

Boris implored us today to get back to the days where personal responsibility was king

'It is time that we got our confidence back,' he said, in a storming speech to parliament.

'We don't need laws to compel people to be considerate to others. We can rely on that sense of responsibility towards one another – providing practical advice in the knowledge that people will follow it to avoid infecting loved ones and others.

'So let us learn to live with this virus and continue protecting ourselves and others without restricting our freedoms.'

That's all I've ever asked for.

It was always a pipe dream to think we could shut down a respiratory virus. Food must still get to your door, delivery drivers still need to enter the country, essential workers still need to get to work, we still need to socialise with other human beings.

I believe that, in time, when all the costs have been properly analysed, lockdown will prove to be one of the most disastrous policy approaches, both in terms of public health and the economy, in history.

There is certainly no longer any justification for legal requirements to self-isolate, the £15.7 billion test and trace white elephant, perpetual boosters for the healthy or the terrifying provisions of the Coronavirus Act. I celebrate that they're all going.

The biggest danger now to society is those folk in the media and politics who should know better continuing to propagate the myth that we remain in the midst of a dangerous pandemic when Omicron has rendered Covid defeated.",DAN WOOTTON: Boris has given us back our freedom but the Covid control-freaks haven't gone away,1

The event run by far-Right group Patriotic Alternative was attended by about 150 people dressed in smart clothes, and locals assumed it was a wedding party.

The white supremacist group used the charity-run village hall in Waltham on the Wolds, Leicestershire to host their reportedly well-catered annual general meeting.

The neo-Nazi rally was attended by guest speakers including PA leader and ex-Young BNP chairman Mark Collett and Sam Melia, who is due to face a trial next year after being charged with stirring up racial hatred.

Others in attendance reportedly also include American neo-Nazis Warren Balogh and Tony Hovater, both senior members of the white supremacist National Justice Party.

Locals were left stunned after they learned that an event thought to be a 'wedding reception' at a village hall was actually the annual rally for British neo-Nazi group Patriotic Action

The neo-Nazi rally was attended by guest speakers including PA leader and ex-Young BNP chairman Mark Collett (pictured in February speaking to anti-asylum protesters in Skegness)

The white supremacist group used the charity-run village hall (pictured) in hall in Waltham on the Wolds, Leicestershire to host their reportedly well-catered annual general meeting

Patriotic Alternative was founded in 2019 by Collett, a Neo-Nazi who calls for a 'racially pure white society' and led the BNP's youth wing before the party expelled him. It now claims to have more than 15,000 members.

Patriotic Alternative was accused of lying to the charity who run the village hall about who would actually be using it - and Collett was being congratulated on the group's Telegram channel for organising the event, Searchlight reports.

The village hall committee said the event had been booked using an 'alias' and they were unaware of its true nature.

Local Michael Walker, 60, said that the attendees were 'dressed very smartly' when they were at the hall which often holds Cubs and Scouts meetings, parent and baby sessions and wedding receptions.

'We just assumed that was what it was,' he told the Sun, adding that he was left 'speechless' when he found out the meeting's true nature.

He said that he would be 'surprised' if the venue knew the event's true nature as it is unlikely they would have allowed the booking. Another local also told the paper that the event appeared to be a wedding.

The Hall Committee issued a statement that said: 'This booking was made under an alias that did not alert us to the nature or content of the event.

'We do not support or affiliate with Patriotic Alternative or any other political group. Waltham on the Wolds Village Hall is a volunteer run charity, and we welcome people from all communities and promote diversity and inclusivity'.

MPs have previously called for Patriotic Alternative to be banned. The group has often protested against asylum seekers and is linked to banned group National Action.

Police were called in when hundreds of Patriotic Alternative protesters clashed outside a library over a story time event hosted by a drag queen in Norwich in February

Patriotic Alternative was founded in 2019 by Neo-Nazi Mark Collett, who led the BNP's youth wing before the party expelled him

A series of violent disturbances earlier this year threw a spotlight on Britain's largest far-Right group, which is led by a Neo-Nazi Holocaust denier.

Patriotic Alternative is understood to have led a group of activists who picketed a 'drag story hour' by children's author Aida H Dee reading at the Tate Britain in London on Saturday.

The group has also been accused of fuelling Friday's anti-refugee riot outside a hotel housing asylum seekers in Knowsley, Liverpool. It denied reports it organised the event but had been leafleting locally in recent weeks.

Last year, supporters of the group were filmed by Channel 4's Dispatches describing England and Chelsea striker Raheem Sterling as a 'chimp' and a 'n*****'.",Locals are stunned to learn village hall 'wedding reception' is actually British neo-Nazis' annual rally,1

Panicked pro-Palestine demonstrators tumbled down stairs as they tried to flee when cops flooded the Ivy League campus on Tuesday night.

Almost 100 people were arrested at the New York City university, according to NBC. Police stated there were no injuries or people resisting arrest.

Around 40 of those detained were picked up in on the first floor of Hamilton Hall, which students violently took over early Tuesday. Cops swooped in on the building through a window after using flash bangs to clear the way.

President Minouche Shafik called in the police 'to restore order and safety' to the campus amid the escalating protests and fears the demonstrations had been co-opted by external agitators.

University administrators have asked the NYPD to maintain a presence on campus until at least May 17, two days after graduation.

Dozens of cops poured into Hamilton Hall via a window using a ramp attached to a huge armored truck. Video showed the police hammering at locked doors before sweeping in with riot shields.

Footage showed protesters being dragged out of the campus, some carried by several officers if they refused to walk, and loaded on to buses.

Just after 10pm, the campus was cleared out and locked down by police with many protesters heading north to City College of New York, where police were also raiding a similar encampment.

An encampment first sprung up at Columbia on April 17 after Shafik was hauled before Congress to address anti-Semitism on campus.

Around 9pm on Tuesday, officers stormed the university as the crowd chanted and yelled at them, some confronted the officers and pushed barricades to try and block their path.

A shelter in place warning was issued to students on Morningside campus in the moments before officers descended.

In a statement, the university said the decision to call in police was, 'made to restore safety and order to our community'.

'We regret that protesters have chosen to escalate the situation through their actions,' the statement read.

Playtime is over.

'After the University learned overnight that Hamilton Hall had been occupied, vandalized, and blockaded, we were left with no choice.

'Columbia public safety personnel were forced out of the building, and a member of our facilities team was threatened. We will not risk the safety of our community or the potential for further escalation.'

Former president Donald Trump praised officer's response to the situation, but said it should have come 'a lot sooner.'

'There's tremendous damage that's been done to that building, when you look at it it's a landmark and it's really been damaged by these people,' he told Fox News. 'People have to respect the law and order of this country.'

He also hit out at president Joe Biden and called for him to speak up more strongly against anti-Semitism.

The occupation of Hamilton Hall was the latest escalation in the unrest which has rocked the school in recent weeks. Protesters have been demanding the college divest from companies with links to Israel or firms profiting from its war on Hamas.

College officials have been battling to shut down the encampment, stating it violates university polices. Following the occupation of Hamilton Hall, Shafik warned that those involved would face expulsion.

More than 100 activists had already been arrested at the school prior to Tuesday's operation.

A first encampment was broken up by NYPD officials. But university officials had vowed not to take similar steps for the current protest.

They gave students an ultimatum to leave, but few followed the instructions.

'We will not leave until Columbia meets every one of our demands,' one activist screamed from a balcony in the building after the takeover.

Officials then started to suspend students before a group raided Hamilton Hall.

'We believe that the group that broke into and occupied the building is led by individuals who are not affiliated with the University,' officials continued.

'Sadly, this dangerous decision followed more than a week of what had been productive discussions with representatives of the West Lawn encampment.

Police shut down a previous encampment at Columbia and the university had vowed not to take similar measures going forward. However, an escalation in protest tactics appears to have reversed this decision

'The decision to reach out to the NYPD was in response to the actions of the protesters, not the cause they are championing. We have made it clear that the life of campus cannot be endlessly interrupted by protesters who violate the rules and the law.'

But the move was condemned by the Columbia University Chapter of the American Association of University Professors, which said its members had been locked out of campus.

'NYPD presence in our neighborhood endangers our entire community. Armed police entering our campus places students and everyone else on campus at risk,' a statement read.

'We hold university leadership responsible for the disastrous lapses of judgement that have gotten us to this point.'

The statement added faculty had spent the trying to defuse the situation, but were 'rebuffed or ignored.'

At a press conference prior to the raid, NYPD Assistant Commissioner Rebecca Weiner warned the protest had been co-opted by external agitators who were not affiliated with the university.

She stressed the occupation had the potential to spill into other campus buildings, as well as other universities across the country.

'This is not about what's happening overseas, it's not about the last seven months, it's about a very different commitment to at times violent protest activity as an occupation,' she said.

The festival had to be cancelled as attendees were evacuated to safety, but there were no reports of injuries.

Animosity toward sexual minorities is prevalent in the predominantly Orthodox Christian Georgia - and several previous LGBT events have previously been met with violent disruptions.

Organisers accused the authorities of actively colluding with the demonstrators to disrupt the festival, but a government minister said it was a difficult event to police as it was held in an open area, near a lake.

Deputy Interior Minister Alexander Darakhvelidze said: 'The protesters managed to find... ways to enter the area of the event, but we were able to evacuate the Pride participants and organisers.

'Nobody was harmed during the incident and police are now taking measures to stabilise the situation.'

Festival organizers called on people not to come to the lakeside park where the event was to be held.

Georgian news outlets estimated about 5,000 people marched toward the site. Many of them waved Georgian flags and carried religious icons.

The director of Tbilisi Pride confirmed to Reuters that all the event's participants had been bussed to safety but criticised the policing at the Pride, which she said had been held in private for a second year running to reduce the risk of violent protests.

Mariam Kvaratskhelia said far-right groups had publicly incited violence against LGBT activists in the days leading up to the Pride events and that the police and interior ministry had declined to investigate.

She said: 'I definitely think this [disruption] was a preplanned, coordinated action between the government and the radical groups... We think this operation was planned in order to sabotage the EU candidacy of Georgia.'

The police and government could not immediately be reached to comment on her accusations.

However, Georgia's President Salome Zourabichvili, a frequent critic of the government, echoed the criticism of the police, saying they had failed in their duty to uphold people's right to assemble safely.

She said the government 'must ensure that the Pride festival is held in safety'.

President Zourabichvili added: 'Freedom of speech and of assembly are fundamental rights and their violation is unacceptable.'

Critics have long accused the government of tacitly supporting homophobic and nationalist groups that traditionally support the ruling Georgian Dream party and have staged protests against pro-Western opposition parties.

In 2019, hundreds of far-right activists burned rainbow flags in Tbilisi to protest the screening of an Oscar-nominated gay-themed film.

In 2013, thousands of ultra-conservative supporters of the Orthodox church disrupted a Tbilisi rally to mark International Day Against Homophobia.

Activists had to board buses provided by police to escape the mob, which pursued them across the capital's main square, while hurling stones, breaking windows and threatening to kill the people hoping to celebrate Pride.

Georgia decriminalised homosexuality in 2000, with anti-discrimination laws adopted in 2006 and 2014.

Georgia aspires to join the European Union but its ruling Georgian Dream Party has faced increased criticism from rights groups and the EU over its perceived drift towards authoritarianism.

After violent street protests in March, it withdrew a Russian-style bill that would have required non-government organisations receiving more than 20% of their funding from abroad to register as 'agents of foreign influence'.

Georgia has passed laws against discrimination and hate crimes, but LGBT rights groups say there is a lack of adequate protection by law enforcement officials and homophobia remains widespread in the socially conservative South Caucasus nation.

Trump made the comment as Joe Biden prepares to trumpet new funding for distribution and a faster clip of vaccinations – even as the 45h president did not appear in a public service announcement with three of his predecessors urging Americans to get their shot.

'I hope everyone remembers when they're getting the COVID-19 (often referred to as the China Virus) vaccine, that if I wasn't president, you wouldn't be getting that beautiful 'shot' for five years, at best, and probably wouldn't be getting it at all.' he wrote.

Donald Trump, pictured, sought to take credit for America's vaccine success after some of the available jabs were developed under his presidency

The statement was carried on his official 45th President letterhead – though it took on the tone of one of his famous tweets before getting banned from Twitter after the Jan. 6th MAGA riot.

It was not immediately clear why Trump put the word 'shot' in quotation marks – although it could refer to the slogan of the new PSA.

'This is our shot,' says former President Bill Clinton in the ad. 'Now, it's up to you,' adds former President Jimmy Carter.

Trump's plea comes as credit for the vaccine that could soon transform the daily lives of millions of Americans was already taking shape.

The Pfizer vaccine, which was first out of the gate, was developed privately. But the Moderna vaccine, which like Pfizer is extremely effective, got assistance from Trump's 'Operation Warp Speed.'

Trump issued the statement under the letterhead of The Office of Donald J. Trump but it read like one of the tweets he has been unable to send since his social media ban

The administration claimed based off 'reported administered' data that there was a new record for vaccine shots Saturday. The number later proved to be not accurate

Biden on Thursday announced plans to purchase an additional 100 million Johnson & Johnson vaccine doses.

The former president's use of the phrase 'China virus' was another attempt to needle his successor. He regularly casts Biden as beholden to the rival, and used the term during his tenure even after critics called it racist.

Since taking office, the Biden team has taken to blasting the state of the vaccine program they inherited, particularly on the distribution side – despite its vaccine development efforts getting credit during the transition.

Biden plans to address the nation tonight in a prime time address from the White House. The White House announced Thursday Biden was moving up the bill signing by a day for his $1.9 trillion relief package, amid Republican complaints he was stringing it out for show.

Biden and his coronavirus advisor Andy Slavitt were put on the defensive when the AP reported in a fact check that both had overstated the 'record' 2.9 million doses given Saturday. The real number was 1.6 million. The earlier CDC figure had included doses from other days.

Trump's statement comes amid a rush to distribute vaccine - and a battle over who deserves credit

Trump found himself being praised for his part in the roll-out of the coronavirus vaccine from an unexpected quarter - before then characteristically doubling down and hailing his own contribution.

As Joe Biden revels in the rapid pace of the roll-out that is set to deliver its 100millionth dose in the coming days, even the New York Times said the former president's administration needs to take some of the credit.

Trump, though, not to be outdone released a statement in which he claimed that without him, people may not be getting protection from the virus 'at all'.

Issuing the statement under the letterhead of The Office of Donald J. Trump, he said: 'I hope everyone remembers when they're getting the Covid-19 (often referred to as the China Virus) vaccine, that if I wasn't president, you wouldn't be getting that beautiful shot for five years, at best, and probably wouldn't be getting it at all.'

Writing in the New York Times, Sharon LaFraniere said the current success of the roll-out of the vaccine in the U.S. needed examining.

She wrote: 'A closer look at the ramp-up offers a more mixed picture, one in which the new administration expanded and bulked up a vaccine production effort whose key elements were in place when Mr Biden took over for President Donald J Trump.

'Both administrations deserve credit, although neither wants to grant much to the other.'

She also said that Mr Biden had 'benefited hugely from the waves of vaccine production that the Trump administration had set in motion'.

Trump's boast was backed up by his former press secretary Kayleigh McEnany, who accused Biden of 'denying the successful operation Trump left him'.

'President Trump put in place an unprecedented vaccine operation that paved the way for President Biden,' she said.

The Pfizer and Moderna vaccines passed clinical trials and were approved while Trump was president, giving the US a head start on many other nations.

But Pfizer developed its vaccine without any research funding from Operation Warp Speed, the federal jab program touted by the Trump administration.

Other vaccines such as the Oxford/AstraZeneca jab were developed at similarly impressive speed without any help from Trump or the US government.

Nonetheless, while in office, Trump asked future historians to 'remember that these great discoveries which will end the China Plague all took place on my watch'.

Trump last month told his supporters at CPAC to 'get your shot', but is absent from two new public announcements featuring every other living former president.

Jimmy Carter, Bill Clinton, George W. Bush and Barack Obama will appear in the public service announcements with their respective first ladies, the Ad Council says.

Joe Biden, pictured, is on track to reach his goal of vaccinating 100million people in his first 100 days in office - but Trump wants people to give him credit

'The science is clear. These vaccines will protect you and those you love from this dangerous and deadly disease,' said President Bush in one of the adverts.

'That's the first step to ending the pandemic and moving our country forward,' Obama says.

When asked about Trump's absence, a spokesman for the Ad Council said one of the PSAs was filmed at Biden's inauguration in January which Trump did not attend.

While Trump and his allies claim credit for the rapid roll-out, the Biden White House says it has nearly doubled the number of jabs being delivered per week.

Press secretary Jen Psaki said earlier this month that the number of doses available per week had risen from 8.6million to 15.2million since Biden took office.

Biden promised 100million doses in his first 100 days in office, a mission which is comfortably on target with nearly 96million jabs handed out so far.

The daily rate of vaccinations now averages more than two million shots, and more than 75million doses have been administered since Biden was sworn in.

Former presidents Barack Obama, George W. Bush and Bill Clinton will appear in public service announcements about the Covid-19 vaccines, but Trump will not

Under pressure to set a more ambitious target, Biden indicated after taking office that he might raise the goal to 150million.

The rapid progress has put America near the top of the world rankings, with a rate of 28 doses administered per 100 people comparing favorably to other rich nations.

Around 18 per cent of the population has received at least one dose, behind Britain's 33 per cent but well ahead of the European Union figure of seven per cent.

Nearly 10 per cent of Americans have had two doses, a figure bettered only by Israel and the United Arab Emirates, according to research by Our World In Data.

On Wednesday, Biden said the US would start exporting surplus jabs once 'Americans are taken care of' as he unveiled plans to buy another 100million doses.

We're going to start off and ensure Americans are taken care of first, but we're then going to try to help the rest of the world,' Biden told reporters.

'If we have a surplus, we're going to share it with the rest of the world,' Biden said, adding that 'we're not going to be ultimately safe, until the world is safe.",Donald Trump says from Mar-a-Lago that HE deserves credit for vaccine shots,1

This is the first abortion case to be decided with anti-abortion Trump-appointee Amy Coney Barrett on the court. The decision reinstates an FDA rule that Mifeprex, a drug used for abortion early in pregnancy, must be administered by medical professionals at clinics or hospitals.

https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8385995/Prosecutors-3-arrested-terrorism-charges-Las-Vegas.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490,1,"Three Nevada men with ties to a loose movement of right-wing extremists advocating the overthrow of the US government are facing terrorism-related charges in what authorities say was a conspiracy to spark violence during recent protests in Las Vegas.

Stephen T Parshall, 35, Andrew Lynam, 23, and William L Loomis, 40, were arrested Saturday on the way to a protest in downtown Las Vegas after filling gas cans at a parking lot and making Molotov cocktails in glass bottles, according to a criminal complaint.

Federal prosecutors say the three white men with US military experience are accused of conspiring to carry out a plan that began in April in conjunction with protests to reopen businesses closed because of the coronavirus.

More recently, they sought to capitalize on protests over the death of George Floyd, a black man who died in Minneapolis after a white officer pressed his knee into his neck for several minutes even after he stopped moving and pleading for air, prosecutors said.

'People have a right to peacefully protest. These men are agitators and instigators. Their point was to hijack the protests into violence,' Nicholas Trutanich, US attorney in Nevada, told the Associated Press. He referred to what he called 'real and legitimate outrage' over Floyd's death.

The complaint filed in US District Court in Las Vegas on Wednesday said they self-identified as part of the 'boogaloo' movement, which prosecutors said in the document is 'a term used by extremists to signify coming civil war and/or fall of civilization'.

The suspects - Stephen T Parshall, Andrew Lynam and William L Loomis - were arrested Saturday on the way to a protest in downtown Las Vegas after filling gas cans at a parking lot and making Molotov cocktails in glass bottles, according to a criminal complaint. Authorities released the photo above of the Molotov cocktails

The three suspects were each being held on $1million bond each in the Clark County jail Wednesday, according to court records.

The complaint said Lynam is an Army reservist, with Parshall formerly enlisted in the Navy and Loomis formerly enlisted in the Air Force.

Each currently faces two federal charges - conspiracy to damage and destroy by fire and explosive, and possession of unregistered firearms.

In state court, they've been accused of felony conspiracy, terrorism and explosives possession. Trutanich said they'll be prosecuted in both jurisdictions.

'This type of planning and intent on causing mayhem is terroristic and will not be tolerated,' said Steve Wolfson, the district attorney in Las Vegas.

Attorney Monti Levy, representing Loomis, declined to comment about the state case and did not immediately respond to a question about whether she'll represent Loomis in federal court.

A deputy public defender representing Parshall declined to comment and an attorney appointed to represent Lynam did not immediately respond to messages.

Prosecutors said Parshall, Lynam and Loomis sought to capitalize on protests over the death of George Floyd, a black man who died in Minneapolis after a white officer pressed his knee into his neck for several minutes during an arrest last week. Police are seen patrolling the streets of Las Vegas after deploying tear gas to clear crowds on May 30

A confidential informant met Lynam and Parshall at an early April rally in Las Vegas calling for the reopening of the state's economy, the federal complaint said.

The men were carrying firearms and Lynam said the group 'was not for joking around and that it was for people who wanted to violently overthrow the United States government', according to the complaint.

The informant said that during a May 27 meeting, Parshall and Loomis 'discussed causing an incident to incite chaos and possibly a riot, in response to the death of a suspect,' a reference to Floyd.

Loomis stated he wanted to firebomb a power substation, according to the informant in the criminal complaint.

What is the 'boogaloo' movement? The anti-government 'boogaloo' movement is a loose network of gun enthusiasts who often express support for overthrowing the US government. Its name, a reference to a 1984 movie sequel called Breakin' 2: Electric Boogaloo, is a code word for a second civil war. The movement is rooted in online meme culture, but the coronavirus pandemic has become a catalyst for real-world activity. Many 'boogaloo' followers have shown up at COVID-19 lockdown protests armed with rifles and wearing tactical vests over Hawaiian shirts and leis, a nod to the 'big luau' derivation of the movement's name. While some 'boogaloo' promoters insist they aren't genuinely advocating for violence, law-enforcement officials say they have foiled bombing and shooting plots by people who have connections to the movement or at least used its terminology. The current boogaloo movement was noticed by extremism researchers in 2019. From November 2019 into 2020 boogaloo-related chatter has increased nearly 50 percent on platforms like Reddit and Twitter.

But on May 28, Lynam instructed the group to observe the riots occurring nationwide and use that momentum as a driving force to possibly take action against a fee station at Lake Mead on federal land north of the Hoover Dam, on May 30.

Other targets discussed included a US Forest Service ranger station, the complaint said.

The informant stated that Loomis and Parshall's 'idea behind the explosion was to hopefully create civil unrest and rioting throughout Las Vegas'.

They wanted to use the momentum from riots occurring nationwide because of Floyd's death 'to hopefully stir enough confusion and excitement, that others see the explosions and police presence and begin to riot in the streets out of anger,' the complaint said.

On May 28-29, FBI agents observed Parshall buy fireworks at a tribal travel plaza, and he indicated to the informant that he had glass bottles, rags and gasoline Molotov cocktails, the complaint said.

On May 30, all three and the informant agreed to take part in the Black Lives Matter protest in downtown Las Vegas, the complaint said.

The charges come as intelligence officials are warning that 'violent opportunists' have been emboldened nationwide by attacks on law enforcement officials amid protests.

In a Tuesday internal intelligence assessment, US Department of Homeland Security officials warned 'this could lead to an increase in potentially lethal engagements with law enforcement officials as violent opportunists increasingly infiltrate ongoing protest activity'.

AP obtained a copy of the document, which cites the shooting of a Las Vegas police officer during protests, and two other officers shooting a heavily armed man at a nearby federal courthouse.

'Law enforcement officers continue to be the primary targets of firearm attacks, though several incidents last night involved violent opportunists shooting into crowds of protesters,' the assessment states.",Three 'boogaloo' men face terrorism charges after 'plotting to spark violence' at Las Vegas protests,1

An analysis by the Washington Post found that at least 24 of those who received clemency from Trump are now backing his campaign with donations or public appearances on his behalf.

During his term, Trump signed 238 clemency orders. That's a relatively low number compared to most modern presidents, though Trump was criticized for focusing clemency on people in his personal or political orbit.

Additionally, Trump frequently bypassed previously standard Justice Department screening and review processes, instead doling out pardons to allies, or convicts whose causes were championed by celebrities.

Now, many of his most high-profile clemency grantees are returning the favor, including former Illinois Governor Rod Blagojevich, rapper Lil Wayne, and former Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio, the Post found.

Blagojevich, a lifelong Democrat convicted of public corruption, now calls himself a die-hard 'Trumpocrat' and champions Trump in media interviews.

Lil Wayne, born Dwayne Michael Carter Jr, was facing a federal firearms charge when Trump pardoned him as one of his final acts in office. The rapper responded by endorsing Trump in his lyrics.

Arpaio, convicted of disobeying a judge's order to stop profiling Hispanics, was one of Trump's first pardons, and is now a vocal Trump supporter as he also campaigns for mayor of Fountain Hills, Arizona.

Other Trump pardon recipients have donated to his campaign, boosted him in media interviews, and one even works for his campaign, the Post found.

Some of the pardon beneficiaries were close Trump allies well before the grants of clemency, including Mike Flynn, Paul Manafort, Steve Bannon and Roger Stone.

Several clemency recipients told the Post they would be supporting Trump now regardless of whether he had intervened on their behalf, including Arpaio, who said: 'He reflects what I believe in.'

Trump himself has touted the presidential pardon power as 'a beautiful thing' and has suggested he will pardon many of his supporters who were charged in the January 6, 2021 US Capitol riot.

Former NYPD Commissioner Bernie Kerik and author Angela Stanton have both backed Trump after receiving pardons

Overall, Trump granted less than 2 percent of clemency petitions filed during his term, a rate lower than any president since 1900 with the exception of George W. Bush, according to Pew Research.

But his concentration of pardons on allies drew fury from critics, similar to the blowback Bill Clinton faced for his infamous pardon of fugitive financier Marc Rich, whose ex-wife had made substantial donations to Clinton's presidential library.

Following the Clinton pardon scandal, George W. Bush made only sparing use of the pardon, issuing clemency just 200 times.

One that drew fire was his commutation of the sentence of former Dick Cheney aide Scooter Libby for his role in the Valerie Plame CIA leak scandal. But he resisted pressure from his vice president to issue a full pardon.

It would be Trump who would issue a full pardon for Libby in 2018, at a time when the Robert Mueller probe was in full swing.

Barack Obama boosted grants of clemency dramatically, giving 1,927, but still granting just 5 percent of requests amid a huge spike in clemency petitions during his term.

However, Obama steered clear of pardoning people close to him, although drew some controversy for the commutation of Chelsea Manning's sentence following a massive security leak.

The Metropolitan Police also employed the courageous K9s in the summer riots which tore through the country after the tragic Southport stabbings at the end of July.

But animal activists say dogs should not be used in efforts to combat crime because they are ending up as collateral damage far too often.

Campaigners decided enough is enough following injuries to canines on the front line and say the use of animals must be 'phased out' and replaced with a more ethical alternative.

The Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police has been encouraged to 'phase out the use of dogs' amid rising risks to their welfare and improvements in technology that can see their roles replaced.

It is the first time the organisation has requested UK police forces reconsider the age-old practice of training and using dogs to assist them in their work, for which the furry officers are crucial.

German shepherd Finn won the hearts of the nation for his selfless actions and even had a law named after him.

He saved the life of PC Dave Wardell, from Hertfordshire, when a robbery suspect turned on them with a hunting knife in 2016.

The officer was injured on his hand and the dog suffered serious stab wounds to the chest and head - but Finn refused let go until back up arrived.

Vets thought Finn would die from his injuries but he fought through, recovered and returned to duty, before he retired in 2017.

Finn was honoured with the PDSA Gold Medal for his bravery.

At the time, only criminal damage charges could be brought over the injuries to Finn.

But he was involved in the campaign that led to the Animal Welfare (Service Animals) Act 2019 which changes this - nicknamed Finn's Law - and he was at Westminster when it was cleared in Parliament.

Police dog Ozzy was also awarded the PDSA Gold Medal for his bravery and life-saving actions disarming an armed assailant threatening to blow up a block of flats.

Before his retirement, nine-year-old PD Ozzy worked for Police Scotland. In 2015, Ozzy and his handler, Police Constable Brian Tennant, were called to an incident at a flat in Falkirk, where a man had assaulted two people at knifepoint.

On arrival, they discovered the man had severed a gas pipe and was threatening to blow up the building.

The occupants of the flats were evacuated, leaving PC Tennant and PD Ozzy able to enter the building. The armed assailant charged at them, shouting threats, while attempting to ignite the gas with a lighter.

After warning the assailant, PC Tennant released Ozzy, who bravely tackled the man to the ground, where he was disarmed and arrested.

PD Ozzy's intervention prevented the man from harming himself, potentially others and causing extensive damage to the building.

In 2016, PD Eva jumped through a police car's open window and barked as she raced towards a suspect.

Two human police officers were struggling to detain the man who was thought to be armed.

She jumped at his chest and threw the man off balance, which gave the officers the chance to detain him. A knife was later said to have been discovered at the scene.

The animal has not only saved his life in a physical sense, protecting him and other officers from a petrol cannon in 2016, but also gave him a new lease of life when is mental health was declining.

Father-of-two Gareth told on This Morning that at his lowest he was struggling to deal with grief and the pressures of work, but was 'brought back to base line' by Theo and his two children.

He said: 'One of the major problems with men and police officers is we don't discuss our mental health, and we are human.

'I've been struggling along time, a lot was going on in my life a lot of pressures. I'd lost a lot of people and my life had changed, the pressures of work were very difficult.

'We struggle all the time and at my darkest moment, I always thought about my two children obviously, that would always bring me back to base line.

'But one of the fundamental factors was that night when I left home, if I didn't return home, who would let him out? Who would feed him?'

Theo and Gareth were chasing a man who has stabbed a woman and shown intent to harm his children at the end of a night shift in 2016.

At the scene there were two officers were remaining a distance away from the agitated man, who was armed with a petrol cannon and a knife.

After the man launched the cannon Theo launched himself in front of the officers, and while still on fire chased after the man who was still carrying his knife and latched onto his leg with his teeth.

'He tackled an individual armed with a petrol cannon and a knife', explained Gareth.

'He put himself in the way and he ended up being set on fire and even when he was on fire came back and defended us all. His loyalty knows no bounds'.

Theo is now retired, but that doesn't stop him wanting to go out into the Line of Duty and Gareth explained he has to 'sneak out of the house' in his uniform, so that his dog doesn't know he's going to work.

Asked about the way the dogs work, he said: 'It's all planned reward, the training, they associate the smell with finding a tennis ball.

'That's what he thinks in his mind he'll be getting at the end of each search. They wouldn't do it if they didn't want to. It's pretty much a game to them.'

The dogs would assist German soldiers in detecting enemy movements in the trenches from distances that aren't possible for a humans. They also aided wounded soldiers and carried supplies.

There are now more than 2,500 dogs used by police in the UK, according to estimates, with the Met alone having about 400.

Dogs are used by a range of forces for a many different purposes including tracking suspects, riot control, bomb and drug detection, and search and rescue.

The Alsatian is still the most common general purpose police dog and some are also trained as specialist urban search and rescue dogs.

Josh Shapiro for trying to downplay President Joe Biden's statement saying that 'Trump supporters are garbage.'

In an interview with Shapiro, Collins asked him about Biden's response to comedian Tony Hinchcliffe calling Puerto Rico a 'floating island of garbage' at Donald Trump's Madison Square Garden rally on Sunday.

While speaking with a Latino advocacy group on Tuesday, Biden said 'the only garbage I see floating out there is his supporters.'

Shapiro said that was the first time he heard Biden's comment.

'I would never insult the good people of Pennsylvania or any Americans even if they chose to support a candidate that I didn't support,' he said.

CNN host Kaitlan Collins asked Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro about President Biden's remarks during an interview Tuesday

Biden spoke to a Latino advocacy group and responded to comedian Tony Hinchcliffe's comment about Puerto Rico

'I think the real issue here is Donald Trump and his inability to simply say comments like that are wrong - to simply stand up for his fellow Americans. He is incapable of doing that.'

The governor then shifted the conversation to Trump and how he 'divided' people, describing the Republican presidential nominee as 'dangerous.'

Collins questioned the White House's attempt at damage control following the remark by releasing a transcript stating the president said 'supporter's' - referring to Hinchcliffe - instead of 'supporters.'

'It's hard to really look at that when you can listen to it for yourself,' Collins said of the transcript.

Shapiro waved after speaking on the third day of the Democratic National Convention

She then asked Shapiro: 'Do you think the president needs to come out and clarify that comment?'

The governor responded: 'I think President Biden will decide what he wants to say.

'It's certainly not words I would choose. I think it's important that we remain focused on the contrast between Kamala Harris and Donald Trump and not attacking supporters of either candidate.'

The Trump campaign has broken its silence over Hinchcliffe's controversial comment, with spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt telling Fox & Friends: 'It was a diverse group of people. The joke fell flat.

'Look, it was a comedian who made a joke in poor taste.

Collins attended TIME100 in New York City. The host is known for criticizing Fox News and Republicans

'Obviously, that joke does not reflect the views of President Trump or our campaign.'

Trump fired back at Biden on Tuesday for the president's remark.

'Wow, that's what [Biden] says… garbage. I think it's worse [than deplorables],' he said at a rally, referring to Hillary Clinton's now-infamous 2016 rant about the 'basket of deporables' who supported Trump during his first run.

'Please forgive him for he knoweth not what he say,' Trump added. 'Honestly he doesn't. And I'm convinced that he likes me more than he likes Kamala.'

Collins is known for her frequent clashes with Fox News and top Republicans.

Earlier this month, she called out Fox's Bret Baier for how he conducted an interview with Harris.

Collins took particular issue with how her broadcast news colleague presented Trump's claims that the 'enemy within' the U.S. is more dangerous to him than external and foreign threats.

She has previously been criticized for being too easy on Democrats making disputed claims about Trump.

In an August interview with Gov. Shapiro, Collins asked him about Trump's claim that antisemitism caused Shapiro to be passed up as Harris' running mate.

'Donald Trump has absolutely no credibility to speak on that issue,' Shapiro said. 'He is a person who has acted bigoted, he is a person who spreads hate.'

Collins interviewed Shapiro in September after the presidential debate between Kamala Harris and Donald Trump

He brought up Trump's reaction to the Charlottesville riot in 2017, saying that Trump responded to neo-Nazis chanting 'Jews will not replace us' by saying 'there are good people on both sides. There were not good people on both sides!'

One protestor said he was left with facial scars after allegedly being assaulted by an officer, while another claimed she was left 'struggling to breathe' when she was crushed beneath two riot shields.

Lee Guy, 34, Flora Sidebottom, 23, Luke Wentworth, 33, and two others were awarded damages after attending the peaceful demonstration on College Green on March 23 last year.

The force have confirmed they settled the claims - for an undisclosed amount - but had not admitted liability, adding that they continues to dispute the accounts and insist the officers' actions were not unlawful.

None of the five claimants were arrested nor have they been charged with any criminal offences.

The protest was one of many taking place across the country in opposition to the Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Bill - which the group said they feared would discriminate against the Gypsy, Roma and Traveller communities.

Luke Wentworth, 33, was among five protestors to be awarded damages after attending the peaceful demonstration

The parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights described parts of the Bill affecting GRT communities as 'likely to be in breach of the right to respect for private and family life … [and] in contravention of the requirement … that human rights and freedoms be secured without discrimination.'

After a day of peaceful protest, large numbers of police officers from Avon and Somerset and surrounding forces, dressed in body armour and carrying shields, forced the protestors off the Green, bringing the demonstration to an abrupt end.

All the protestors in the legal settlement alleged they were either assaulted or put in fear of police violence.

Mobile phone footage shows one protestor included in the settlement being dragged along the ground by his hair. Lee Guy claims he was struck in the face with a riot shield and was left with scars.

None of the five claimants were arrested nor have they been charged with any criminal offences.

The bill also planned to introduce a range of anti-protest measures - such as the ability to impose 'conditions' on any protest which is deemed to be disruptive to the local community and up to 10 years in prison for damaging memorials, such as statues.

This bill sparked outrage across the country and for many months saw cities across the UK filled with chants as thousands joined 'Kill The Bill' protests.

In a video taken on the day, Luke Wentworth can be seen speaking with officers earlier in the evening saying 'we don't want to have a rave here. We don't want to turn this into a festival we don't want bad press.

'It is really important for us that this goes nicely. Not only with the local community and with the media but also with you guys'.

Despite agreeing to pay damages the police have refused to admit liability or apologise.

Lee Guy, a visual artist and musician, said: 'The protest had been so peaceful all day, which was really important to us. We wanted to show the police and the public that we weren't hooligans and we weren't a threat.

'We were there to make a serious point about a way of life that is under threat. So it was really shocking to be confronted with rows of police officers in riot gear pushing and hitting us.

The Bill significantly widens the range of situations in which police officers can place conditions on protests - e.g. on any protest which is deemed to be disruptive to the local community and up to 10 years in prison for damaging memorials, such as statues. It was passed by the Houses of Parliament on 26 April 2022 and received Royal Assent on 28 April 2022. Previous amendments were defeated by the government including efforts to remove discrimination against travellers and measures which some fear may compound racism in policing and disproportionately impact marginalised groups. The government agreed a requirement for the Home Secretary to conduct a review of the new powers within two years. Advertisement

'People were sitting on the ground with their hands in the air saying peaceful protest but they still got hit. I was trying to leave the Green when a police officer smashed me in my face with his shield for no reason at all.

'I hope this settlement will remind all police forces that they need to respect the right to peaceful protest, because they'll be held accountable if they don't.'

Flora Sidebottom, a teaching assistant, said: 'The atmosphere at the protest had been lovely, people were singing songs and doing circus skills.

'Lots of people were wearing masks and there was hand sanitiser available. I couldn't believe it when the riot police turned up and started attacking people. At one point I was crushed under two riot shields and I felt like I couldn't breathe. One officer even pulled my face mask off, which was really shocking as they had forced us so close together.

'I've been to quite a few demonstrations over the years but I've never experienced that kind of violence from the police. I was covered in bruises afterwards. It's totally undermined my confidence in the police as somewhere I could go for protection if I needed it.'

A police spokesperson said: 'We can confirm Avon and Somerset Police has settled claims brought by five people in relation to the decision to disperse them from College Green, Bristol, on 23 March 2021, when Covid-19 restrictions were in place.

'Several allegations were made as part of the various claims. Those allegations were denied by Avon and Somerset Police and each of the settlements were made without admission of liability.'

Luke Wentworth, an artist, added: 'As one of the older people at the protests I felt quite a lot of responsibility to make sure that things went smoothly and there wasn't any repeat of the trouble we had seen at the other Kill the Bill demos.

'That's why I made a point of searching out officers earlier in the evening and trying to build a dialogue with them. I wanted them to understand that we would work with them to make sure there wasn't any need for the police to get heavy handed, but when it came down to it they just ignored me and stormed in anyway.

The bill sparked outrage across the country and for many months saw cities across the UK filled with chants as thousands joined 'Kill The Bill' protests. Pictured: Police and protesters at College Green in Bristol on March 23, 2021

'It was horrible to see, and I felt like I had let the other protestors down, particularly the young ones who were obviously really upset.

'I just couldn't believe that we had been entirely peaceful, we were speaking with the police, and they still decided to treat us like a mob.'

In legal correspondence with the public law and human rights department at the law firm Irwin Mitchell, which represents the protesters, they argued that the senior officer in charge of policing the demonstration on 23 March 2021 acted unlawfully when they failed to consider whether it was 'necessary and proportionate' to clear the demonstration by force.

The protestors' lawyers argued that the police had failed to consider issues including the actual health risks posed by the demonstration continuing, the health risks arising from using force to clear the demonstration, and the options for engaging with protestors so as to avoid a forcible dispersal.",Police force pay damages to five 'Kill the Bill' protesters after one claimed he was hit with shield,1

George Floyd mattered. His life had value and we will seek justice for him and for you and we will find it Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison

Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison said at a press conference on Wednesday afternoon: 'I strongly believe these developments are in the interest of justice for Mr Floyd, his family, this community and this state.'

He said he did not allow public pressure to influence his decision and warned it would be 'months' before he and his team build a 'solid' enough case to go to trial.

A fatal shooting and lawsuit for excessive force: What we know about the four officers charged in George Floyd's murder Derek Chauvin Derek Chauvin The white police officer who knelt on George Floyd's neck has already been investigated over three police shootings and a fatal car chase. In 2006 Derek Chauvin, 44, was one of six officers connected to the death of Wayne Reyes. Reyes, 42 was killed by officers after allegedly pulling a shotgun on the six cops, which included Chauvin. Two years later Chauvin was investigated for his role in the 2008 shooting of Ira Latrell Toles during a domestic assault call. Toles was wounded after police said he went for an officer’s gun and Chauvin shot him. And in 2011 23-year-old Leroy Martinez was shot and injured during a chase given by officers including Chauvin. Tou Thao Tou Thao Tou Thao, was part of a $25,000 out of court settlement after being sued for using excessive force in 2017. A lawsuit obtained by the DailyMail.com shows Thao was sued for using excessive force in arrest where he was accused of punching and kicking a handcuffed suspect 'until his teeth broke'. The remaining two officers Thomas Lane and J Alexander Kueng were reportedly rookie cops who were still in their probationary periods. Advertisement

At his press conference, Ellison thanked the public for giving him time to bring the charges.

'I asked for time for to review all the evidence. The investigation is ongoing at this time. I know it's asking a lot of people to give us time and yet we did get that time.

'Together, a very strong experienced team, we reviewed the evidence and we have something to announce today.

'Thank you for the patience of the people they've shown me in pursuit of justice,' he said.

He added that the case was under investigation and asked for anyone with evidence to come forward with it.

'We are investigating as quickly as we can and as thoroughly as we can. Every single link in the prosecutorial chain must be strong.

'Trying this case will not be an easy thing.

'I say this not because we doubt our resources or our ability but history does show there are clear challenges here and we are going to be working very hard to support that endeavor.

'To the Floyd family, I say: George Floyd mattered. His life had value and we will seek justice for him and for you and we will find it.

'The very fact that we have filed these charges means that we believe in it.'

He warned the investigation would take 'months' and said he wanted to build a 'solid case' and not rush a trial.

'It will take a while and I can't set a deadline on that, he said.

Ellison added that the charges being brought should not bring an end to the global outrage over injustice that Floyd's death has caused.

'A protest can shake a tree and make the fruit fall down but after that fruit is in reach, collecting it and making the jam must follow.

'The demonstrations and protests are dramatic and necessary but building just institutions is more of a slow grind. We have to begin that work now,' he said.

The Floyd family called the charges a 'bittersweet moment'. They wanted Chauvin to be hit with first-degree murder charges.

All four cops were fired when the video surfaced last week but the three others were not charged initially, to the dismay of Floyd and protesters around the world who say they complicit because they did nothing to prevent Floyd's death.

The case was taken out of the hands of Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman and handed over to Minnesota AG Keith Ellison earlier this week after a groundswell of outrage over how the case had been handled to date.

Ellison's office vowed to carry out a full overhaul of the investigation, including whether Chauvin's charges should be upgraded from third-degree murder to first-degree murder.

The new development came as Floyd's adult son - Quincy Mason Floyd - visited the site where his father died. Crump also told reporters that he'd been informed a decision on the case had been reached.

Both Chauvin and Thao had been complained about for their use of force in the past.

Tou Thao, was part of a $25,000 out of court settlement after being sued for using excessive force in 2017.

A lawsuit obtained by the DailyMail.com shows Thao was sued for using excessive force in an arrest where he was accused of punching and kicking a handcuffed suspect 'until his teeth broke'.

In 2006 Derek Chauvin, 44, was one of six officers connected to the death of Wayne Reyes.

Reyes, 42 was killed by officers after allegedly pulling a shotgun on the six cops, which included Chauvin.

Two years later Chauvin was investigated for his role in the 2008 shooting of Ira Latrell Toles during a domestic assault call.

Toles was wounded after police said he went for an officer’s gun and Chauvin shot him.

And in 2011 23-year-old Leroy Martinez was shot and injured during a chase given by officers including Chauvin. Lane and Keung are reportedly rookies.

The announcement on Wednesday comes after more than a week of civil unrest across the United States which has seen thousands of peaceful protests, a social media blackout in the name of racial justice, and out-of-control looting and violence.

The unrest began last week in Minneapolis - where Floyd was killed - but it quickly spread across the nation and sparked conversations of police brutality and racial inequality around the world.

Floyd was accused of using a forged $20 bill to pay for something when the police were called on him.

The 46-year-old father begged for his life as Chauvin knelt on his neck without flinching.

The three other cops held Chauvin restrain him despite him pleading for breath and saying his chest and neck hurt.

A video of the incident that was filmed by disgusted bystanders went viral and sparked the investigation into the police officers.

Initially, they were only fired. Chauvin was then charged but unsatisfied critics demanded the others be brought to justice.

President Trump has been widely criticized for his response to the national row which has to been to order governors to take a tougher stance in their handling of the crisis.

He has been urging Governors to utilize the military and take as tough a stance as possible.

Earlier this week, he hid in a bunker in the White House as protesters threw objects at Secret Service agents.

He then had protesters cleared with tear gas to walk over to a church in Washington DC for a photo-opp.

Trump was particularly critical of New York City which he said was 'totally out of control.

After scrambling to keep up with looters on Monday night, NYPD officers - who all had their leave canceled on Tuesday - were seen arresting protesters for breaking curfew on Tuesday all over Manhattan.

They blocked a huge protest on the Manhattan Bridge, stopping some 5,000 marchers who planned to enter the city from Brooklyn.

After holding the protesters on the bridge for more than two hours in a tense stand-off, the protesters retreated peacefully back into Brooklyn.

Some businesses, still unwilling to put their faith in the NYPD, have hired private security.

Saks Fifth Avenue on Wednesday was surrounded by a militia of private, armed guards. They held dogs on leashes and stood in front of plywood walls that had been reinforced with razor wire to protect the luxury department store.

'Anyone who is out and cannot prove they are there for essential reasons can be detained,' Mayor de Blasio said on Wednesday morning, warning against anyone who thinks they can flout the curfew.

Mayor Bill de Blasio said on Wednesday that the situation overnight was a vast improvement on the previous 48 hours.

Trump claimed on Tuesday that the city was 'totally out of control'. On Wednesday, he said the National Guard was 'ready'.

Gov. Cuomo was hesitant to call in the Guard as was de Blasio. They both said the NYPD could handle it in a better way.

On Wednesday, Cuomo said: 'New York City last night was much better. The police officers had the resources and capacity to do their jobs. The results last night were much, much better than the night before.

'The people of New York City should feel much better today than they did after the night of looting.'

Terrence Floyd, George Floyd's brother, on Wednesday joined NYPD Commisisioner Shea at a press conference where he warned looters: 'Don't do it in the name of George Floyd.

'You're disrespecting his legacy.

'We have an issue in New York City, which is a good thing in terms of having a relationship and bridging the gap in this hostile environment.

'Now, we can have a voice and turn something negative into a conversation that can lead to positive,' he said.

Ten protests are scheduled to take place across the city between 1pm and 7pm, including one at Gracie Mansion, where de Blasio lives.

The calmer scenes in New York City were echoed across much of America where protesters once again turned out in force but the confrontations with police were subdued and widespread rioting was limited.

It followed a day of anger from President Trump's critics over the way he threatened to deploy the military to quell riots across the US and cleared protesters in Washington DC so he could visit damaged St John's Episcopal Church.

He also considered using 'tanks' or other armored military vehicles to help restore order in the US after violent protests broke out across the country for a sixth night, defense officials have revealed.

This morning the president repeated his demand for 'LAW & ORDER!', urged police to 'get tough' and responded to an image of a boarded-up Manhattan with a warning that 'the National Guard is ready'.

As night fell, groups of curfew-violators and looters around the city were rounded up and handcuffed by officers before being loaded on to NYPD vans.



Police began making arrests around 9pm and shut down parts of the West Side Highway in lower Manhattan, blocking it off to huge crowds of protesters.

The police department had announced it would not allow vehicle traffic south of 96th Street in Manhattan after curfew, though residents, essential workers, buses and truck deliveries were exempt.

'Currently stuck on the Manhattan Bridge. NYPD told us the would let us through 'in 10 min' - that was 40 min ago.

'They now brought in multiple vans to barricade us in from both sides. They are all wearing riot gear. We have been nothing but peaceful,' one woman tweeted.

'Daddy changed the world': George Floyd's six-year-old daughter Gianna says she misses playing with him as her mother reveals she does not yet know he was killed by cops but that he died 'because he couldn't breathe'

George Floyd's six-year-old daughter Gianna has been told her 'daddy changed the world' but still does not know he was killed by cops.

The six-year-old and her mother Roxie Washington appeared on Good Morning America on Wednesday morning where Gianna, bright-eyed and smiling, said she misses playing with her father.

She said she wants to grow up to become a doctor and wants to 'take care of people.'

'I miss him... he played with me,' Gianna said.

Roxie, who took part in a press conference with her daughter on Tuesday night, said George 'loved' his daughter, one of his two children.

'He will never see her grow up, graduate, he will never walk her down the aisle. If there's a problem and she needs her dad, she does not have that anymore.

'I'm here for my baby and I'm here for George because I want justice for him.

'He was good, no matter what anybody thinks, he was good. This is the proof.'

Washington recalled how excited Floyd was when his daughter was born, saying: 'He was so happy to have her.'

'He slept the whole time I was in labor, but when he heard her cry, he woke up,' she said.

'I still have a picture of him waking up and getting his baby. He loved her. He loved her so much.'

As Washington and Gianna stepped back from the microphone, Floyd's longtime friend Stephen Jackson approached and placed his hands on the podium.

The former NBA player stared at the floor for several seconds in silence before saying: 'It really don't make no sense. We all seen it plain as day.

He then motioned toward the media and said: 'Y'all in here with cameras to record what's in here so you can have it for later. So you can have proof of what happened today. Right?

'When you post that footage on your news station, you expect people to believe what you're posting and what you videoed is real, right?

'Why is it not that simple when someone is getting videoed and getting murdered? Why is it not that simple?'

She also said she has only seen some parts of the infamous video of Derek Chauvin kneeling on Floyd's neck for eight minutes and 46 seconds, and that she wishes she'd been there to help him.

'I couldn't believe somebody was doing him like that I wish somebody would have been there to help him,' she said.

Roxie also revealed Gianna does not know the full story behind her father's death.

The family turned out to join peaceful protests in Minneapolis on Tuesday as others took place around the country in Floyd's name.

They urged people to protest peacefully against police brutality and rebuked violent looters and rioters giving the cause a bad name.

Unrest has unfolded across America since Floyd's death last Monday.

At a press conference on Tuesday night, Roxie said: 'I don't have a lot to say, I can't get the words together right now.

'I want everyone to know that this is what those officers took from me,' she said, referencing the small girl standing next to her.

Among them is an investigation of President Joe Biden's son Hunter over tax matters, an an investigation into alleged FBI misconduct during the Russia probe – which Trump regularly called a 'witch hunt' while demanding those who went after him be 'locked up.'

The Hunter Biden probe is 'active and ongoing,' two sources told Fox News last week.

New Attorney General Merrick Garland told DOJ employees Thursday they will will show the nation that the 'Department of Justice pursues equal justice, and adheres to the rule of law'

'All of us are united by our commitment to the rule of law, and to seek equal justice under law. We are united by our commitment to protecting our country, as our oath says, from all enemies, foreign and domestic. And by our commitment to enforcing our country's laws and to ensuring the civil rights and civil liberties of our people,' said Garland.

He spoke a day after two DOJ whistleblowers wrote lawmakers and an IG claiming a top Trump political appointee relied on politics to elevate a favored employee to a high-level post in the final days of the Trump administration.

They accuse Jeffrey Bossert Clark, who reportedly spoke about aiding Trump's effort to overturn the election results, of conducting a 'sham' job search. He claimed a New York Times report about his actions on the election overturn distorted his statements.

He did not mention the controversy that that wracked the agency during the tenures of AG's Jeff Sessions and Bill Barr, as well as acting AG Matthew Whitaker.

Before leaving the agency shortly before Christmas, former AG Bill Barr designated U.S. Attorney John Durham as special counsel for a probe into alleged FBI misconduct, protecting him from firing other than for cause.

Garland, the former top justice on the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals, was confirmed on a bipartisan 70-30 vote Wednesday. He never got a hearing when Barack Obama nominated him for the Supreme Court.

'The only way we can succeed and retain the trust of the American people, has to adhere to the norms that have become part of the DNA of every Justice Department employee,' Garland said, referencing predecessor Edward Levy, who served as AG after Watergate.

'As I said at the announcement of my nomination, those norms require that light cases be treated alike. That they're not being one rule for Democrats, and another for Republicans. One rule for friends and another for foes, one rule for the powerful and another for the powerless. One for the rich and another for the poor. Or different rules, depending upon one's race or ethnicity.

Demonstrators have gathered across the country to express their anger after it was announced that the officers who shot black woman Breonna Taylor in her Louisville, Kentucky apartment during a drug raid last March wouldn't be charged with her death.

In Portland, Oregon, 14 were arrested after protesters set fire to plywood attached to the front door of a police union building and clashed with officers.

Images posted online showed flames erupting outside the doors of the Portland Police Association office. Some protesters managed later to get on the roof of the building, police said in a statement on Friday.

The protesters who were detained were arrested on charges ranging from disorderly conduct to interfering with officers and trespassing.

In Portland protesters are pictured on Wednesday night throwing a petrol bomb at officers. Unrest continued on Thursday

In New York City, several hundred protesters marched through the Big Apple while chanting Taylor’s name, and in St Louis, crowds gathered to occupy several lanes of a freeway.

In Seattle, protesters locked off an intersection by hauling dumpsters on their side and setting them alight to build a barrier between them and the police, who had gathered on bicycles.

Footage shows the crowd of demonstrators launching projectiles towards the officers and them returning fire, before they charged down the retreating rioters.

Earlier last night, in New York City, large masses of demonstrators were seen in Manhattan’s Union Square as well as Brooklyn - carrying signs demanding authorities defund the police.

In Union Square, some 100 people gathered at around 5:30pm on Thursday. They then started marching west on 15th Street until they reached the area around the home of City Council Speaker Corey Johnson.

'And the reason why we are out on these streets is to let people know that the verdict they came to, that the conclusion that they came to is unacceptable!'

Meanwhile, protests were also staged in St. Louis, where crowds gathered outside police headquarters.

Although the demonstrations were peaceful, state officials aren't taking any chances in anticipation of the weekend.

Missouri Governor Mike Parson signed an executive order activating the state's National Guard 'as a precautionary measure in response to recent instances of civil unrest across the country,' the governor's office said in a news release Thursday.

'The National Guard, as well as the Missouri State Highway Patrol, stands ready to assist local law enforcement if necessary,' the release said.

'We fully support the right of citizens to peacefully protest and are committed to protecting that right. At this time, we are taking a proactive approach in the event that assistance is needed to support local law enforcement in protecting Missouri and its people,' Parson said in the release.

Meanwhile, at least one person was hurt when a vehicle ran into a small crowd of people protesting police brutality in Los Angeles Thursday night, authorities said.

A few minutes after that incident, a car drove through a crowd of several hundred protesters at another location in Los Angeles, KABC TV reported. Although there were no reports of injuries, protesters chased the driver, who was later detained by police.

In the first incident, which took place shortly before 9 p.m., an ambulance transported one patient to a hospital in unknown condition following the hit-and-run at Sunset Boulevard and Seward Street in Hollywood, Los Angeles Fire Department spokesman Nicholas Prange said.

About 30 minutes later, KCAL9 TV showed helicopter footage of a white sedan pushing slowly through a crowd of marchers blocking another intersection on Sunset.

A group of protesters in a black pickup truck chased down the white sedan and cut it off. They and another group of people in a green Mustang confronted the driver and banged on the sedan's windows before the car drove away, KABC reported.

The driver of the Prius managed to speed away from the scene and ran at least one red light in his attempt to get away, KABC reported.

Eventually police pulled over the vehicle on Santa Monica Boulevard and detained the driver.

It wasn't immediately known if anyone was hurt in the second incident.

There were no arrests. Los Angeles Police Officer J. Chavez said investigators were still gathering information about both incidents.

A few dozen demonstrators marched through Hollywood for hours on Thursday, one of many protests across the country demanding justice for Breonna Taylor.

Meanwhile, officials in Massachusetts are preparing for a large-scale protest in Boston on Friday evening.

Hundreds - perhaps thousands - are expected to attend a demonstration in Boston's Nubian Square at around 6pm on Friday.

At least four other protests are planned in Boston over the course of the weekend.

Massachusetts Governor Charles Baker signed an order on Thursday mobilizing the state's National Guard.

Baker's order calls up to 1,000 members of the Massachusetts National guard 'to provide necessary assistance to State and local civilian authorities and/or special duty and emergency assistance for the preservation of live and property, preservation of order, and to afford protection to persons.'

On Wednesday night, protesters in Portland hurled several firebombs at officers during a demonstration over the Taylor decision, escalating tensions in a city that's already seen nearly four months of nightly protests over racial injustice and police brutality.

Deputy Police Chief Chris Davis said Wednesday night's demonstrations were the most violent that Portland has seen thus far in four months of nearly nightly unrest since the death of George Floyd, a black man who died in Minnesota after a white officer held a knee to his neck.

Multnomah County District Attorney Mike Schmidt - who has been criticized for dismissing cases against hundreds of protesters - condemned the violence and called for calm.

Thirteen people were arrested during Wednesday's demonstration.

US agents with the Federal Protective Service, who were guarding a federal courthouse nearby, offered assistance and the Portland police accepted because it was an 'emergency need in the moment,' Davis said at a news conference Thursday.

'I can't say that just because last night was exceptionally violent that that's the beginning of a trend' he said.

'I certainly hope not.'

He added, 'We're at the mercy of people who show up ... and what they intend to do.'

No tear gas was used by local or federal law enforcement, Davis said.

Schmidt, the newly elected prosecutor who made waves this summer by deciding not to prosecute protesters arrested for lower-level, non-violent crimes, said a peaceful protest intended to honor Taylor was sabotaged by violence.

'I am thankful that no Portland police officers or Portland firefighters were injured,' he wrote in a statement Thursday.

'There is no justification for a person to ever throw an incendiary device, to set fire to buildings or to engage in other violent and destructive behavior.'

Those arrested included a 23-year-old man who was charged Thursday with riot and unlawful possession of a destructive device.

A probable cause affidavit filed Thursday in court says a police officer saw Joseph Robert Sipe light the firebomb's wick and throw it.

Sipe later said he had tossed the lighted device behind the police line as it advanced, according to the affidavit.

Sipe is identified in court papers as a homeless ex-Marine who has schizophrenia.

His public defender, Grant Hartley, didn't immediately return an email seeking comment.

Two other individuals were charged Thursday with squirting accelerant on barricaded doors at the police headquarters, throwing a firebomb that didn't explode and throwing rocks at windows.

The prosecutor said in a news release that an unidentified person dropped a backpack of rocks in the middle of the protest and people started throwing them.

The protesters Wednesday joined demonstrators around the US who were enraged that a grand jury didn't indict officers in the shooting of Taylor, a black woman who was shot to death in her Louisville home by officers conducting a drug investigation.

Police said protesters hurled three firebombs - also known as Molotov cocktails - at officers and threw rocks that shattered windows at a law enforcement precinct station.

One officer was hit in the foot by one of the firebombs and a fire department medic put out the flames.

Taylor, an emergency medical worker, was shot multiple times by white officers in Louisville who entered her home during a narcotics investigation in March.

The Kentucky grand jury returned three charges of wanton endangerment Wednesday against fired Louisville Officer Brett Hankison over shooting into a home next to Taylor's with people inside.

In Portland, demonstrators have taken to the streets almost every night for four months to protest police brutality and to demand a reduction in police funding.

A small number have frequently set fires, smashed windows and thrown objects at police.

More recently, protesters have targeted Portland Mayor Ted Wheeler for allowing police to use tear gas to disperse crowds and for what protesters believe are overly aggressive tactics.

Wheeler banned all use of tear gas last week.

At the same time, the mayor has become a frequent focus of attacks from President Donald Trump, who has accused him of being weak and doing nothing to stop the unrest in his city. Trump has made Portland a common theme in his 'law and order' reelection campaign.

The right-wing group Proud Boys plans a rally in Portland this Saturday to support Trump and the police and to condemn anti-fascists, what the group calls 'domestic terrorism' and Wheeler's leadership, according to their permit application.

The city denied the permit, citing the estimated crowd size of 10,000 during a pandemic, but police said Thursday they will not try to stop the Proud Boys from gathering at a park in north Portland.",BLM supporters take to the streets of the nation for the second night of Breonna Taylor protests,1

'Where is the evidence? Where is proof? It's becoming farcical,' Putin said in a sit-down interview with NBC's Keir Simmons in Moscow.

'We have been accused of all kinds of things - election interference, cyberattacks and so on and so forth - and not once, not once, not one time, did they bother to produce any kind of evidence or proof, just unfounded accusations,' he told the network's Kier Simmons.

'I'm surprised that we have not yet been accused of – provoking the Black Lives Matter movement. That would have been a good line of attack. But ...' Putin said, ridiculing the attack.

Then he waded further into U.S. domestic politics, saying: 'We have always treated with understanding the fight of African Americans for their rights,' but said he couldn't approve of any 'extreme' actions associated with the movement.

Russian President Vladimir Putin in an interview with NBC sharply dismissed allegations that his country is carrying out cyberattacks against the United States as baseless

Former Special Counsel Robert Mueller's team issued detailed indictments for Russian intelligence operatives accused of 2016 election interference. But Russia didn't hand over the alleged hackers, and they have not stood trial.

The U.S. government has said Russia may be housing cyber hackers who carried out the ransomware attack on Colonial Pipeline, but has not said it was a government operation.

U.S. intelligence does assess that Russia interfered in the 2016 and 2020 elections.

Putin's comments come as Biden kicked off the NATO summit in Brussels by saying Russia and China had not acted 'in a way that is consistent with what we had hoped.'

Vladimir Putin could be open to prisoner swap for jailed Americans Paul Whelan and 'troublemaker' Trevor Reed Putin also discussed the fate of two Americans held in Russia, Trevor Reed, a former Marine sentenced to nine years in prison for allegedly punching a Russian police officer, and Paul Whelan. Whelan, a former U.S. Marine was sentenced to 16 years in prison after being convicted of spying. ‘This secret trial in which no evidence was produced is an egregious violation of human rights and international legal norms,’ U.S. ambassador to Moscow John Sullivan said following Whelan’s conviction. Former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the U.S. was “outraged” over the ‘secret trial, with secret evidence, and without appropriate allowances for defense witnesses.” Whelan, who also holds passports from the U.S., Britain, Canada, and Ireland, denied the espionage charges. His lawyer said following his arrest at a Moscow hotel in late 2019 that Whelan had been given a flash drive containing ‘state secrets’ that someone handed him, but that he had not opened it or looked at its contents. He was expecting it to contain personal information. Secretary of State Anthony Blinken said President Biden would raise both cases when he meets with Putin, having already said he will be direct with the Russian leader. Putin indicated he was open to a potential prisoner swap, according to NBC. He called Reed was a ‘troublemaker,’ referring to him a ‘drunk’ who ‘got himself s**t-faced and started a fight."" Reed is an executive from Michigan. He and his family as well as his Russian girlfriend have denied the charges. Sullivan said following his conviction last year: ‘This is not a good story for U.S.-Russia relations. And it is not good for encouraging U.S. private citizens and business to visit and invest here if what they did to [Reed] can be done to anyone,’ NBC reported at the time. Advertisement

Putin once again sought to undermine a U.S. push the Kremlin to respect press freedoms and allow a sphere for political opponents to exist – by bringing up U.S. prosecution of rioters who stormed the Capitol Jan. 6th.

Putin, who is to meet President Joe Biden at a summit Wednesday, has suggested that the hundreds of people arrested for rioting at the U.S. Capitol are being subjected to 'persecution for political opinions.'

Charging documents reveal many of those who have been arrested were carrying sticks and poles, attacked police officers, or broke through windows to enter the seat of legislative power.

'We have a saying: ""Don't be mad at the mirror if you are ugly,""' Putin said.

'It has nothing to do with you personally. But if somebody blames us for something, what I say is, why don't you look at yourselves? You will see yourselves in the mirror, not us.'

Putin is likely to come under strong criticism from Biden at their meeting in Geneva for moves against his political opponents in Russia, particularly the imprisonment of opposition leader Alexei Navalny, the detention of thousands of demonstrators protesting his arrest, and the outlawing of Navalny´s organizations as extremist.

Anticipating that Biden will raise issues of human rights and the jailing of opposition leader Alexei Navalny, Putin said: 'You are presenting it as dissent and intolerance towards dissent in Russia. We view it completely differently.'

He then pointed to the Jan. 6 unrest in Washington when protesters barged into the Capitol to try to halt the count of electoral votes to certify Biden´s election victory over Donald Trump.

'Do you know that 450 individuals were arrested after entering the Congress? ... They came there with political demands,' he said.

Putin also reiterated denials that the Kremlin was behind last year's poisoning of Navalny with a nerve agent that nearly killed him.

'We don't have this kind of habit, of assassinating anybody,' Putin said.

'Did you order the assassination of the woman who walked into the Congress and who was shot and killed by a policeman?' Putin said, referring to Trump supporter Ashli Babbitt, who was fatally shot by a Capitol Police officer as she tried to climb through a window that led to the House floor.

In April, the United States announced the expulsion of 10 Russian diplomats and new sanctions connected to the so-called SolarWinds cyberattack in which several U.S. government branches experienced data breaches. U.S. officials blamed the Russian foreign intelligence service.

In May, Microsoft officials said the foreign intelligence service appeared to be linked to an attack on a company providing services to the U.S. Agency for International Development.

Over 1,500 people gathered last night for a vigil at the spot where Kyrees Sullivan, 16, and Harvey Evans, 15, died in a fatal crash that sparked furious riots in Cardiff.

Dozens of blue and orange flares were lit and balloons were released as family and friends gathered on Snowden Road where hundreds of floral tributes and messages have been left since the incident.

CCTV footage of a marked South Wales Police van following the teenagers as they rode a Sur-Ron electric bike quickly spread on social media after the incident, leading to violent clashes and disorder in Ely.

Speaking for the first time since the fatal crash on Monday evening, Harvey's aunt Hayley Murphy and grandmother Dawn Rees told the BBC the boy's mother had stood at the police barrier for more than two hours begging to know if her son and his friend were still alive.

The mothers of the teenagers asked that there be no people on Sur-Ron bikes, which the two boys had been riding before they died, at the vigil.

Ms Murphy said: 'We were stood at the barrier and we were begging them, begging them, to tell us if they were alive or dead, and they wouldn't tell us nothing - and then someone ran into the crowd and said 'I've got a video of the police chasing them', and that is what started it.

'That's what got everyone angry, so I understand because we wasn't getting no answers.'

The rioting saw nine people arrested and left 15 police officers injured.

Last night, people wore white T-shirts adorned with pictures of the two boys and carried blue balloons that were later released into the air.

They held a moment of silence before breaking out in applause, with some fireworks also being set off.

It is also understood that the families requested the police not be present.

Speaking at the vigil, one of Harvey's uncles said: 'We're all tarred with the same brush here, especially given what happened on Monday.

'But this is the true Ely. Look how many people have turned out to pay their respects.

'The only difference between Monday and today is that the police aren't here.'

John O'Driscoll, Harvey's great uncle, said: 'What happened on Monday with the riot, that was wrong, the boys were wrong. But it was out of frustration.

'It was because a lot of the boys get abused by the police around here and so that's why things kicked off.

'Harvey was my great nephew, we have a big family and we're all close.

'They were just young boys. Everyone rides bikes and scooters around here. Yes, we find them annoying but that's just what they do.

'But as soon as those coppers saw they had no helmets they should've stopped.'

Childhood best friends Kyrees and Harvey were fatally injured after they crashed in the suburb of Ely, Cardiff, at 6pm on Monday.

Their deaths sparked a riot that led to nine arrests and 15 officers being injured after rumours spread on social media that they were being pursued by the police.

The claims were later denied by Alun Michael, the Police and Crime Commissioner for South Wales.

But CCTV from the area has since emerged showing a marked police van following them less than two minutes before the crash.

The exact circumstances of the teenagers' deaths have not been established, but the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) said it had already carried out house-to-house inquiries.

The IOPC said it had recovered CCTV footage from the Ely area and is reviewing initial accounts from the police officers involved.

It said the investigation was examining the 'nature of the police interaction' with Kyrees and Harvey and the 'appropriateness' of the officers' decisions and actions.

The watchdog is also considering whether the police officers' actions in the van constituted a pursuit, and whether the interaction between the officers and the boys was 'reported appropriately by the officers prior to and following the collision'.

IOPC director David Ford: 'Our thoughts and sympathies remain with the family and friends of Kyrees and Harvey, as well as all those affected by the loss of two young lives in such a close-knit community as Ely.

'Our investigators have been conducting inquiries and securing evidence in the immediate vicinity of where the events took place, speaking to local residents, distributing leaflets and gathering as much relevant information as possible.

'I am truly grateful for the co-operation and assistance we have received from people within the local community.

'We are working hard to establish the exact circumstances of what took place in the period leading up to the collision. I would like to reassure everyone in the community that our work will be thorough, impartial, and independent of the police.'

Balloons were released into the sky in tribute to the teenagers and fireworks were set off

Hundreds of floral tributes and messages have been left since Monday where the crash occurred on Snowden Road

Earlier today, politicians and community leaders met to discuss the aftermath of Monday's tragedy.

First Minister Mark Drakeford said: 'This week, two families are grieving for their sons and the people of Ely have experienced a collective trauma.

'My thoughts are with the families and friends of Harvey and Kyrees.

'Representatives of the local community and public agencies, including Action in Caerau and Ely, the Welsh Government and Cardiff Council today met in Ely.

'We have agreed to jointly sponsor a grassroots-led initiative to create a community plan for Ely, to respond to the long-term needs of residents. It will be focused on actions and outcomes for people in Ely.'

A friend of the two boys' families said on Wednesday: 'I'm just absolutely devastated and heartbroken for my friends. My heart is hurting. That's the little boy I used to babysit and push around in a pram.

One video shows a police van following an e-bike less than two minutes before the accident that killed the two boys. This image shows the e-bike

A marked police van then follows behind the bike about one second later

'It is so, so sad. They both went to see their boys yesterday and they are both very numb and haven't got much to say at the moment.'

The friend said the original CCTV video of the 'chase', which has circulated on social media, supported claims a police van was following the pair on the day of the incident.

They believed the boys had got away from the police by riding up Stanwey Road, which is blocked off to traffic at one end, and had then ridden on to the adjacent Snowden Road where the crash happened.

South Wales Police are investigating claims of a pursuit but said the collision had already happened when the first officers arrived on the scene.

But the friend said: 'The reason why the police wasn't on the scene is because the boys have gone through a blocked street and the police knew they couldn't go that way so they have turned on v to Grand Avenue, which led the boys to cut through on to Stanway Road on to Snowden Road.

'The police have already stated they were on Grand Avenue and they were not on the scene. They weren't on the scene because they lost them.'

Red and blue flares were set off during the vigil

Several people were in tears as the balloons were released

According to the official police timeline the bike was being followed by the police van, with no blue flashing lights or siren, at 52 seconds past six on Monday evening.

The alleged chase ended at 18:02.31 when the marked police van turned into Grand Avenue.

Kyrees and Harvey were in a collision between 18:02.17 – 18:02.41 and died at the scene in Snowden Road.

The teenagers, from the suburb of Ely, were known for riding the e-bike around the streets despite a clampdown on illegal riding.

Friends described them as 'motorbike heads' who had grown up together on the tough estate in the west of Cardiff and were 'just enjoying themselves' when they died.

Harvey's godmother, Bridy Bool, said Harvey was 'a typical 15-year-old' who 'loved motorbikes, bikes and football' and who had eaten dinner with his mother Nadine just ten minutes before he died.

She insisted the boys had done nothing to spark a police 'chase', adding: 'They were bare-faced innocent children.'

One witness who caught the pair cycling on CCTV said they appeared scared of the vehicle, having 'panicked' and trying to flee after coming across it on the road.

At another vigil on Wednesday, Belinda Sullivan, mother of Kyrees, blasted the South Wales force, telling The Daily Telegraph: 'The police killed my son. I've got nothing else to say.'

A relative of Harvey told The Times: 'If they [police] see someone on a Sur-Ron [an e-bike brand], they think they are a drug dealer.

'The police told Harvey's family that there were no police vehicles in the area, they didn't get chased and there was no sighting of them. But there it is, it's all in the videos.'

One witness whose CCTV captured the moment they were forced to jump out of the way of the bike and the van as they drove past said both were travelling 'at speed'.

They told the newspaper: 'You could see the boys were panicking and trying to get away from them.'

A dozen officers were injured - none seriously - during the riots on Monday night.

Four males, aged 16, 17, 18 and 29 were arrested in Ely on Thursday, and one man aged 21 was arrested in Tremorfa, a suburb on the other side of the city.

They all remain in custody on suspicion of riot.

On the night of the riot and the following day, two 15-year-old boys from Ely and Llanrumney were arrested, as was a 15-year-old girl form Roath and a 16-year-old from Ely.

John O'Driscoll, Harvey's great uncle, said: 'What happened on Monday with the riot, that was wrong, the boys were wrong. But it was out of frustration.

'It was because a lot of the boys get abused by the police around here and so that's why things kicked off.

'Harvey was my great nephew, we have a big family and we're all close.

'They were just young boys. Everyone rides bikes and scooters around here. Yes, we find them annoying but that's just what they do.

'But as soon as those coppers saw they had no helmets they should've stopped.'

Childhood best friends Kyrees and Harvey were fatally injured after they crashed in the suburb of Ely, Cardiff, at 6pm on Monday.

Their deaths sparked a riot that led to nine arrests and 15 officers being injured after rumours spread on social media that they were being pursued by the police.

Timeline of the crash according to police 17:59.40 CCTV shows the bike travelling towards the police vehicle in Frank Road. The bike then turns around. 18:00.52 The bike is followed by the police vehicle, as seen on CCTV images. Blue lights or sirens were not illuminated. 18:01.18 Police vehicle is at New Ely Church roundabout and travels through Archer Road, Stanway Road and Howell Road. 18:02.31 Police vehicle turns onto Grand Avenue. 18:02.17 - 18:02.41 approximate time of the road traffic collision in Snowden Road. At the time of the collision, the police van is in Grand Avenue, half a mile away from Snowden Road. 18:06.59 The police vehicle is on Cowbridge Road West when it receives information about a road traffic collision, illuminates blue lights and makes its way to the collision scene.

The claims were later denied by Alun Michael, the Police and Crime Commissioner for South Wales.

But CCTV from the area has since emerged showing a marked police van following them less than two minutes before the crash.

The exact circumstances of the teenagers' deaths have not been established, but the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) said it had already carried out house-to-house inquiries.

The IOPC said it had recovered CCTV footage from the Ely area and is reviewing initial accounts from the police officers involved.

It said the investigation was examining the 'nature of the police interaction' with Kyrees and Harvey and the 'appropriateness' of the officers' decisions and actions.

The watchdog is also considering whether the police officers' actions in the van constituted a pursuit, and whether the interaction between the officers and the boys was 'reported appropriately by the officers prior to and following the collision'.

IOPC director David Ford: 'Our thoughts and sympathies remain with the family and friends of Kyrees and Harvey, as well as all those affected by the loss of two young lives in such a close-knit community as Ely.

'Our investigators have been conducting inquiries and securing evidence in the immediate vicinity of where the events took place, speaking to local residents, distributing leaflets and gathering as much relevant information as possible.

'I am truly grateful for the co-operation and assistance we have received from people within the local community.

'We are working hard to establish the exact circumstances of what took place in the period leading up to the collision. I would like to reassure everyone in the community that our work will be thorough, impartial, and independent of the police.'

Earlier today, politicians and community leaders met to discuss the aftermath of Monday's tragedy.

First Minister Mark Drakeford said: 'This week, two families are grieving for their sons and the people of Ely have experienced a collective trauma.

'My thoughts are with the families and friends of Harvey and Kyrees.

'Representatives of the local community and public agencies, including Action in Caerau and Ely, the Welsh Government and Cardiff Council today met in Ely.

'We have agreed to jointly sponsor a grassroots-led initiative to create a community plan for Ely, to respond to the long-term needs of residents. It will be focused on actions and outcomes for people in Ely.'

A friend of the two boys' families said on Wednesday: 'I'm just absolutely devastated and heartbroken for my friends. My heart is hurting. That's the little boy I used to babysit and push around in a pram.

One video shows a police van following an e-bike less than two minutes before the accident that killed the two boys. This image shows the e-bike

A marked police van then follows behind the bike about one second later

'It is so, so sad. They both went to see their boys yesterday and they are both very numb and haven't got much to say at the moment.'

The friend said the original CCTV video of the 'chase', which has circulated on social media, supported claims a police van was following the pair on the day of the incident.

They believed the boys had got away from the police by riding up Stanwey Road, which is blocked off to traffic at one end, and had then ridden on to the adjacent Snowden Road where the crash happened.

South Wales Police are investigating claims of a pursuit but said the collision had already happened when the first officers arrived on the scene.

But the friend said: 'The reason why the police wasn't on the scene is because the boys have gone through a blocked street and the police knew they couldn't go that way so they have turned on v to Grand Avenue, which led the boys to cut through on to Stanway Road on to Snowden Road.

'The police have already stated they were on Grand Avenue and they were not on the scene. They weren't on the scene because they lost them.'

Red and blue flares were set off during the vigil

Several people were in tears as the balloons were released

According to the official police timeline the bike was being followed by the police van, with no blue flashing lights or siren, at 52 seconds past six on Monday evening.

The alleged chase ended at 18:02.31 when the marked police van turned into Grand Avenue.

Kyrees and Harvey were in a collision between 18:02.17 – 18:02.41 and died at the scene in Snowden Road.

The teenagers, from the suburb of Ely, were known for riding the e-bike around the streets despite a clampdown on illegal riding.

Friends described them as 'motorbike heads' who had grown up together on the tough estate in the west of Cardiff and were 'just enjoying themselves' when they died.

Harvey's godmother, Bridy Bool, said Harvey was 'a typical 15-year-old' who 'loved motorbikes, bikes and football' and who had eaten dinner with his mother Nadine just ten minutes before he died.

She insisted the boys had done nothing to spark a police 'chase', adding: 'They were bare-faced innocent children.'

One witness who caught the pair cycling on CCTV said they appeared scared of the vehicle, having 'panicked' and trying to flee after coming across it on the road.

At another vigil on Wednesday, Belinda Sullivan, mother of Kyrees, blasted the South Wales force, telling The Daily Telegraph: 'The police killed my son. I've got nothing else to say.'

A relative of Harvey told The Times: 'If they [police] see someone on a Sur-Ron [an e-bike brand], they think they are a drug dealer.

'The police told Harvey's family that there were no police vehicles in the area, they didn't get chased and there was no sighting of them. But there it is, it's all in the videos.'

One witness whose CCTV captured the moment they were forced to jump out of the way of the bike and the van as they drove past said both were travelling 'at speed'.

They told the newspaper: 'You could see the boys were panicking and trying to get away from them.'

A dozen officers were injured - none seriously - during the riots on Monday night.

Four males, aged 16, 17, 18 and 29 were arrested in Ely on Thursday, and one man aged 21 was arrested in Tremorfa, a suburb on the other side of the city.

They all remain in custody on suspicion of riot.

On the night of the riot and the following day, two 15-year-old boys from Ely and Llanrumney were arrested, as was a 15-year-old girl form Roath and a 16-year-old from Ely.

An activist with a megaphone, wearing a BLM hoodie, urged on his fellow protesters, chanting: 'If Kenosha don't get it, shut it down'.

He then began chanting: 'Seven shots in the back' - a reference to Jacob Blake, a black man who was shot seven times by a white officer in Kenosha on August 23, 2020.

Blake's shooting sparked the Kenosha riots, during which Rittenhouse on August 25, 2020 shot and killed two white BLM demonstrators and injured a third.

The jury in Rittenhouse's case began their deliberations on Monday after an intense two-week trial.

Rittenhouse is charged with first-degree intentional homicide and other counts for killing Joseph Rosenbaum and Anthony Huber and wounding Gaige Grosskreutz.

Ahead of the verdict, the governor of Wisconsin, Tony Evers, ordered 500 members of the National Guard to be put on standby, 60 miles away, in case of unrest.

Many expect there to be fury from the 'losing' side of the argument, regardless of whether the 18-year-old is convicted or acquitted.

'We continue to be in close contact with our partners at the local level to ensure the state provides support and resources to help keep the Kenosha community and greater area safe,' Evers stated.

'The Kenosha community has been strong, resilient, and has come together through incredibly difficult times these past two years, and that healing is still ongoing,' Evers said.

'I urge folks who are otherwise not from the area to please respect the community by reconsidering any plans to travel there and encourage those who might choose to assemble and exercise their First Amendment rights to do so safely and peacefully.'

Kenosha Police Department and the Kenosha County Sheriff's Department said they are monitoring the trial and are working with local and federal authorities to ensure the 'safety of our communities.'

'We recognize that there are varying opinions and feelings that revolve around the trial that may cause concerns,' the two agencies said.

Protesters hold signs outside the Kenosha County Courthouse, Tuesday, Nov. 16, 2021 in Kenosha, Wis., during the Kyle Rittenhouse murder trial. Rittenhouse is accused of killing two people and wounding a third during a protest over police brutality in Kenosha, last year

On Monday and Tuesday the courthouse saw demonstrators calling for Rittenhouse's conviction, and supporters demanding his acquittal.

Protesters carried signs that read, 'Know justice know peace,' 'Self-defense is not a crime,' and 'Racism kills.'

Their chants could be heard inside the courthouse.

Among them were Mark and Patricia McCloskey - the Missouri couple who hit the headlines when they stood outside their St Louis mansion armed with guns as Black Lives Matter protesters passed last summer.

Mark McCloskey is now running for the U.S. Senate, hoping to represent Missouri.

'We feel for Mr. Rittenhouse,' Mark McCloskey told Fox News on Monday. 'We feel he acted in self-defense.

'We think he's been politically prosecuted, as were we, and we're hoping that the jury find him not guilty on all counts and that he can go home a free man.

The McCloskeys were outside the courthouse again on Tuesday.

Residents of Kenosha were braced for unrest.

'No matter which way the verdict goes, somebody is going to be upset,' said Lyna Postuchow, owner of A Summer's Garden, a floral shop.

She told NBC News: 'You always have to be ready because you don't know what's going to happen, but we hope cooler minds prevail.'

Last summer saw her shop smashed during the violent unrest following Blake's shooting, and $10,000 worth of damage was done.

'Nobody wants a repeat of last summer. Those were not Kenosha people. That's not who caused us damage,' Postuchow said.

Gus Harris, owner of Flex & Burn Fitness Center, said he plans to board up his gym like he did in the summer of 2020.

'Obviously, we're concerned. Definitely,' he told NBC.

Some were waiting to see which way the jury went, and how the crowd reacted, before deciding whether to board up their stores.

Mike Lampos, owner of the downtown bar Fec's Place, said: 'Our city is on the line. Either way, you're going to have people who are unhappy. Only half will be happy about the outcome. The other half are the people who are coming,' to possibly damage businesses, he said.

'I wouldn't say I'm not concerned, but I'm not as worried as I was. I'm not boarding up,' he continued. 'Well, if this were to turn into something we had last year and buildings are burning, I've got my boards ready. I could board up in an hour.'

Anne Benson, owner of Oliver's Bakery, agreed.

'Do I have my boards? Yes, I do.

'Do I want to put them up? No, I don't,' she said, speaking to NBC affiliate TJM4.

'I'm not sure what's going to happen. All I'm going to do is stay positive.'

John Fox, a 61-year-old Kenosha resident who lived near the scene of the 2020 protests and previously represented the business district as an alderman, said he was deeply worried.

'I am feeling, oh gosh, I am feeling hopeful that nothing gets out of hand no matter how the verdict comes in,' Fox, who has since retired, told The Daily Beast.

He said last year's unrest was 'three days of destruction and death.'

He added: 'I just hope that people remain calm and don't do any damage and don't hurt each other.'

Jurors deciding the fate of Rittenhouse called time on their deliberations shortly before 6pm on Tuesday, and will resume on Wednesday morning.

The foreman of the jury informed Judge Bruce Schroeder at 5:50pm local time that they were done for the day.

They had arrived at the courthouse at 9am on Tuesday, and Rittenhouse then drew slips of paper out of a raffle drum to determine the six alternates.

The 12 remaining jurors, seven women and five men, deliberated all day, except for a lunch break around noon.

Jurors requested copies of pages one to six of the jury instructions in the morning and then requested copies of the rest of the 36 pages in the afternoon

With the jury quietly tucked away deliberating Rittenhouse's fate, decorum outside the Wisconsin courthouse dissolved into angry protests on Tuesday with the arrival of BLM activists and Second Amendment enthusiasts.

Rittenhouse, now 18, was 17 when he shot dead two white BLM protesters at a riot in Kenosha, Wisconsin, last August, and injured a third.

His lawyers say he was a scared boy acting in self-defense, eager to protect the town as it fell under siege from an angry mob. Prosecutors tried to paint him as a bloodthirsty vigilante and an embodiment of the systemic racism his victims were protesting against.

The jury began discussions on Tuesday morning, after a dramatic two-week trial.

And, as their hushed deliberations began away from public view, protesters descended on the courthouse.

One armed security guard wearing riot gear was among those outside. The guard told DailyMail.com he had been hired by a TV station to provide security for journalists who had been threatened recently.

Five hundred National Guardsmen remain on stand-by near Kenosha, ready to step in if the situation escalates.

'The Kenosha County Sheriff's Department and Kenosha Police Department understand and recognize the anxiety surrounding the Kyle Rittenhouse trial,' the sheriff's office said.

'We have also strengthened our existing relationships with State and Federal resources. At this time, we have no reason to facilitate road closures, enact curfews or ask our communities to modify their daily routines.

'Lastly and most importantly, we have and will continue to be engaged with our community leaders.'

Judge Bruce Schroeder yesterday ruled that it was legal for Rittenhouse to carry the weapon. He threw out the charge, saying the wording of the law is ambiguous and confusing for even the most seasoned professionals like him, let alone for ordinary citizens

The jury has been asked to consider five charges: two counts of murder, one of attempted murder and two counts of recklessly endangering public safety.

On Monday, Judge Bruce Schroeder dismissed a charge of possession of a firearm under 18, citing a loophole that Rittenhouse's legal team successfully argued that says the law makes it legal for people under 18 to carry long-barreled guns.

It was a technicality that stunned the prosecution, which thought the gun charge was their only slam dunk.

Rittenhouse's legal team says he was acting in self-defense and that he was responding to a gunshot he heard behind him when he pulled the trigger.

His mother Wendy has stated publicly that she believes he would be dead if he hadn't pulled his own trigger, and that he was being chased by 'a mob'.

Rittenhouse sobbed on the witness stand and said he was traumatized by the day's events.

White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki weighed in on the case on Monday night, condemning Rittenhouse as a 'vigilante'.

She also refused to explain on Monday why Joe Biden called Kyle Rittenhouse a 'white supremacist' immediately after the 17-year-old shot three white people during riots in Kenosha, Wisconsin last year.

White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki refused to discuss on Monday Joe Biden calling Kyle Rittenhouse a 'white supremacist' last year

'What I'm not going to speak to right now is anything about an ongoing trial nor the president's past comments,' she said, even though the president commented on the situation before it was litigated.

But Psaki then made her feelings clear, saying: 'What I can reiterate for you is the president's view that we shouldn't have, broadly speaking, vigilantes patrolling our communities with assault weapons.

'We shouldn't have opportunists corrupting peaceful protests by rioting and burning down the communities they claim to represent – anywhere in the country.

Two months before Biden was elected president, he criticized then-President Trump for refusing to condemn people who are against the Black Lives Matter riots as 'white supremacists.'

The tweet from the then-candidate included an image of Rittenhouse, who was 17 at the time of the shooting.

'There's no other way to put it: the President of the United States refused to disavow white supremacists on the debate stage last night,' Biden tweeted in September 2020.

Psaki told Fox News' Peter Doocy when talking about the case Monday: 'As you know, closing arguments in this particular case, which I'm not speaking to, I'm just making broad comments about his own view – there's an ongoing trial, we're awaiting a verdict, beyond that, I'm not going to speak to any individual or this case.'

'But the president has spoken to it already,' Doocy shot back.

'I just have nothing more to speak to an ongoing case,' Biden's top spokesperson said.

Republican Rep. Dan Bishop said Tuesday of Biden's comments, 'President Biden should be held accountable for wrongfully labeling a 17-year-old kid a 'white supremacist.' The facts of this case simply never mattered to Biden, this White House, or Congressional Democrats. They want to condemn someone who acted in self-defense against rioters, but seemingly have no problem with the very riots they cheered on last year.'

Addressing the remaining 12 jury members, Judge Bruce Schroeder said Tuesday: 'It is for you to determine whether the defendant is guilty or not guilty.

'You must make a finding on each count [and your] verdict on one count must not affect your finding on any other count.'

Assistant District Attorney Thomas Binger said in closing arguments on Monday that when the shooting stopped, Rittenhouse walked off like a 'hero in a Western.'

But Rittenhouse's lawyer countered that the shooting started after the young man was ambushed by a 'crazy person' that night and feared his gun was going to be wrested away and used to kill him.

The governor of Wisconsin, Tony Evers, has called up 500 members of the Wisconsin National Guard, to counter expected protest.

'We continue to be in close contact with our partners at the local level to ensure the state provides support and resources to help keep the Kenosha community and greater area safe,' Evers stated.

'The Kenosha community has been strong, resilient, and has come together through incredibly difficult times these past two years, and that healing is still ongoing,' Evers said.

'I urge folks who are otherwise not from the area to please respect the community by reconsidering any plans to travel there and encourage those who might choose to assemble and exercise their First Amendment rights to do so safely and peacefully.'

Babbitt, 35, was the only person killed on January 6 when the officer - who hasn't been named - opened fire at a mob of Trump supporters as they stormed through the Rotunda.

The commander of the Capitol Police's Office of Personal Responsibility says 'no further action will be taken in this matter,' according to a memo obtained by NBC News.

In April, the Department of Justice said it wouldn't be filing charges against the officer, so the conclusion of the internal probe ends the official investigation.

Babbitt's family told The Washington Examiner earlier this month that they plan on filing a $10million wrongful death lawsuit, claiming a plainclothes officer didn't issue a verbal command.

Babbitt was the only person killed after protesters stormed the Capitol on January 6

The family's lawyer, Terry Roberts, alluded to a video of the Air Force veteran being shot and said the fact that no one appears to be ducking for cover in the moments before Babbitt was killed also suggests that the cop gave no verbal warning.

The cop's lawyer denied this in previous interviews and said his client issued multiple verbal commands but that they weren't audible on the video because he was wearing a mask.

Babbitt served multiple Middle East tours from 2004 to 2016, according to Air Force records.

Her attorney says she was 'mysteriously removed with little explanation', suggesting the District Superintendent Russell sacked her because she found her social media postings 'offensive, unacceptable, and unprofessional,' and believed Sacks to be 'racist'.

The memes include ones posted to Instagram and Facebook at the height of civil unrest during the summer.

Another accused politicians of being ‘professional looters’ and juxtaposed an image of Congress next to people looting from stores that had been smashed during rioting.

Conspiracy theories were also a common theme with one suggesting that the coronavirus pandemic was a deliberate attempt to have Trump removed from office.

‘If you think the coronavirus panic in an election year right after 3 failed coup attempt against Trump is a coincidence? You might be as dumb as a rock!’

On Thanksgiving, Sacks released a statement where she outlined the reasons for her sudden departure.

'Many of you know that I am no longer the Principal of Evergreen Elementary at this time. However, the circumstances surrounding this situation have been kept quiet until now.

'I am reaching out to you today to share with you that as Principal of Evergreen Elementary School I was terminated because I expressed right of center political views - PRIVATELY. Political memes caused me to lose my job. Nothing that I did was even borderline unacceptable - they were simply political viewpoints.

'I was Principal of one of the best performing elementary schools in Pennsylvania and still fell victim to being cancelled out by liberal bureaucrats who don't believe in diversity of thought, speech, opinion, or political affiliation.

With the support of my husband and family, I have decided to challenge the school district by filing a lawsuit against them to save my job. I hope to lead by example and inspire others to stand against the erosion of our constitutional rights in America.'

No matter their content, however political or controversial, Sacks' lawyers believe that the school board's sacking of her is illegal and is now suing the District claiming she never so much as received a warning.

Perkiomen Valley School District and Superintendent Barbara Russell, pictured, fired principal Amy Sacks because she found her social media postings 'offensive, unacceptable, and unprofessional.'

'At no point was Amy advised to get counsel, nor was she informed of her rights; instead she was viciously threatened with career ruination if she tried to contest anything happening,' Sacks' lawyers contend.

The school board approved her termination but then stated that Sacks had 'resigned'.

'The conduct was wildly illegal. Amy has a near absolute right to free speech on her private Facebook account. Furthermore, before any action can be taken against a public employee, Due Process requires that the school provide her notice of the charges against her,' Sacks' lawyers state.

The lawsuit claims Superintendent Russell told Sacks that her posts had offended a parent who then got in touch with the school district.

Other postings from around the same time showed her clear opposition to having Joe Biden as president.

‘This is a potato’, read one, next to an image of a potato. ‘If this potato was running against Joe Biden, I’d vote for the potato.’

In another posting, Sacks also made light of the situation affecting the U.S. with the virus coupled with civil unrest.

‘Looking for some clarity. Is Corona Season over and we are on to Riot Season? I just need to know if I need a mask or a rifle.’

Politics was also familiar theme of attack.

The wild brawl took place at Pirrama Park in Pyrmont around 9:40pm on Saturday March 6, and involved a group of men and two 16-year-old girls.

Police allege the two groups were arguing before the dispute turned violent, with handheld video of the fight showing the women being repeatedly assaulted.

Police have released footage of a fourth man they believe can assist in their inquiries (pictured), describing him as being of Caucasian appearance and aged in his 20's

One girl is seen being knocked to the floor and kicked in the face, while another is thrown over a concrete ledge by the hair before being stamped on the head.

Officers from Sydney City Police Command, with assistance from the Public Order and Riot Squad attended the scene and arrested three men aged 29, 23 and 21.

Police have now released vision of a fourth man they believe can assist with their inquiries.

The man is described as being of Caucasian appearance, aged in his 20's, and was wearing a grey hoodie, dark pants and blue sneakers.

Police allege the two groups had been arguing before the dispute spilled over into violence

Three men were charged over the alleged assault after they were taken to Day Street Police Station.

The older two men - aged 29 and 23 - were charged with affray and two counts of common assault while the 21-year-old was charged with affray and common assault.

All three men have been refused bail and remain before the courts.

The brawl came as Mardi Gras celebrations wound down following a Covid-safe parade at the Sydney Cricket Ground.

Liz Cheney on Wednesday backed Speaker Nancy Pelosi's decision to reject two GOP members to the committee investigating the January 6th riot on Capitol Hill.

'I agree with what the Speaker has done,' she told reporters on Capitol Hill. Pelosi appointed Cheney to the panel last month.

Cheney also criticized McCarthy, saying he should not be speaker if Republicans win control of the House in next year's midterm election, arguing he wasn't qualified to be third in line for the presidency.

'Any person who would be third in line to the presidency must demonstrate a commitment to the constitution and a commitment to the rule of law, and Minority Leader McCarthy has not done that,' she said.

'The rhetoric we have heard from the minority leader is disingenuous,' she said. 'At every opportunity, the minority leader has attempted to prevent the American people from understanding what happened.'

'I am absolutely confident that we will have a nonpartisan investigation,' she added.

Republican Rep. Liz Cheney backed Speaker Nancy Pelosi (left) and criticized House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy (right) as not fit to serve as third in line for the presidency should Republicans win back the House in the 2022 midterms

Cheney was removed from House leadership after she criticized Donald Trump for his role in encouraging the January 6th MAGA rioters. She was one of 10 House Republicans who voted for his second impeachment.

Trump has attacked her repeatedly and is encouraging a primary challenge to her in her Wyoming House seat.

Pelosi on Wednesday barred Republican Congressmen Jim Banks and Jim Jordan, both strong allies of Trump, from serving on The House Select Committee to Investigate the January 6th Attack on the U.S. Capitol.

Both men voted to challenge certification of President Joe Biden's election victory and have promoted the 'big lie' - the false argument that Trump actually won in 2020 and was the victim of election fraud.

Pelosi named Cheney as one of her picks to the panel allowing her to tout it as bipartisan even as Republicans objected to its creation.

McCarthy, meanwhile, reacted with fury and pulled all five of his nominees to the special committee investigating the January 6th MAGA riot after Pelosi rejected Banks and Jordan.

McCarthy charged Pelosi with 'playing politics' and creating a 'sham process' with her decision.

Pelosi said in a statement she made her decision based on the 'integrity' of the investigation. As speaker, Pelosi has final say on who sits on the panel.

'With respect for the integrity of the investigation, with an insistence on the truth and with concern about statements made and actions taken by these Members, I must reject the recommendations of Representatives Banks and Jordan to the Select Committee,' Pelosi said in a statement.

'The unprecedented nature of January 6th demands this unprecedented decision,' she added.

McCarthy slammed Pelosi for her decision.

'Why are you allowing a lame duck speaker to destroy this institution? This is the people's house. Not Pelosi's house,' he said in a hastily arranged press conference on Capitol Hill.

Pelosi is not a lame duck speaker. Republicans would have to win a majority in the 2022 election for that to happen.

McCarthy vowed to hold his own investigation that he said would include a look at Trump's role in the January 6th riot, where the former president's supporters stormed the Capitol to interrupt the certification of Biden's presidential victory.

'This represents an egregious abuse of power and will irreparably damage this institution,' McCarthy said in a statement blasting Pelosi's move, saying it showed 'this panel has lost all legitimacy and credibility and shows the Speaker is more interested in playing politics than seeking the truth.'

The House Select Committee to Investigate the January 6th Attack on the U.S. Capitol's investigation was expected to be highly contentious. The panel will hold its will hold its first hearing in six days, on Tuesday, July 27.

Democrats pushed for the creation of a 9/11-style commission to investigate January 6, but that was tanked by Republicans; Instead the House formed a 1/6 select committee to probe the Capitol riot (pictured)

But Pelosi's rejection of two of the other party's picks is unprecedented. Leaders of the respective parties usually respect each other's decisions.

'We need a comprehensive investigation as to who organized this attack, who paid for it, how they nearly succeeded in overthrowing a presidential election, why they did it and how we must organize ourselves to prevent anything like it from ever happening again,' she said in her statement.

The White House supported Pelosi's move.

'The President has made clear that the shameful events of January 6th deserve a full, independent, and transparent investigation to ensure something like that never happens again, and he has full confidence in the Speaker's ability to lead that work,' Biden spokesman Michael Gwin said in a statement.

Republicans opposed Pelosi's original call for a 9/11-style bipartisan commission. McCarthy opposed it in the House where it passed with Democratic support. But the bill died in the Senate once Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell announced he would not support it.

https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/12/sri-lanka-president-to-name-new-pm-as-unrest-simmers-amid-economic-crisis,1,"Beleaguered president Gotabaya Rajapaksa was set to name a new prime minister on Thursday to try to steer Sri Lanka out of its dire economic crisis after days of violence, officials said.

Respected five-time former premier Ranil Wickremesinghe was the frontrunner to head a “unity government” with cross-party support in the 225-member parliament and replace Rajapaksa’s elder brother Mahinda who stepped down on Monday.

“A swearing-in is likely today unless there is a last-minute hiccup,” a senior official close to the president told AFP.

In a televised address to the nation on Wednesday night, Rajapaksa stopped short of yielding to weeks of nationwide protests calling for him to resign.

The country of 22 million people is in its worst economic crisis since independence with severe shortages of food, fuel and medicines and long power cuts.

But in a bid to win over the opposition who wanted Rajapaksa to quit, the 72-year-old pledged to give up most of his executive powers and set up a new cabinet this week.

“I will name a prime minister who will command a majority in parliament and the confidence of the people,” Rajapaksa said in the televised speech. Rajapaksa said he will also take steps to abolish the country’s powerful executive presidential system.

Mahinda Rajapaksa resigned as prime minister after his supporters attacked anti-government supporters and ran riot in Colombo.

This unleashed several days of violence that killed at least nine people and injured more than 200, with dozens of Rajapaksa loyalist homes set on fire.

Security forces patrolling in armoured personnel carriers with orders to shoot on sight anyone engaged in looting or violence have since cracked down on public disorder.

A curfew was lifted Thursday morning only to be reimposed after a six-hour break allowing people to stock up on essentials.

The main opposition SJB party was initially invited to lead a new government, but its leader Sajith Premadasa insisted that the president first step down.

However, about a dozen MPs from the SJB pledged support to Wickremesinghe, 73, who has been prime minister five times since 1993 and is seen as a pro-West free-market reformist.

Wickremesinghe is the only legislator from his United National Party (UNP) which was routed at the August 2020 election that gave Rajapaksa a two-thirds majority.

With the economic crisis, the Rajapaksa government began to unravel with mass defections to the opposition, but since April no group in the 225-member assembly enjoys an absolute majority.

About 80 protestors were marching along NE Martin Luther King Jr. Blvd when individuals starting to break the windows of businesses.

The windows from a bank, a real estate agency, a phone store, a hotel and a Starbucks were all shattered.

As soon as word spread on Twitter, Portland police declared the area to be a riot zone and told those present to immediately leave.

The police say that some people threw projectiles at officers and 'pepper sprayed community members.'

Around 100 people had joined the protest at its peak, but it didn't take long before things appeared under control with the riot declaration rescinded by 8:27pm.

Many people sprinted away from officers staged on Seventh Avenue.

'The rioters in the Lloyd District have been dispersed by officers.' Law enforcement will still monitor the area 'for any further illegal activity.'

Tensions have been stoked after a black man shot and killed by law enforcement in a small city near Portland, Oregon, in southwestern Washington state.

Kevin E. Peterson Jr, a 21-year-old father, was fatally gunned down in a US Bank parking lot in Vancouver, Washington on Thursday.

Hundreds of people gathered for a vigil Friday evening which also turned into a protest, with some holding signs reading, 'Honk for Black lives. White silence is violence' and 'Scream his name.'

Nearby, tensions flared between left- and right-wing protesters. Video recorded by journalists in a parking lot showed two groups of people shouting at each other. Also, some armed demonstrators gathered near a building they told reporters they were protecting.

The crowds ultimately fizzled out near the vigil but a group of hundreds of protesters later marched through downtown Vancouver.

Authorities declared an unlawful assembly and ordered protesters to disperse. At least one person appeared to have been detained, according to video posted online by a journalist.

Family and friends had described Peterson as a former high school football player and the proud father of an infant daughter.

Mourners pause to remember Kevin Peterson Jr., a 21-year-old Black man who was fatally shot by law enforcement Thursday, as he is honored with a candlelight vigil at the Hazel Dell branch of U.S. Bank in Vancouver, Washington state

In a statement, Clark County Sheriff Chuck Atkins said a joint city-county narcotics task force was conducting an investigation just before 6 p.m. Thursday and chased a man into the parking lot of a bank, where he fired a gun at them. A firearm was recovered at the scene, Atkins said.

Investigators said Friday evening that the narcotics task force had contacted a man suspected of selling illegal drugs in a motel parking lot and that he fled on foot with officers following. The man produced a handgun and the officers backed off, investigators said. A short time later, the man encountered three Clark County deputies, all of whom fired their pistols at the man, they added. They did not say the man fired a handgun found at the scene, making it unclear what happened just before the shooting.

The community is a short drive north across the Columbia River from Portland, where racial justice protests have played out nearly every night since George Floyd´s killing by police in May. Southwest Washington is also home to the right-wing group Patriot Prayer, which has held rallies for President Donald Trump in Portland in recent months that ended in violence.

'There was a ton of grief, a ton of grief. He´s 21 and has a baby, an infant,' Smiff said. 'They´re not sure what happened, why the encounter took place. Everyone was extremely disheveled and confused.'

Jake Thompson, a high school acquaintance of Peterson, said he took photos at the wedding of Peterson´s parents in Portland in 2018. On Friday, he posted a black-and-white photo of Peterson in a suit and bow tie as he flashed a big grin.

'I didn´t sleep much last night,' he said Friday.

https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-9125099/Tucker-Carlson-turns-Trump-blames-president-U-S-Capitol-riot.html,1,"Fox News' Tucker Carlson on Thursday night called out President Donald Trump after he 'recklessly encouraged' his supporters to invade the U.S. Capitol on Wednesday sparking violence that has resulted in five fatalities.

Carlson, a Trump ally who has spent the majority of his presidential term praising and protecting him, claimed that the president has now reached the end of his 'shelf life' and it was 'not healthy' for the nation to continue being 'focused on a single man'.

The Fox host added that Trump has now reached his 'expiration date' and questioned whether the president is 'worth all of this time and attention'.

However, Carlson did continue to defend the actions of Trump's loyalists, despite Wednesday's violent scenes, as he blasted the Republican party for not caring about the president's base and taunted them for having spent too long defending the 'personal reputations of its leaders'.

He claimed that the storming of the Capitol yesterday was simply a 'political protest' that 'got out of hand'.

His comments came as the Wall Street Journal, which like Fox is owned by Rupert Murdoch, called on Trump to resign before he is impeached in an abrupt about-turn from the paper.

Carlson has continued to defend President Trump in the past few weeks even as his chances of overturning the election became less and less likely and no evidence of widespread fraud was unearthed.

Yet, he appeared to jump ship on Thursday night, while saying he still supported the president's base in claiming that the Democrats were using Wednesday's events as a 'pretext for an unprecedented crackdown on civil liberties'.

'Just in the last several hours we have heard people in positions of power and authority demand that those who support Donald Trump should no longer be allowed to publish books or use the internet or fly on airplanes,' he fumed.

'What happened yesterday, they're telling us, wasn't simply that a political protest got out of hand after the president recklessly encouraged it, that is in fact what happened,' Carlson continued, admitting the president was to blame.

He said that the effect on Trump's presidency on the country 'has been noticeable'.

'We've gone from being this big continental country with an enormous span of concerns and interests to a sweaty chat room of 300 million people all of whom are focused on a single man, Donald Trump. That is not healthy no matter how you feel about Trump,' Carlson said.

'At some point you've got to wonder about where our country is putting all of its energy. Is any single president, anyone worth all of this time and attention? All politicians whether you agree with them or not come with a shelf life, they are people.

'They don't last forever, none of us do. In Trump's case, the expiration date arrives in 13 days and after that he will not be president.'

Carlson still defended the hundreds of Trump loyalists who broke into the Capitol

The Fox host also claimed that the group was not racist. Pictured above, a supporter in the US Capitol Rotunda on Wednesday afternoon holding a Confederate flag

Carlson then claimed that he was not attacking Trump but criticized his actions in encouraging supporters to go to the U.S. Capitol building in his speech at the 'Stop the Steal Rally' on Wednesday morning, an action which the TV personality called 'wrong'.

'It was a political protest that got completely out of control, as we said before, because the president recklessly encouraged it and that is wrong,' he continued.

During the opening segment of his show, Carlson also launched into a tirade against the Republican party and claimed that they don't care about their voters or the American people.

'Donald Trump thinks exclusively about Donald Trump but so does almost every single Democrat in congress as well as every single Republican. All of them is Trump obsessed,' raged Carlson.

'Who's got your concerns top of mind? Who wakes up in the middle of the night about your family?' he asked.

'That's the main thing we need to change. It won't be easy, but the themes are pretty clear and here are the basics. The point of the Republican party is not to protect the personal reputations of its leaders. That cannot be the priority.

'The point of the Republican party is to protect its voters. In practice that needs protecting the bill of rights, the most basic freedoms and bedrock promises of American life - without them you wouldn't want to live here.'

He continued to state that the party could also not rely on one person as he encouraged his viewers to give up on the hope of Trump and claimed that 'freedoms are more important than any single politician'.

Carlson accused the Republican party of not supporting Trump's base. Pictured, a supporter of President Donald Trump chants outside the Senate Gallery inside the Capitol

'Donald Trump could become immortal and win the next 40 presidential elections and his daughter the next 40 after that but if America becomes a place where you have to violate your own conscience in order to hold a job, we are not allowed to protect your family from mob violence, where your children can't afford to get married and raise your grandchildren because employers don't like their skin color, then what's the point of all of this?' Carlson questioned.

'There is no point. No one wants to live in a place like that or should have to no matter who the president is. We should be very concerned about all of this right now; these are the core concerns,' he continued.

'Thirteen days from now, these voters will not have Donald Trump to protect them, they won't have anyone unless the Republican party decides to wake up and push back against the lies and progress and acknowledge the purpose of those lies which is an unprecedented crackdown on the way you live.

'You will have no chance either,' he concluded.

Carlson also took issue with the Democratic reaction to yesterday's events and claimed that the left is wrong for branding the actions of Trump supporters as racist and terrorism.

'CNN describes it as an insurrection, Chuck Schumer likened it to Pearl Harbor, it was our generation's 9/11 and, needless to say, it was 'white supremacy',' he said.

'They understand how to use language, not simply to describe what is happening, they use it to political ends. It wasn't an insurrection, stop with the lying.'

While Carlson has remained a staunch Trump defender throughout most of his presidency, the Fox host has been criticized by some viewers for some instances of pushback to Trump's actions over the past year.

On June 2, Carlson had called on the president to do more as violence erupted in the early days of the protests over George Floyd's deaths, and stated that he would not be reelected if he did not prove that he could protect the American people.

Just two weeks later, Carlson criticized the president again for not taking action to bring down the CHAZ occupied zone in Seattle after Trump said he was enjoying sitting back and watching the crime spree that erupted there.

After the election, Carlson faced high levels of backlash from Trump's supporters after he called out the president's attorney Sidney Powell for pushing conspiracy theories, with some viewers claiming they were abandoning Fox News as a result.

Another Trump ally at Fox, Sean Hannity, also acknowledged that Joe Biden would now become president in two weeks' time as he questioned Thursday how the breach of the Capitol had happened and why law enforcement was not more prepared for the thousands who arrived to the rally.

'As is the president’s signature style, he fought as hard as he possibly could after the actions of Congress last night,' Hannity said at the start of his show on Thursday.

'Pretty much any remedy [Trump] had and what he has been fighting for have been exhausted.

'It’s the president’s right to do it.'

But Hannity later added: 'Law and order must always prevail, calm must be restored. We must get on with the business of America. All true.'

Hannity called for 'fixing flaws in our election process' before predicting that the 'media mob' would get 'bored' of Biden and 'miss' Trump.

‘My attitude is you broke it, you own it, and guess what? We know you helped somebody that everybody knew was physically weak and frail, clearly struggling cognitively who also has the most radically stated socialist agenda in the history of this country,' Hannity said.

The top Trump ally declined to blame the president for the Capitol riot, saying that it was a security breach and that those who illegally entered the building should be prosecuted.

'Americans demand answers, rightly so,' Hannity said.

'What we all witnessed yesterday inside the Capitol building, that could never, ever, ever happen again in this country. That building belongs to we the people.

‘This is our house and it was breached, and it was breached within minutes with relative ease ... it's inexplicable.’

Hannity criticized the Capitol Police, saying: ‘They knew that hundreds of thousands of Americans had, in fact, descended upon Washington yesterday.

'They knew what their plan was, to march from the Washington Monument to the Capitol.

'They knew Congress would be in session.'

Hannity also defended the Trump supporters who did not take part in the storming of the Capitol, saying that '99 per cent' of them were law-abiding.

On Thursday night, a Capitol police officer became the fifth fatality of Wednesday's riots as Trump acknowledged that the election was lost and pleaded for calm.

'Take responsibility and go away quietly': Wall Street Journal editorial board calls on Donald Trump to RESIGN

The Wall Street Journal editorial board has called on Donald Trump to resign, in an abrupt severance of their previously accommodating position.

The paper, owned by Rupert Murdoch, has been more tolerant of the president than some of their rivals.

But on Thursday night they knifed him, telling him he needed to leave before he was impeached.

'If Mr. Trump wants to avoid a second impeachment, his best path would be to take personal responsibility and resign,' they wrote.

'This would be the cleanest solution since it would immediately turn presidential duties over to Mr. Pence.

The WSJ editorial board on Thursday night published a damning indictment of Trump's actions

'And it would give Mr. Trump agency, a la Richard Nixon, over his own fate.'

'It is best for everyone, himself included, if he goes away quietly,' the paper's team wrote.

Murdoch-owned press - Fox News, The Wall Street Journal and New York Post, among them - was initially supportive of the president, but have grown increasingly tired of his antics.

Fox News was the first to call Arizona for Joe Biden - a move which so enraged Trump he forced his son-in-law Jared Kushner to phone Murdoch directly and demand a retraction. Murdoch refused, and since then Trump has been urging his supporters to abandon Fox News and switch the the fringe stations Newsmax and OAN.

Stay safe and dry out there. Here were today’s major developments: Sydney is bracing for heavy rain to drench the city over the coming days, potentially causing flash flooding, flooded rivers and the spillover of the Warragamba Dam. Rain is forecast to likely begin tonight in Sydney and become heavy on Friday before easing on Saturday.

A man has died after his vehicle was found in flood waters on the outskirts of Brisbane this morning. Queensland police were called to conduct a welfare check of a vehicle submerged in flood waters at a private property on Begley Road in Greenbank.

The Northern Territory’s Don Dale youth detention centre remains in indefinite lockdown after a group of inmates set fire to the education centre and climbed the roof as part of a riot.

Private and rental electric scooters will become a permanent fixture on Melbourne streets as Victoria puts the finishing touches on safety regulations.

And the National Anti-Corruption Commission (Nacc) says it’s conducting 15 corruption investigations and will soon publish a final report of one of its recently completed probes. The commission’s latest figures, released on Thursday, show the federal integrity body received 2,747 referrals of potential corruption in the nine months since it opened its doors.

All eyes are on the Warragamba Dam and its possible spilling in New South Wales, with forecasts predicting rain of up to 200mm into the weekend. The atmosphere over the Sydney/Illawarra regions will be saturated from the ground up to an elevation of ~12km on Friday night.

4 Apr 2024 07.12 BST A taxi booking app was already facing challenges as UberX brought rideshare to Australia with an intent to “crush” the competition, a civil trial has been told. Taxi Apps, the company behind the app GoCatch, is suing Uber in the Supreme Court of Victoria over claims it knowingly launched UberX illegally in Australia with the intention of injuring GoCatch. Lawyers for GoCatch have claimed “tech bros” at the ride-share giant said they wanted to crush and destroy the business, suggesting they targeted Taxi Apps, but Uber on Thursday argued the language simply equated to “out-compete”. Uber’s barrister John Sheahan told the court: It’s just the language of the business ... it’s the way they hype each other up. ‘Crushing’ GoCatch is beating them. Its out-competing them at their own game. Sheahan suggested GoCatch was to blame for its financial failings, with business plans to mandate in-app payments long-delayed and evidence some taxi drivers were ‘gaming’ the app. Lawyers for Taxi Apps have conceded in court GoCatch had some management issues. But they maintain Uber tried to evade authorities’ attempts to stop their illegal conduct, hacked GoCatch’s computer systems and used spyware to scrape its data. -AAP. Share

4 Apr 2024 06.57 BST The North Australian Aboriginal Justice Agency (NAAJA) has renewed calls for the closure of the notorious Don Dale Youth Detention Centre following the latest riot at the facility and associated lockdown. The agency urged the NT Government to immediately investigate alternative accommodation options for children currently detained in the Darwin facility, of which it alleged approximately half were being held on remand having not been sentenced for any crimes. Its principal legal officer, Jared Sharp, said the events were a “direct result of the appalling conditions within Don Dale”. On any given night, there are approximately 40 mostly Aboriginal young people detained inside Don Dale with little access to the support they need to address the complex array of factors that have contributed to them being there in the first place. Sharp said Don Dale should have been closed on the recommendation of the Royal Commission more than six years ago, with recent redevelopment of youth detention facilities in Alice Springs providing a potential template for improved care. The Northern Territory spends more on youth detention than any other state or territory and the only way to stop this is by investing in solutions that do work – drug and alcohol counselling, behaviour change programs, adequate healthcare, stable housing, education, training, and employment.

4 Apr 2024 06.36 BST Anne Aly: ‘This is not war. War has rules’ Aly goes on: I do want to make a really important point about war. This is not war. War has rules – rules that have been agreed upon by the international community. War has principles, and war has standards of behaviour that are expected of those who are acting in the war. Israel has been … strongly urged by the international community and by the ICJ to abide by those rules of war. Now, the systemic destruction of an entire people, the deliberate withholding of food and aid to an entire people are not acts of war. These are not things that just happen in war, and I think that if the Israeli government wants to continue to utilise war as a context for its actions, then it needs to start abiding by the expected principles of war and the agreed rules of warfare.

4 Apr 2024 06.33 BST Anne Aly criticises Simon Birmingham for repeating Israeli PM's ‘dismissive’ response to aid worker’s death The Labor frontbencher Anne Aly followed Birmingham on ABC’s Afternoon Briefing, appearing alongside Barnaby Joyce. Asked for her comments on the death of Australian aid worker Zomi Frankcom, a clear split in rhetoric of the two major parties continues. Aly expressed her condolences to Frankcom’s family and friends – and her “outrage” at Israel’s response. The dismissive way in which the prime minister of Israel has said this happens in war, and quite frankly the way in which Simon Birmingham has repeated that dismissive claim is offensive. It is offensive to Zomi, her family, to the aid workers, the journalists, the medics who have been killed by Israeli forces, and it is offensive to the 30,000 Palestinians that have been cowed and starved by the actions of Israel. I think that the world is watching very closely, and foreign minister Penny Wong has said, in very clear terms, that Israel needs to change its course, and that it needs to be held accountable, and that it is losing very quickly any kind of support that it has.

4 Apr 2024 06.27 BST ‘This is a war situation and tragedies are occurring all the time’: Birmingham The shadow foreign minister, Simon Birmingham, appeared on the ABC’s Afternoon Briefing earlier while on a visit to New Zealand with Peter Dutton. Asked whether the deaths of the aid workers in Gaza could be “even partly explained as typical things that happen in war”, Birmingham said the killings were “very tragic events” that “should not have occurred”. It entirely appropriate that Israel be expected to have a full investigation of them and to be completely transparent about the outcomes of the investigation … any further steps should be taken based on the outcomes of those investigation. Birmingham said while “tragedies” and “mistakes” do happen in war, it was important for Israel’s prime minister to understand the “deep, deep concern and distress felt in Australia”. These tragedies are just part of what has been an enduring tragedy since the barbaric attacks from Hamas on October 7 and the way in which Hamas has used the citizens and people in Gaza as human shields. This is a war situation and tragedies are occurring all the time. Unfortunately this has now involved an Australian citizen. Share Updated at 06.56 BST

4 Apr 2024 05.59 BST Don Dale detention centre in indefinite lockdown after riot and fire The Northern Territory’s Don Dale youth detention centre remains in indefinite lockdown after a group of inmates set fire to the education centre and climbed the roof as part of a riot. Police were called to the centre on Wednesday afternoon after reports of smoke billowing from the education facility and 14 children on the roof of the building. Territory Families chief executive Emma White said the centre would remain in indefinite lockdown until a department investigation was complete. The NT chief minister Eva Lawler labelled the children “some of the worst-behaved children in the NT”, with charges expected to be laid. There are a number of young people who have displayed abhorrent behaviour. There will be actions that flow from that. Graphic footage was shown on ABC TV in 2016 of four detainees being tear-gassed at the facility, leading to the 2017 royal commission into the protection and detention of children. The NT government accepted in full or in principle all recommendations, including the closure of Don Dale. Five years later, the facility remains open and critics say the government is dragging its feet. Lawler said she remains committed to closing the facility. – with AAP Share Updated at 06.30 BST

4 Apr 2024 05.19 BST Electric scooters 'here to stay' in Melbourne Private and rental electric scooters will become a permanent fixture on Melbourne streets as Victoria puts the finishing touches on safety regulations. E-scooters were allowed in Ballarat from December 2021 and parts of Melbourne from February 2022 as part of a trial, with users since taking more than eight million trips. The trial will be extended for another six months before permanent regulatory settings are introduced in early October. The Victorian Labor government said it would use the time to investigate extra safety measures and rollout a refreshed education campaign across trial areas. Public transport minister Gabrielle Williams said e-scooters were “here to stay”. They’ve proven popular among commuters, especially shift workers, providing an additional option to travel home safely. We have more work to do on safety and compliance to ensure that e-scooters are safe when they’re made permanent later this year. In December, the Australian Medical Association called for stricter rules after a study by the Royal Melbourne Hospital showed 247 riders and nine pedestrians were treated for injuries in 2023.

https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jul/20/uk-risks-chinas-wrath-by-suspending-hong-kong-extradition-treaty?CMP=Share_AndroidApp_rif_is_fun,1,"Conservative MPs and Labour are calling for the wholesale overhaul of relations with China after the government suspended extradition with Hong Kong and banned the export of riot control equipment following Beijing’s imposition of a sweeping national security law on the territory.

Announcing the measures to the Commons, Dominic Raab, the foreign secretary, stressed the desire for continued cooperation with China, but said the actions were “a reasonable and proportionate response” to the law, which effectively criminalises most political dissent.

The move, a week after the British government stripped the Chinese telecoms firm Huawei of any future role in the UK’s 5G network, seems certain to further enrage Beijing.

Speaking before Raab’s announcement, China’s foreign ministry said it would be a mistake to suspend the extradition treaty and urged the UK “to take no more steps down the wrong path”.

While Raab’s decisions were welcomed by both Labour and Conservative MPs, the foreign secretary faced calls to take more robust action, particularly over the mass repression of the Uighur population in China’s Xinjiang province which rights groups warn amounts to cultural genocide.

A series of Tories who had long called for action over Huawei said the government must begin what Tobias Ellwood, a former Foreign Office and defence minister, called “a strategic overhaul of our foreign policy in relation to China”.

“For decades we’ve turned a blind eye to China’s democratic deficit and human rights violations, in the hope that it would mature into a global, responsible citizen,” he told Raab. “That clearly hasn’t happened. Is this now the turning point where we drop the pretence that China shares our values?”

In his statement, Raab said he was particularly worried about sections of the national security law that allowed mainland Chinese authorities to take control of cases and target actions outside of Hong Kong.

Saying this was a serious violation of the agreement that set out Hong Kong’s semi-autonomous status after the handover to China in 1997, Raab said extradition would be stopped unless Beijing gave “clear and robust safeguards” about how the law would be used. The UK does not have an extradition agreement with mainland China.

The UK is also extending to Hong Kong an arms embargo that has covered mainland China since the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre, including a bar on equipment that could be used for crowd control, such as shackles and smoke grenades.

Raab said: “We want to work with China. There is enormous scope for positive, constructive, engagement. But, as we strive for that positive relationship, we are also clear-sighted about the challenges that lie ahead.”

Britain has already promised that up to 3 million Hong Kong residents will be offered the chance to settle in the UK and a path to permanent citizenship.Lisa Nandy, the shadow foreign secretary, said she supported the measures, but called for action in areas such as Chinese investment in UK nuclear power stations, and a more generous approach in allowing entry to Hong Kong nationals, particularly younger people who were less likely to hold British National (Overseas) passports.

“This must mark the start of a more strategic approach to China based on an ethical approach to foreign policy, and an end to the naivety of the golden era years,” she said, referring to the close links forged under David Cameron. “And if it does, he can be assured he will have our full support on this side of the house.”

Tom Tugendhat, the Conservative MP who chairs the Commons foreign affairs committee and has been a leading advocate for tougher action against China, told Raab he welcomed the statement, but added: “Given his time before even entering here as a human rights lawyer, can I just ask why he hasn’t yet made an announcement on the abuse of the Uighur Muslim population in western China?”

Bob Seely, the Tory MP who was a leading critic of Huawei’s role in the UK, told Raab he welcomed the actions over Hong Kong, but said: “The signal truth is the China we hoped for is not the China we are getting.” He added that a “much more significant reset in our relations” was needed.

The government is expected to face continued pressure over the issue, particularly with decisions looming over Chinese involvement in nuclear reactors at Bradwell in Essex and Sizewell in Suffolk.

As well as Hong Kong, there has been an upsurge in condemnation of Chinese actions in Xinjiang, where there is evidence of the use of mass internment camps, and there are claims Uighur women are undergoing forced sterilisation to reduce their population.

Speaking during a visit to a school on Monday, Boris Johnson said such issues were deeply worrying but that he was “not going to be pushed into a position of becoming a knee-jerk sinophobe on every issue”.

The president of the Board of Deputies of British Jews has written to China’s ambassador to the UK, Liu Xiaoming, citing “similarities” between Chinese treatment of Uighurs and Nazi atrocities.

Marie van der Zyl wrote: “Nobody could ... fail to notice the similarities between what is alleged to be happening in China today and what happened in Nazi Germany 75 years ago. ... The world will neither forgive nor forget a genocide against the Uighur people.”

Trump, battling the mid-morning heat in his signature MAGA hat and white polo shirt, teed-off at the pro-amateur event where he will be joined later by his son Eric, Caitlin Jenner, Charles Barkley and pro golfers Bryson DeChambeau and Dustin Johnson.

He was spotted shaking hands with Yasir Al Rumayyan, Prince Mohammed bin Salman's personal banker and the chairman of Newcastle United, on the course.

Defending the series, Trump, 76, told reporters: 'I’ve known these people for a long time in Saudi Arabia and they have been friends of mine.

'They own big percentages of many, many American companies and frankly, what they are doing for golf is so great, what they are doing for the players is so great. The salaries are going to go way up.

'The PGA was not loved by a lot of the players, for a long time. Now they have an alternative and nobody ever would have known it was going to be a gold rush, like this.'

As for 9/11, he said: 'Nobody’s gotten to the bottom of 9/11, unfortunately. And they should have. As to the maniacs that did that horrible thing to our city, to our country, to the world, so nobody’s really been there.'

Later, as he headed off the first tee, Trump even hinted that he would run for the White House once more.

‘You’re going to be so happy. We’ll let you know pretty soon,' he said before asking where the reporter was from. 'They just did a story on me, beautiful,' he said. ‘The first one in five years. Front page, tell them I appreciate it.'

Among the most appalled are the families of 9/11 victims who are horrified that the event is not only welcome in America, but just 50 miles from Ground Zero.

There is also outrage on behalf of murdered Saudi Arabian journalist Jamal Khashoggi, who was killed in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul in 2018.

But Trump - who was dumped by the PGA in 2021 after the Capitol riot - is shrugging off the scandal in exchange for what is unquestionably a handsome payout. He has not disclosed how much LIV is paying for use of Bedminster this weekend.

The families of 9/11 victims vowed to protest outside the club this weekend after being left disappointed by Trump's attempt to make peace.

He had one of his aides contact the group to claim they were 'near and dear' to him. Brett Eagelson, the founder of 9/11 Justice, said the peace offering was of 'little value'

'We’re going to make it as painful as possible and unenjoyable as possible for those involved. We think that they need to know our feelings.

'I think it sets a precedent that money will erase wrongdoing, that’s what angers me the most,' said Matthew Bocchi, who was nine when his father was killed in the attacks.

Donald and Melania Trump last night stepped out to a backdrop of this mounting fury to welcome golfers and event organizers at a Manhattan party.

Earlier this year the PGA moved to ban players who participate in LIV events and this month the Department of Justice opened an investigation into the PGA for anticompetitive behavior.

The tour, backed by Saudi Arabia, has angered family members of 9/11 victims, who are horrified at the former president so publicly supporting the country which in-part funded the attacks.

The terror mastermind, Osama bin Laden, was from a prominent Saudi family before setting up training camps in Afghanistan.

'For Donald Trump, a former president of the United States to host the Saudi golf tournament, help it get off the ground 45 miles or 50 miles from Ground Zero, where 750 New Jerseyans were killed on that day, it is beyond comprehension,' said Dennis McGinley, whose brother Daniel McGinley died in the attacks while working on the 89th floor of the South Tower.

He told DailyMail.com: 'As 9/11 families we've had to grow thick skins over the last 21 years, but this really hurts.

'This one is really painful.'

Their group 9/11 Justice wrote a letter to the former president expressing their 'deep pain and anger' about the tournament.

'The evidence, Mr. Trump, is more clear than ever.

The Saudi nation is largely responsible for the death of our loved ones and for this horrific attack on America. And you know it,' the letter read.

The letter continued: 'It is incomprehensible to us, Mr. Trump, that a former president of the United States would cast our loved ones aside for personal financial gain.

'We hope you will reconsider your business relationship with the Saudi Golf League and will agree to meet with us.'

In a statement earlier this week, the National Press Club said: 'We are revolted by the way the Saudi-funded LIV enterprise has followed the fist bump in the desert by shoving themselves onto golf courses and television screens.

'We call on all Americans to see this unsavory attempt to minimize the grisly bone-saw attack on Washington Post opinion writer Jamal Khashoggi for what it is – an attempt to sweep under the rug a brutal state-sponsored murder.

'We call on people of conscience to reject this tournament. Do not attend. Do not watch it on television. Let it fail.

'That the tournament is being held at a course owned by former President Trump is, if possible, even more revolting.

'It reminds us that the former President bragged of distracting Congress from the murder, delaying the release of the final U.S. government report that concluded MBS, the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia (and recipient of the fist-bump from President Biden) was most likely involved in planning and approving Jamal’s murder.

'And the tournament on the Trump course reminds us how Saudi Arabia finds ways to personally enrich Trump and his family – including $2 billion to his son in law.'

Trump has however remained defiant, insisting that the LIV tournament is the future and that it will inevitably merge with the PGA or surpass it.

'All of those golfers that remain 'loyal' to the very disloyal PGA, in all of its different forms, will pay a big price when the inevitable MERGER with LIV comes, and you get nothing but a big 'thank you' from PGA officials who are making Millions of Dollars a year,' Trump wrote on his social media platform Truth Social on Monday morning.

'If you don't take the money now, you will get nothing after the merger takes place, and only say how smart the original signees were.

'Good luck to all, and congratulations to really talented Cam Smith on his incredible WIN!'

Saudi Arabia has for two decades denied any involvement in the attacks, though 15 of the 19 men who hijacked and crashed four planes that day in New York City, Pennsylvania and at the Pentagon were Saudi nationals.

The FBI released documents from its investigation, dubbed Operation Encore, in November 2021 after Biden ordered them to be declassified.

The Bureau had explored, among other things, whether three people including one Saudi Embassy official in the US had advanced knowledge of the attacks.

An earlier memo released in September detailed the significant logistic support that two of the hijackers had received once within the country including 'procuring living quarters and assistance with assimilating.'

McGinley said 9/11 Justice has not heard from anyone on Trump's team since sending the letter.

Trump's track record with the Saudi government is complicated.

In 2016, he told FOX News that Saudi Arabia 'blew up the World Trade Center.

'Who blew up the World Trade Center? It wasn't the Iraqis. It was Saudis. Take a look at Saudi Arabia, open up the documents,' he told the network at the time. The people came, most of the people came from Saudi Arabia.

'They didn't come from Iraq,' Trump said in 2016 on Fox News.

But once in office, he remained friendly with the regime and even claimed to 'save' MBS's 'a**' after the CIA concluded he had ordered Khashoggi's 2018 murder.

Trump allegedly told journalist Bob Woodward: 'I saved his a**. I was able to get Congress to leave him alone. I was able to stop them.'

He referred to the Saudis as 'an important ally' and told how he'd jokingly instructed members of Congress to 'let them trade with Russia instead'.

'Let them buy a thousand planes from Russia instead of the United States. Fellas, you’ve got to be smart,' he said.

When Khashoggi was murdered and evidence grew that the killing had been ordered by the Saudi government, Trump played a safe hand publicly.

He said he was 'very angry' that Khashoggi had been killed, but claimed 'nobody had pointed the finger' at MBS or his regime.

Privately, he told Woodward: 'He says he didn't do it...he says very strongly that he didn’t do it. Bob, they spent $400 billion over a fairly short period of time.'

He later supported arms deals with the kingdom despite its proxy war in Yemen and refused to abandon his relationship with Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman - despite global outrage over the killing of Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi.

McGinley was on the phone with his brother before the plane plowed into the tower.

Daniel had just moved into his 'dream house' in Ridgewood, New Jersey and he and his wife Peggy were raising their five children there.

He said his brother was crying on the phone and telling him, 'I just want to get home to Peggy and the kids.'

'I've been haunting this conversation for the last 21 years,' McGinley said.

'One of the golfers said in their interviews, he's like, ""Look, you know, we're just trying to provide for our families."" Yeah, my brother Danny and 2,900 other people were just trying to provide for their families as well. And that was all horrifically taken away from them on 9/11.'

https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/feb/12/trump-impeachment-lawyers-fight-video-whataboutism,1,"Fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight. The first rule of Fight Club is just keep bashing your audience with the same word ad nauseam.

A video in which Joe Biden, Kamala Harris and other Democratic politicians uttered the word “fight” 238 times, according to a count by the MSNBC TV network, was the most bizarre turn yet at Donald Trump’s impeachment trial.

The montage was played by Trump lawyer David Schoen on Friday in an attempt to demonstrate that such language is common in today’s political discourse, and protected by the first amendment to the constitution, so Trump’s call for his supporters to “fight like hell” should not be blamed for the insurrection at the US Capitol.

“You didn’t do anything wrong,” Schoen told senators, many of whom had seen themselves on TV screens inside the chamber. “It’s a word people use, but please stop the hypocrisy.”

He was not wrong that it’s a word people use. Hillary Clinton, who was seen in the video, made Fight Song the theme of her ill-starred 2016 campaign against Trump. The world champion “fighter” is surely Senator Elizabeth Warren, who sprinkles the word in interviews liberally and wrote a book called This Fight is Our Fight.

But what Schoen was also doing was displaying whataboutism in its purest form – a wonder to behold, like a flawless diamond or pristine snow.

Whataboutism is a dodge often seen in rightwing media. If allegations are made against Trump’s connections in Russia, respond: what about Clinton’s emails? If Trump’s family are accused of exploiting their position, respond: what about Joe Biden’s son Hunter? If white supremacists are running riot, respond: what about antifa? It doesn’t matter if the equivalence is false because it’s all about attacking the opponent in order to muddy the waters.

The Trump legal team’s relentless “fight” video was a case in point. Some of the Democrats were quoted out of context due to selective editing. We heard Biden, for example, say “never, never, never give up this fight” but did not hear the full quotation: “I looked into the eyes of people who survived school shootings, and I made each of them a promise: I will never, never, never give up this fight.”

(Speaking of hypocrisy, Schoen accused the impeachment managers of “manipulating video” during his presentation.)

Still, the Trump defence cleared the very low bar set by their Laurel-and-Hardy opening on Tuesday

In addition, these Democrats were urging supporters to fight for a political cause. Trump was urging supporters to fight against democracy: his cause was based on the mendacious claim of a stolen election. And as the impeachment managers laid out on Thursday, he had spent years deploying incendiary rhetoric and demonising opponents.

Still, the Trump defence cleared the very low bar set by their opening Laurel-and-Hardy gambit on Tuesday. On Friday they provided talking points for rightwing media, straws for Republican consciences to clutch at and a boost for Trump’s spirits after some very grim days.

It was not hard to imagine the ex-president at Mar-a-Lago, his luxury estate in Florida, nodding in approval as lawyer Michael van der Veen kicked off in Trumpian style: “The article of impeachment now before the Senate is an unjust and blatantly unconstitutional act of political vengeance. This appalling abuse of the constitution only further divides our nation when we should be trying to come together.”

Van der Veen even described it as a “politically motivated witch-hunt”, a phrase the former president has used even more often than Warren has uttered “fight”.

In a first salvo of whataboutism, Van der Veen played video clips of Jamie Raskin, the lead impeachment manager, and other Democrats objecting to Trump’s victory in the electoral college in 2016. “To litigate questions of election integrity within the system is not incitement to insurrection,” he argued. “It is the democratic system working as founders and lawmakers have designed.”

The lawyer then falsely asserted that one of the first people arrested after the insurrection was a leader of antifa, when that individual denies any such affiliation and indeed antifa is a broad spectrum of far-left, anti-fascist groups, and not an organisation with a leader.

He claimed that Democrats had encouraged “mob violence” during the Trump presidency and played clips accompanied by ominous music.

The impeachment is “about Democrats trying to disqualify their political opposition”, he said, accuse them of indulging “constitutional cancel culture” – another phrase sure to play well on Fox News, Newsmax and the One America News Network.

Later, lawyer Bruce Castor argued that the attack on the Capitol was pre-planned – pipe bombs were planted a day earlier, for example – and so Trump’s fiery speech on 6 January could not have been the cause. However, the president had tweeted in December that the rally “will be wild”, and the prosecutors have shown Trump spent months laying the groundwork.

Castor also misnamed the Georgia secretary of state, Brad Raffensperger, referring instead to the NFL star Ben Roethlisberger, and quibbled over the definition of “insurrection” . After two and a half hours, the defence case rested. They had put up a fight, of sorts, but it was unlikely to be remembered alongside Winston Churchill’s “fight them on the beaches”.

Michael Beschloss, a presidential historian, tweeted drily: “Of all impeachment defense speeches in American history, Castor’s was the most recent.”","Fight, fight, fight: Trump lawyers subject senators to repetitive strain",1
https://www.theguardian.com/news/ng-interactive/2023/mar/29/from-the-archive-the-19th-century-guardian-views-on-slavery,1,"As an avowedly liberal newspaper committed to economic and individual freedom, the Manchester Guardian condemned slavery and supported its abolition. But it also excused enslavers and supported payment to compensate them for their loss of human “property”.

“The most important object of the statesman”, the paper announced in an 1828 editorial summarising its ideology, was “whatever is calculated … to aid the creation of wealth”. The paper vocally backed the campaign against slavery in the British empire – going so far as to encourage readers to sign petitions to this effect. But its stance on the 1833 Slavery Abolition Act insisted on the “justice” of a £20m payment to enslavers – which would be worth billions today – as well as the requirement that enslaved Africans served additional years in bondage as apprentices to their erstwhile owners.

The paper’s editorial columns, which expressed the views of its proprietor – and his ties to the cotton trade – deplored the existence of slavery in the United States, but disapproved of any radical prescriptions to end it. The Manchester Guardian did not support slavery in the American south, but regarded the civil war as an effort by the overbearing north to prevent the independence of the Confederate states – a war whose true motive, it claimed, had nothing to do with slavery. Above all, the paper resented and disputed the implication that any enemy of slavery should give unqualified support to the northern side.

In the eyes of the editors, slavery was above all an economic error. They believed that slavery would expire when forced into economic competition with the products of free labour, whether in British colonial territories or the United States.

ON BRITISH SLAVERY AND ABOLITION

The paper’s first decade saw the revival of the movement that had successfully won the abolition of the slave trade. Most publications in Britain were hostile to the campaign for emancipation, but Manchester was a centre of abolitionism, and the Guardian played a significant role through its persistent advocacy. Slavery was regularly covered by the paper through reports of Commons debates and antislavery lectures, publishing letters (similar to comment pieces) from abolitionists, articles from other papers and the occasional editorial. There was broad support from the paper for the antislavery campaigners, albeit with some reservations about tactics.

On 3 May 1823, the editorial column included a brutal account of the lives of the enslaved, followed by a call for “our fellow townsmen to lose no time in recording their detestation of slavery, by signing the petition against it” – a copy of which was available at the Guardian’s own offices. A week later, the paper reported that the petition “measures 129 feet in length, and contained 29,664 signatures”.

A few months later, on 15 November, a lengthy piece on the the evils of slavery from a Liverpool merchant appeared, along with a detailed graphic of the world showing areas of slavery. Meanwhile, a republished article from the Edinburgh Review on 4 September 1824 about slavery in America described slavery as a “national disgrace” and predicted a bloody war if not corrected.

A few days later, in response to a riot in Jamaica, the paper said: “Slavery thus brings its own curse, even to those who appear to profit by it; and the poor negro is, in some degree, revenged for the wrongs he has endured, but the terror and alarm which his slightest movements instil into the breasts of those who hold him in bondage.”

The editors often repeated the claim that free labour was more productive than slave labour – and therefore believed that slavery would come to an end around the world if the products of slave states, such as sugar, were forced into open competition with free states. “The great obstacle to the cheap growth of West India produce is, unquestionably, to be found in its being exclusively raised by the labour of slaves,” the paper wrote in May 1823. “The value of the labour performed in a given time by any number of slaves is much less than would be derived from a like number of freemen. The former have none of those incentives to exertion which perpetually invigorate the latter.”

In an 1827 editorial, the paper condemned the “odious West Indies monopoly” of the planters, adding: “The sole effect of it is to keep up the present horrible system of slavery in the colonies.”

The paper strongly backed the Slavery Abolition Act as it moved through the Commons in 1833, including support for the large sum of compensation to be awarded to enslavers, and the requirement that enslaved people serve for at least four years as apprentices before obtaining their full freedom.

An editorial from 15 June 1833 strongly defended the payment of compensation: “Nevertheless we are convinced, that no plan for the abolition of slavery could have been worthy to be proposed by the government, or adopted by the legislature, of Great Britain, which was not based on the great principles of justice to the planter as well as to the slave – none other could have satisfied the feelings of right-minded people of this country.”

It added: “The guilt of slavery attaches far more to the nation which has introduced, legalised, and supported it, than to the planters, many of who have, without any fault – indeed without any choice on their parts, become connected with the system. It is a national crime, and as such the pecuniary sacrifice which its destruction involves should be national also.”

This view was repeated on 10 August 1833, when, while talking about “the removal of a monstrous evil”, the paper stated: “We rejoice, that government has had the firmness and the honesty not to make this action [the abolition bill] the occasion of inflicting a deliberate wrong on a class of the community who were on every account entitled to great sympathy and consideration. The compensation to the West Indies proprietors has been rightly fixed on a liberal scale. Whether it may be somewhat more than strict justice requires is a point that we do not care nicely to investigate, because we consider that they are well entitled to the turn. Slavery was a national crime, and it is meet that the full sacrifice requisite for expiating it should be borne by the nation.”

An editorial on 4 July 1838, praised the success of the apprenticeship requirement, and contrasted the paper’s position with the more radical prescriptions of abolitionists who had opposed both compensation for enslavers and apprenticeship: “The most recent accounts from the West Indies afford strong grounds for hope, that the colonial legislatures … will themselves take means for putting an end to the negro apprenticeship system on the 1st of August next.

“We need scarcely repeat our conviction of the superiority of this mode of settling the question, over that proposed to parliament by the abolitionists … The termination of the apprenticeship will now, there is every likelihood, be brought about without any breach of the national honour, and under circumstances far more likely to render satisfactory the future relations between the white and the coloured population, than if it had been forced upon the planters by the British legislature.”

ON AMERICAN SLAVERY

Stories about slavery in America appeared regularly in the paper, often in the form of reprinted dispatches from American newspapers. Much of this coverage concerned the simmering conflict between forces for and against slavery in the United States. A typical dispatch, from 1836, reported that “the popular hatred against the slavery abolitionists, in the United States, continues to be exhibited occasionally in acts of violence. On the night of the 30th of July, the printing office of an abolition paper, the Philanthropist, published in Cincinnati [Ohio] was sacked; and the editor, Mr Birney, a lawyer and an accomplished gentleman, narrowly escaped with his life. Several negro-houses were torn down; and no attempt was made to arrest the mob until they threatened a building in which two of the city banks carried on their business – then the mayor interfered, and order was re-established”.

A number of American abolitionists, including formerly enslaved Black people, visited Britain in the 1840s and 1850s to deliver lectures on slavery, racism and lynching in the United States. As Manchester was a growing industrialising city with a dependence on slave-picked cotton, it was an obvious destination for many of these visitors, and the Guardian regularly advertised, and then often summarised, their public lectures.

One such visitor was Frederick Douglass, who spent 19 months in Britain and Ireland beginning in 1845, and delivered more than 300 lectures. (After his departure, the paper noted that his “eloquence, modest bearing, high character, and amiable disposition have won him ‘troops of friends’ in this country”.) The Guardian printed several short extracts from his autobiography in November and December 1845, as well as several reports from public meetings that Douglass addressed, in Manchester as well as Rochdale and Oldham. A very long account from an antislavery meeting in Chorlton-on-Medlock in 1847 reported that Douglass “said he was most happy to see so many assembled to hear the wrongs of his fellow countrymen set forth and was heartily glad that in Manchester such a congregation should assemble for the purpose of hearing the question of slavery discussed”.

The paper’s editorials consistently condemned the persistence of slavery in America, but complained that abolitionists underestimated the complexity of eliminating it – and bristled at any suggestion that the paper’s position was practically equivalent to approval.

After the passage of the 1850 Fugitive Slave Act, which authorised federal authorities to seize and return those who had escaped their enslavement, and required officials and citizens in “free” states to assist in the recapture of the formerly enslaved, the Guardian’s editorial noted the many protests against “the operation of this obnoxious measure”, which “seems destined to trouble the history of the United States far more seriously than its authors can be supposed to have foreseen”.

But it reserved the most severe criticism for “the tone which many of our English contemporaries adopt … the indignation which they lavish upon [its] authors”.

This outrage was misplaced, the editorial argued, because “the evil lies more deeply than they imagine” – the controversial act was “the natural corollary of the existing law on slavery”. Though it was “lamentable” that “in certain states, coloured men are as legal property as cattle”, the law must enforce property rights or else risk “the very fabric of society”.

“If men have property, they must be protected in its possession … It is utterly impossible that communities bound together … can live side by side in peace, while one half of them are weekly and hourly purloining the legal property of the others.”

“It must not be supposed that we are defending slavery,” the editorial concluded. “Far from it; but we recognise its existence and the complications it has produced.”

When the United States supreme court issued its infamous “Dred Scott” decision in 1857, ruling that enslaved Africans could never obtain the rights of citizenship and striking down the “Missouri compromise” that had limited the expansion of slavery into new states, the Manchester Guardian’s editorial correctly observed that civil war was likely: “On the monstrous immorality of the decision pronounced in the case of Dred Scott we have commented more than once. It solemnly commits the United States to the doctrine, of unparalleled injustice and barbarity, that persons born in the country, and fulfilling all the conditions of citizenship prescribed by law, are disqualified for civil privileges by reason of an African descent.

“In a political point of view, however, there is something more remarkable than the cruelty of this judgment, and that is the hopelessness of altering the infamous state of things which it proclaims … In any other part of the world the advent of this conflict … might safely be said to involve a certainty of civil war.”

ON THE AMERICAN CIVIL WAR

In the 1857 editorial on Dred Scott, the paper argued that this irreconcilable conflict had been caused by “the outrageous extreme to which the slaveholding interest” had pushed its cause in reaction to the “opportunity” created by the “fanaticism of the northern abolitionists”. When war began, the paper took the view that it should not be expected to condemn the southern states for seeking self-determination, nor to support the north’s war to prevent it.

In the paper’s account, the Union had kept the south in a backwards state for its own advantage – a condition that a famous editorial of May 1861 crudely likened to slavery itself: “The north supplied the south with everything upon which skilled labour had been employed, and the south paid for it in the slave-grown products of the soil. To the north this arrangement has secured a great home market for every kind of commodity that New England could produce, and for every article of merchandise that New York could import.

“A highly protective American tariff has enhanced the price of everything received by the south in exchange for its raw products and, while the population of the north has increased enormously, and every branch of northern industry has been developed, the population of the south has remained unprogressive and planters, tradesmen and the population generally are as poor, as indolent, and as extravagant as they have always been.

“To the south the bonds of the union have been as burdensome as the fetters to the negro, whom the south has kept in hopeless bondage.”

The paper argued that this economic arrangement effectively ensured the continuation of slavery; an independent American south would eventually eliminate it on its own, just as the north had once done: “When the war of the revolution severed the connection between England and the colonies, Massachusetts and New York were the South Carolina and Georgia of the time; and as the colonists began to supply themselves with manufactured articles England had before supplied, slavery in New England gradually expired.”

The British ruling class and its press were almost unanimous in their support of the south and distaste for the north, but the Guardian took particular umbrage at the suggestion its own position was in any way a compromise with slavery.

The paper’s tortured stance on the civil war was on full display in a long editorial of 2 November 1861, written in response to a letter published in the Times by Theodore S Fay, an American diplomat stationed in Europe. The editorial began with mocking praise: “When the rebellious southern states of America have been conquered and the Union restored, one of the wants of the hour will be to find a suitable reward for every one who has helped with the sword, with the voice, or with the pen, to promote the winning cause.”

Fay, the editorial continued, had exceeded even Brigham Young, the Mormon leader, “in those particularities of style imparted by a real, or professed, belief in one’s own exclusive claim to divine favour and protection … We have not seen anything like it for a combination of unctuousness and length.”

The Guardian position on the war asserted the evils of slavery and declared them obvious. But there was considerable scepticism that ending slavery was the real motive of the north, and scepticism as well that this was a just course of action even if it were the war’s true end. Editorials on the subject often displayed a simmering English liberal resentment at the suggestion, especially from impertinent and naive Americans, that opposition to slavery required full support for northern war aims, or the implication that anyone who did not fully support the north must therefore be in favour of slavery.

The 2 November 1861 editorial summarised the “abolitionist” view as such: “In the argument, if not the sincere belief, of [Fay], one circumstance colours the whole contest. On the part of the north, it is a war waged against slavery. The sin and the shame in our conduct, which will justly bring down on us national destruction, is our refusal to see the entire question in this simple light, and to act accordingly … No mixed feelings, no compromise, no halving between two opinions, is possible. Whosoever is not with the abolitionist is against him, and the abolitionists of the United States have always relied on being supported by the mother country whenever they should resolve to resort to force for the purpose of casting out the crying iniquity of their land.

“We should like to know on what part of our conduct, in recent time at any rate, this expectation was founded. Let us suppose, for the sake of argument, that it is as clear as Mr Fay would have it to be that the object with which the northerners are carrying on hostilities is the extermination of negro slavery.

“There are a great many things in the world which we do not like, but which we do not go to war to put down. Probably, the institution which, as a nation, we have the strongest hereditary antipathy to, is the Roman Catholic church, but there is not much probability of our inverting the conduct of the kings of Spain, and endeavouring to compel weaker peoples to renounce it at the point of the sword.”

Finally, citing British involvement in the Crimean war to protect the Ottoman empire from Russian incursions, the editorial likens the freedom of the Turks to pursue “a debased religion” to the freedom of the southern US to continue “an unjust an impolitic system of labour”, also known as slavery.

“The last time we went to war, it was to support a Mahometan nation [the Ottoman empire] in maintaining their position in Europe. We certainly do not think Mahometanism preferable to the Greek [Orthodox] form of Christianity. There are not many of us who do not consider it a moral and political abomination. But we uphold, as superior to our personal likings and dislikings, the right of a people, within very wide limits, to have what institutions they please, and we do not think that either a debased religion, or an unjust and impolitic system of labour constitutes an exception to the general rule.”

Police are carrying out an eviction order that was first put in place in November 2020, ordering it to be closed on health and safety grounds. But the decree had not been implemented, the Sun reported.

Ever since the asylum seekers arrived in the area, there has been friction between them and locals living in Chlorakas, who have called for the flats to be cleared.

Tensions were sparked further this week, however, following protests by residents and allegations of electricity theft.

It resurfaced after the state electricity utility cut power to the complex subsequently placing the local substation under guard.

Paphos police spokesman Michalis Nicolaou said: 'Personnel are in the area and have blocked off the building complex and begun to register all the foreigners who are settled in the specific complex in Chloraka.'

He said the migrants would then be taken to an asylum seeker centre to determine whether or not they have the right to stay on the island in the Mediterranean.

During his Save America rally in Conroe, the former president claimed that his supporters who broke into the Capitol last year are being treated ‘unfairly’ by President Joe Biden.

‘If I run, and if I win, we will treat those people from January 6 fairly. We will treat them fairly,’ he said to enthusiastic applause.

‘If that requires pardons, we will give them pardons, because they are being treated so unfairly.’

He also took aim at the Democrat-led House committee investigating the riot before turning his anger back to how the detainees are being treated.

‘This hasn’t happened to all of the other atrocities that took place recently, what that un-select committee is doing and what the people are doing who are running those prisons — it’s a disgrace,’ Trump said.

It comes as the panel steadily encroaches further into the ex-president’s inner circle — earlier this month its chairman Rep. Bennie Thompson formally asked his elder daughter Ivanka Trump to cooperate with Congress’ investigation.

Trump took the stage in the 7 p.m. hour on a chilly Saturday evening in Conroe, Texas

Lawmakers on the panel have been frank about their search for Trump’s ties to the riot and what kind of a role he played in undermining the 2020 election.

Turning back to the imprisoned rioters, he said: ’We will treat them fairly and we will take care of the people of this country.’

Over the last 12 months, the DOJ has charged hundreds of people in connection with the insurrection.

Trump’s allies in Congress like Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia and Rep. Matt Gaetz of Florida have claimed to witness their alleged poor treatment firsthand and have referred to them as ‘political prisoners.’

Trump’s supporters began arriving to the Montgomery County Fairgrounds on Saturday morning as the sun shone brightly in a cloudless sky.

One rally-goer, Tony Kraut from Dallas, said he wanted to see the former president launch a re-election bid in 2024.

‘He’s such a dynamic guy and he’s working for free, he’s not working for a paycheck, and he’s the only president who’s ran for presidency that’s not doing it for political gain. He’s doing it to protect our freedoms, protect our country, protect our borders — it’s like you and I protect our household,’ Kraut told DailyMail.com.

He pledged to pardon his supporters who were convicted in connection to the Capitol riot while yet again teasing a possible 2024 bid

Multiple Trump supporters told DailyMail.com they wanted the former president to run again

A Trump supporter named Melissa Jamerson, who said Saturday’s rally was her first, insisted she wanted the former president back sooner.

‘I want him back, like, right now,’ she said, adding that he could count on her vote in the next presidential election.

But not every fan in attendance felt the same — a voter who only identified himself as Rod from Montgomery County said he’s ‘not real sure’ he wants to see Trump run for president again.

‘He’ll be 80. I think that’s probably a little too old. I think he’s got plenty of time to get someone — a good successor with good views,’ Rod said.

He said Florida Governor Ron DeSantis could pick up the mantle.

Cody and Cheyenne of Conroe said they ‘absolutely’ wanted Trump to run in 2024, but wanted Republicans to focus on the economy, the border and job growth in the much nearer midterm elections in November.

The former president released a statement on Saturday morning touting how many of his supporters had already gathered at the Montgomery County Fairground ahead of his evening rally.

'Big crowd already gathering in Texas for tonight, see you there!' Trump said.

Trump collected some serious money ahead of his Conroe rally, hosting a $100,000 per couple lunch and a second fundraiser on Saturday before he took the stage. The money is for a new political action committee, Make America Great Again Again.

The former president charged couples $100,000 to join him and Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick for lunch in Houston, at an undisclosed location.

The Houston Chronicle reported it was to be followed by a $5,000 a couple reception at Lake Conroe, where hosts include Major League Baseball legend Roger Clemens and state Attorney General Ken Paxton. Donors could pay as much as $50,000 to join a roundtable discussion.

And he dropped into an event hosted by his son Don Jr called the American Freedom Tour.

The visit marks Trump's first visit to Texas in two years, to the reddest county in a state where Democrats are making inroads.

U.S. Capitol Police are preparing for truckers protesting the mask and vaccine mandates as the 'Freedom Convoy' heads to Washington, D.C. after demonstrating in Canada for weeks and causing major blockades.

The protesters were able to block the Ambassador Bridge border crossing between Windsor and Detroit as they expressed their distaste with COVID-19 mandates related to mask wearing and compulsory vaccinations.

Now, Californians are planning to join an American protest dubbed 'The People's Convoy' and head to Washington, D.C. this week.

This new demonstration is scheduled to depart from Barstow, California on Interstate 40 on Wednesday. National organizer of the effort Maureen Steele said she would not disclose the specific location for fear of retribution.

Steele told Newsmax that somewhere around 1,000 trucks are expected to start the trip and she expects more will join in as the convoy heads east.

'The Canadian convoy was pretty organic when it happened,' Steele acknowledged. 'Ours, they had a month's notice, so our concern is disruptive groups coming in. We're trying to just prepare for counter-protests and to take safety precautions for that.'

'This is about our rights, as well as the freedom of future generations,' convoy organizers wrote on Facebook. 'It's not about political parties, but more so about a government that has forgotten its place and has no regard for our founding fathers' instructions.'

Security officials are putting back up the fence around the Capitol in preparation for these protests to hit the nation's Capitol just as Biden delivers his biggest speech of the year, Fox News reported on Sunday.

The fencing that surrounded the Capitol Complex for much of 2021 will be reinstalled next week as U.S. Capitol Police (USCP) secure the area ahead of President Joe Biden's first State of the Union address on March 1

The U.S. has been loosening mask requirements and vaccination mandates ahead of the speech and as the 2022 midterm elections come underway after polling shows Americans are becoming less concerned with the coronavirus threat and more worried about economic, inflation and tax issues – as well as education.

At least four blue states have ended their mask mandates for schools, a move the White House has condemned due to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines on indoor masking.

Images emerged on Sunday of another 'Freedom Convoy' protest outside the Michigan Capitol Building in Lansing.

Cars with American and 'Don't Tread on Me' flags drove around Lansing on Sunday and donned paint on their cars reading slogans of 'Freedom Convoy' and 'Honk for Freedom.'

United States Capitol Police (USCP) released a statement Friday claiming they are 'aware' that trucker protesters are coming to D.D.c are are preparing to 'facilitate' expression of the First Amendment while securing the Capitol for Biden's address.

The fencing erection comes as anxiety over security on Capitol Hill continues following the January 6, 2021 attack that saw a handful killed and dozens to hundreds injured in the midst of Congress certifying the 2020 presidential election results.

USCP says they are working with several law enforcement agencies in the area as well as the D.C. National Guard to secure the complex before Biden's first State of the Union.

'Law enforcement agencies across the National Capital Region are aware of plans for a series of truck convoys arriving in Washington, DC around the time of the State of the Union,' the statement said. 'As with any demonstration, the USCP will facilitate lawful First Amendment activity.'

The continued fencing surrounding the Capitol last year gave rise to Republican criticism and claims that Democrats were trying to create a barrier between government and the people.

Democrats, mainly House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, insisted the fencing was a needed precaution following the January 6 riot.

The Aurora Police Department said on Twitter that protesters were walking on Interstate 225 Saturday when a vehicle drove through. Police said a protester fired a weapon, striking at least one person who was taken to a hospital in stable condition.

Authorities said the vehicle was towed and they are investigating. Protesters also broke windows at the courthouse and a fire was started in an office, police said. An unlawful assembly was declared and police ordered protesters to leave the area, authorities said.

Tensions have been heightened at recent protests against racial injustice since federal officials were sent to quell demonstrations in Portland, Oregon. Police declared a riot in Seattle on Saturday.

Protests sparked by the 25 May death of George Floyd, a black man in Minnesota who died after a white police officer kneeled on his neck for eight minutes, have also highlighted other cases of fatal police violence.

In Colorado, protesters have been drawing attention to the death of Elijah McClain, who was stopped by police while walking down an Aurora street in August 2019 after a 911 caller reported him as suspicious. Police placed him in a chokehold, and paramedics administered 500 milligrams of ketamine, a sedative, to calm him down. He went into cardiac arrest, was later declared brain dead and taken off life support.

In Kentucky meanwhile, hundreds of armed, predominantly black, activists demanded justice for Breonna Taylor during peaceful demonstrations in Louisville that drew counter-protesters from a white militia group.

Police closed streets and set up barricades to keep the two groups apart as tensions remained high in a town where protests have flared for months over the death of Taylor, a black woman killed when police burst into her apartment in March.

By the time black activists dressed in black fatigues arrived in the heart of downtown Saturday afternoon, most of the white militia members had already left. Police in full riot gear looked on.

Earlier in the day, three people were accidentally shot at a park where black activists had gathered, police said. The victims, all of whom were members of the militia group, were taken to a hospital with non-life-threatening injuries, police said.

“This is a tragic situation that could have been much worse,” Louisville metro police chief Robert Schroeder said in a news release. “I encourage anyone choosing to exercise their second amendment rights to do so responsibly.”

The only confrontation among the competing groups appeared to occur earlier Saturday when white militia members and Black Lives Matter activists yelled at each other over the police barricades.

Kentucky attorney general Daniel Cameron’s office is heading an investigation into Taylor’s death.

Taylor, a 26-year-old EMT, was fatally shot when police officers burst into her Louisville apartment using a no-knock warrant during a narcotics investigation. The warrant to search her home was in connection with a suspect who did not live there and no drugs were found.","Car drives through Black Lives Matter protest in Aurora, Colorado",1

Manchester City Football Club have secured a 2023 treble win of the Premier League, FA Cup and Champions League - after beating Inter Milan in the Champions League Final in Turkey.

Fans poured out onto the streets of Manchester with flags and beers while raucous chants of 'City, City' and 'Champions of Europe, we know what we are' echoed around Piccadilly Gardens.

Manager Pep Guardiola and his players will show off all three trophies on an open-top bus parade around Manchester on Monday evening, ending with a stage show on the main Princess Street.

Cllr Bev Craig, leader of Manchester Council, said: 'Winning the treble, crowned with an historic first Champions League triumph, is an incredible achievement.

'We extend our congratulations on behalf of the city to the club and its fans.'

She added: 'We're sure the parade will be a joyous and unforgettable occasion as fans gather in the city centre to celebrate with the team a success which will resonate around the world and showcases once again Manchester's huge sporting legacy.'

The Millar Library at PSU had been occupied since Monday. During the clearing, police arrested at least 30 activists.

Earlier at PSU, footage showed a student protestor crashing into a police officer while holding a makeshift shield and being arrested has emerged.

The video shows two mask-clad protestors carrying shields made out of trash cans running directly toward a police officer as people cheered in the background.

One of the protestors is then seen crashing into the official but ends up getting knocked down to the ground.

Elsewhere, in the pre-dawn hours, helmeted police swarmed a tent city set up at the University of California in Los Angeles, using flash bangs and riot gear to push through lines of protesters who linked arms in a futile attempt to halt their advance.

Los Angeles police said on social media that 210 people were arrested at UCLA, and hundreds of arrests were made at other universities overnight and on Thursday.

'I'm a student here,' one UCLA protester told cameras as he was led away, his hands bound. 'Please don't fail us. Don't fail us.'

Hours later, the student, who would only give his first name as Ryan, was back on campus and vowed he would not stop fighting.

'We will be back,' said Ryan, who was cited for unlawful assembly. 'We will be disrupting. We will be demanding divestment.'

Students have rallied or set up tents at dozens of universities in recent days to protest Israel's war on Gaza.

Demonstrators have called on President Joe Biden, who has supported Israel's right to defend itself, to do more to stop the bloodshed in Gaza and demanded schools divest from companies that support Israel's government.

Many of the schools, including Columbia University in New York City, have called in police to quell the protests.

Protestors in Portland State University raided the school library to graffiti pro-Palestine messages on the walls

Biden broke his silence on the demonstrations on Thursday after the UCLA raid, saying Americans have the right to protest but not to unleash violence.

'Destroying property is not a peaceful protest,' he said at the White House. 'It's against the law. Vandalism, trespassing, breaking windows, shutting down campuses, forcing the cancelling of classes and graduations - none of this is a peaceful protest.'

Biden, who is seeking re-election in November against Republican former President Donald Trump, has walked a careful line as he confronts criticism from both the right and the left over his Israel policy.

At UCLA, police repeatedly urged demonstrators to clear the protest zone, which occupied a central plaza about the size of a football field, before they moved in.

Dozens of loud explosions were heard from stun grenades, fired by police, while demonstrators, some carrying makeshift shields and umbrellas, chanted 'push them back' and flashed bright lights in officers' eyes.

Live TV footage showed officers taking down tents and tearing apart makeshift barricades.

Some of the protesters had been seen donning hard hats, goggles and respirator masks in anticipation of the siege a day after the university declared the encampment unlawful.

By morning, the plaza was strewn with detritus from the destroyed encampment: tents, blankets, food containers, a Palestinian flag, an upturned helmet. Police remained on hand during the first half of the day as the area was cleaned of debris.

In Portland, Oregon, police entered the Portland State University library on Thursday morning, where demonstrators had barricaded themselves since Monday. Several dozen protesters ran out of the building and rushed into a phalanx of officers in riot gear, who arrested them.

Police made more arrests at the library on Thursday night as demonstrators attempted to retake it. A university spokesperson said it was a 'very fluid situation.'

In New Hampshire, police arrested approximately 100 protesters in separate incidents at Dartmouth University and the University of New Hampshire overnight, breaking up encampments.

The protests follow the deadly Oct. 7 attack on southern Israel by Hamas militants from the Gaza Strip, which killed 1,200 people and saw dozens taken hostage, and an ensuing Israeli offensive that has killed about 34,000 and created a humanitarian crisis.

The campus demonstrations have been met with counter-protesters accusing them of fomenting anti-Jewish hatred. The pro-Palestinian side, including some Jews opposed to Israeli actions in Gaza, say they are being unfairly branded as anti-Semitic for criticizing Israel's government and expressing support for human rights.

UCLA had canceled classes for the day on Wednesday following a violent clash between the encampment's occupants and a group of masked counter-demonstrators who mounted a surprise assault late Tuesday night on the tent city.

UCLA Chancellor Gene Block, in a written statement, said that officials had allowed the encampment to remain on campus for several days as it was peaceful at first, but that the clashes with the pro-Israeli crowd clearly put students in harm's way.

'It led to unsafe conditions on our campus and it damaged our ability to carry out our mission,' Block said of the encampment. 'It needed to come to an end.'

Taylor Gee, a 30-year-old pro-Palestinian protester and UCLA law student, said the police operation on Thursday felt 'especially galling' to many protesters given the slow police response a night earlier.

'For them to come out the next night to remove us from the encampment, it doesn't make any sense, but it also makes all the sense in the world,' he said.

UCLA officials said the campus, with nearly 52,000 students, would remain shuttered except for limited operations on Thursday and Friday.",Moment cops raid Portland State University's library after it was taken over by anti-Israel protesters following another night of chaos on US college campuses,1

Security forces blocked the migrants’ path near the town of Frontera Hidalgo on Thursday afternoon, after hundreds had swept into Mexico across the Suchiate River that divides the country from Guatemala.

The migrants had stopped for the day at a shaded crossroads when security forces advanced and a brief attempt at negotiation stalled.

As the migrants knelt to the ground in prayer and began to chant “We want to pass,” national guardsmen advanced banging their plastic shields with batons. There was shoving and pepper spray as migrants were rounded up.

Many of the people allowed themselves to be escorted to the buses without resistance. Women cradling small children or holding kids’ hands wept as they walked toward the vehicles.

Others resisted and were subdued by guardsmen. One man dragged by four guardsmen shouted, “They killed my brother, I don’t want to die,” presumably in reference to the possibility of being returned to his country.

The road was left littered with water bottles, plastic bags and clothing.

Carrying US and Honduran flags at the head of the procession, the migrants had been walking on a highway toward hundreds of national guardsmen since crossing the Suchiate river from Guatemala at dawn.

Mexico has cracked down on the large caravans seen previously following intense pressure from Washington last year.

Aníbal, who declined to give his last name for fear of reprisal from immigration authorities, joined the majority Honduran caravan from his hometown of Santa Rosa, Guatemala. He and others rested in the shade of a tree on Thursday morning after walking for hours along the highway.

He was determined to get to the US, no matter where, and work to save money and return to his wife and three kids. Back home he worked part-time gigs as a laborer, machinist, selling used clothing, but there wasn’t enough work.

“They need to let us pass,” he said.

Asked about assertions from Mexico’s president that migration must be regular and orderly, he said: “He needs to have a little more compassion ... we’re going out of necessity. We’re not going for ambition.”

Thursday’s movement was a resurgence of a migrant caravan that had been diminishing since its last concerted attempt to cross the border on Monday was turned back by Mexican national guardsmen posted along Suchiate River, which forms the border here.

In previous caravans, Mexican authorities have allowed caravans to walk for a while, seemingly to tire them out, and then closed their path.",Central American migrants rounded up by armed guardsmen at Mexico border,1
https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/sep/09/thousands-need-aid-after-fire-destroys-europes-largest-refugee-camp,1,"Thousands of people urgently require emergency shelter and aid after a fire destroyed Europe’s largest refugee camp, on the Greek island of Lesbos.

As the Athens government declared a state of emergency and a delegation of officials rushed to the north-eastern Aegean island, the sheer scale of devastation wrought by the overnight blaze became increasingly evident.

In the mangled wreckage of gutted facilities, incinerated tents and blackened containers, Moria was no more. The camp whose overcrowded and unsanitary conditions had spawned global outrage since its inception in 2015 had been erased.

0:55 Thousands left without shelter as fire rips through Lesbos refugee camp – video

“At this moment the reception centre has been completely destroyed,” Greece’s alternate migration minister, Giorgos Koumoutsakos, told reporters, saying it was miraculous there had been no deaths or injuries. “As a result, thousands of people are homeless.”

Calling the situation an “unprecedented humanitarian crisis”, the politician said the coronavirus pandemic had created “exceptionally demanding” circumstances on the island, long at the forefront of refugees fleeing war-stricken homelands for the west. Eyewitnesses reported terrified and traumatised residents fleeing the hilltop facility through thick, acrid smoke laced with the stench of burning plastic.

At least three dozen people living in the camp had been diagnosed with Covid-19 before the fire erupted. Local islanders’ fears that the virus could spread were exacerbated when authorities admitted that by late afternoon on Wednesday they had only managed to locate eight of them.

Echoing other government officials who had alluded to arson, Koumoutsakos said it appeared the blaze broke out “as the result of the discontent” among camp residents over lockdown measures being prolonged following a positive virus test for a Somali asylum seeker.

Firefighters who rushed to the scene as flames whipped by gale force winds enveloped the camp spoke of the fire bursting into life in at least three places, suggesting it had been deliberately lit.

“It broke out on multiple fronts,” the north Aegean fire brigade chief, Konstantinos Theofilopoulos, told the state-run TV channel ERT. As teams battled to extinguish the flames they had “met resistance” from stone-throwing refugees, he said.

In a national address, the prime minister, Kyriakos Mitsotakis, told Greeks the four-month-long state of emergency would mean “national funds and all national forces assisting” in relief efforts on the island. “I recognise the difficult circumstances,” he said, expressing sorrow over the fire. “However, nothing can become an excuse for violent reaction to health checks. And, more so, for unrest of this extent.”

With EU help initiatives would be taken to turn “an ugly experience … into a better reality,” the leader insisted. As a frontier state Greece had borne an overly “heavy weight” in dealing with the “European problem” of handling migrant waves, he said.

In the dawn light as firefighters struggled to douse the flames, authorities threw a six-mile cordon around the camp to prevent its former residents from attempting to reach Mytilene, the island’s port town and home to most of its 85,000 population. Riot police units were flown in for reinforcement from Athens as Mitsotakis convened an emergency meeting of top ministers in his centre-right government.

“It’s an atomic bomb,” said Michalis Frantzeskos, the island’s deputy mayor in charge of citizens’ protection, referring to infection rates possibly increasing in the wake of the devastating blaze. “People have headed to the mountains, they’re [scattered] everywhere.”

For most of the day thousands of men, women and children clutching their frugal belongings and under a police guard lined the main road connecting Mytilene with the camp.

The facility, which had been under Covid-19 lockdown since March, was more than four times over capacity when the inferno erupted, with close to 13,000 people living there.

By nightfall it was announced that around a thousand of the most vulnerable refugees with disabilities and health problems would be hosted in a ferry boat as emergency workers sought frantically to gather enough tents. Two naval ships will also be dispatched to the island by Thursday with around 3,500 tents providing temporary shelter, the Greek migration minister Notis Mitarachi told a press conference.

“Moria as we have known it cannot continue,” he said, pledging that Athens would press ahead with the creation of “closed” detention camps in which the movement of people will be monitored more closely.

The prospect of the facilities has been deplored by human rights groups.

The EU’s commissioner for home affairs said Brussels would fund the transfer to the Greek mainland of some 400 unaccompanied minors also hosted in Moria.

Long on the frontline of the refugee crisis, Lesbos has been a magnet for men, women and children moving westward from Afghanistan, Syria, Iraq, Pakistan and ever more increasingly western Africa.

Although numbers have dropped dramatically since their peak five years ago, rickety boats crammed with people still arrive from Turkey, circumventing increased patrols put in place when the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, vowed to “open the gates” to Europe for hundreds of thousands of refugees.

More than 30 aid organisations, who have repeatedly described Moria as a stain on the consciousness of Europe, joined forces on Wednesday calling on the continent’s leaders “to share the responsibility for the reception and support of asylum seekers now more than ever”.",Thousands need aid after fire destroys Europe’s largest refugee camp,1

FBI agents searched Trump's home on Monday as part of an investigation into whether he took classified documents from the White House to his Florida residence.

The raid represents a dramatic and unprecedented escalation of law enforcement scrutiny of the former president.

But legal expert Alan Dershowitz, who served on Trump's legal team for the president's first impeachment case, questioned the Department of Justice's motive for the raid as he said it should only be used as a 'last resort'.

The Harvard law professor told 'Rob Schmitt Tonight' on Monday: 'A raid is supposed to be a last resort, but this administration has used the weaponization of the justice system against its political enemies.

'It's arrested people, denied them bail, put them in handcuffs - used all kinds of techniques that are not usually applied to American citizens, and I just hope this raid has a justification.

'If it doesn't have a justification, the material seized in it will be suppressed.'

Dershowitz added: 'I suspect it has to do with some investigations leading toward Donald Trump and some of his associates, but again, the law is clear: You don't engage in a raid unless you've exhausted all the other remedies – unless you believe that the person rated will destroy the evidence.'

Dershowitz later told Fox News: 'Based on what we now know, it was totally unjustified, even one FBI agent would have been too many.

'The whole process was wrong and Trump was away at the time, so they can't say he was going to destroy anything.'

Legal scholars have pointed to how when individuals have previously violated the law regarding classified documents, the Justice Department has chosen to either not prosecute or settle for lesser charges.

'The Presidential Records Act is not commonly a subject of criminal prosecution, even in the most egregious cases,' Johnathan Turley, a professor at the George Washington University Law School, told Fox News. 'These incidents have generally been handled administratively.'

It comes as the familiar battle lines, forged during a a four-year presidency shadowed by FBI and congressional investigations, quickly took shape again following the raid.

Trump and his allies sought to cast the search as a weaponization of the criminal justice system and a Democratic-driven effort to keep him from winning another term in 2024 - even though the Biden White House said it had no prior knowledge of it, and the current FBI director, Christopher Wray, was appointed by Trump five years ago and served as a high-ranking official in a Republican-led Justice Department.

Trump on Monday night called the search a 'weaponization of the Justice System, and an attack by Radical Left Democrats who desperately don't want me to run for President in 2024.'

Other Republicans echoed that message. GOP National Committee Chair Ronna McDaniel denouncing the search as 'outrageous' and said it was a reason for voters to turn out in November.

Trump's longtime friend and former attorney Rudy Giuliani said the raid on the former president's home is 'an absolute disgrace' and he feels 'embarrassment as an American'.

Speaking on WABC Radio's 'The Rita Cosby Show' on Monday night, Giuliani slammed the raid as 'phony' and said it 'goes way beyond politics.'

He said: 'It's a very, very sad night for America, and for me personally, who has spent many years of my life in the justice department at the lowest and the highest levels and worked very closely with the FBI to put some of the worst criminals of the 20th century in jail.

Trump's longtime friend and former attorney Rudy Giuliani said the raid on the former president's home is 'an absolute disgrace' and he feels 'embarrassment as an American'

EXCLUSIVE: Trump could be BANNED from holding public office if he is found guilty of mishandling classified White House records - and the legal saga will be a 'huge' development for his 2024 hopes, legal experts warn Former President Donald Trump could be banned from holding public office if he is found guilty of mishandling White House records. Federal law prohibits someone convicted of mishandling documents from holding any office in the US, legal experts have warned could be a 'huge' development for Trump's hopes to run for president in 2024. 'If Trump is convicted under this federal statute, he would be prohibited from holding any office including the office of the president,' former federal prosecutor Neama Rahmani told DailyMail.com. 'That would be huge.' Trump's Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Florida was raided by the FBI Monday, reportedly as part of an investigation into whether he took classified documents with him when he left presidential office. Trump, in his dramatic announcement of the raid, did not specifically say what the federal agents were looking for, just that his home was 'under siege, raided, and occupied by a large group of FBI agents.' Trump could be facing 'significant criminal exposure' if the FBI raid determines he destroyed government records, Rahmani, who is president of West Coast Trial Lawyers, told DailyMail.com Monday night. He said Trump would likely be charged under US Code Title 18, Section 2071 which involves concealment or destruction of US government documents. The code states that anyone who 'willfully and unlawfully conceals, removes, mutilates, obliterates, or destroys, or attempts to do so, or, with intent to do so takes and carries away any record' could be fined and sentenced to a maximum of three years in prison. The provision also states that anyone convicted of records concealment or destruction 'shall forfeit his office and be disqualified from holding any office under the United States.' 'His lawyers told him about the law requiring that he preserve White House documents, so he was on notice and that will bolster the case and help prove intent if prosecutors charge Trump.' Trump took 15 boxes of material with him in January 2021 after he left office. The boxes were returned to the National Archives a year later, in January 2022, but agents on Monday were reportedly looking to see if Trump had additional presidential records or any classified documents at his South Florida estate. 'FBI agents, in an investigation like this, are not always going to find every missing document or even discover every instance where a paper went missing,' Rahmani warned. 'It’s not hard to destroy documents and in some cases investigators will never find any evidence that a document even existed.' He added: 'In other instances, investigators can figure out something is missing, if for example they have testimony from a government official who says he was tasked with writing up a transcript and he did that, but the document can’t be found anywhere. Then you know someone destroyed it. But figuring out who did that can be another mystery.' Rahmani noted the raid of Trump's home was likely carried out only by agents involved in searching for documents that should have been in the National Archives. He said the agents investigating the January 6, 2021 insurrection at the US Capitol 'may have nothing to do with this operation.' 'But if evidence comes out from the raid that sheds light on Trump’s involvement in the Capitol Riot, then that will absolutely become part of the Jan. 6 investigation,' the legal expert added.

'I am ashamed of the leadership of the FBI and the Department of Justice, ashamed of two great institutions. They will go down in history as probably the two worst attorney general and FBI directors.'

'We don't have justice in America anymore, they've trashed it. This is the Biden police state. A sad night for America,' he added.

Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, a Republican who is considered a potential 2024 presidential candidate, said in a statement on Twitter that the raid was 'an escalation in the weaponization' of U.S. government agencies.

Kevin McCarthy, the House Minority Leader, said in a tweet that the Justice Department 'has reached an intolerable state of weaponized politicization' and said that if Republicans win control of the U.S. House, they will investigate the department.

That Trump would become entangled in a probe into the handling of classified information is all the more striking given how he tried during the 2016 presidential election to exploit an FBI investigation into his Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton, over whether she mishandled classified information via a private email server she used as secretary of state.

Then-FBI Director James Comey concluded that Clinton had sent and received classified information but the FBI did not recommend criminal charges because it determined that Clinton had not intended to break the law.

Trump lambasted that decision and then stepped up his criticism of the FBI as agents began investigating whether his campaign had colluded with Russia to tip the 2016 election. He fired Comey during that probe, and though he appointed Wray months later, he repeatedly criticized him too as president.

Thomas Schwartz, a Vanderbilt University history professor who studies and writes about the presidency, said there is no precedent for a former president facing an FBI raid - even going back to Watergate.

President Richard Nixon wasn't allowed to take tapes or other materials from the White House when he resigned in 1974, Schwartz noted, and many of his papers remained in Washington for years before being transferred to his presidential library in California.

'This is different and it is a sign of how unique the Trump period was,' said Schwartz, author of 'Henry Kissinger and American Power: A Political Biography.' 'How his behavior was so unusual.'

Trump, who disclosed the search in a lengthy statement, asserted that agents had opened up a safe at his home and described their work as an 'unannounced raid' that he likened to 'prosecutorial misconduct.'

The search intensifies the months-long probe into how classified documents ended up in more than a dozen boxes located at Mar-a-Lago earlier this year.

It occurs amid a separate grand jury investigation into efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election and adds to the potential legal peril for Trump as he lays the groundwork for another run.

'These are dark times for our Nation, as my beautiful home, Mar-A-Lago in Palm Beach, Florida, is currently under siege, raided, and occupied by a large group of FBI agents,' Trump wrote. 'Nothing like this has ever happened to a President of the United States before.'

'After working and cooperating with the relevant Government agencies, this unannounced raid on my home was not necessary or appropriate,' Trump said in his statement.

Justice Department spokesperson Dena Iverson declined to comment on the search, including about whether Attorney General Merrick Garland had personally authorized it.

Trump did not elaborate on the basis for the search, but the Justice Department has been investigating the potential mishandling of classified information after the National Archives and Records Administration said it had retrieved from Mar-a-Lago 15 boxes of records containing classified information earlier this year.

The National Archives said Trump should have turned over that material upon leaving office, and it asked the Justice Department to investigate.

There are multiple federal laws governing the handling of classified records and sensitive government documents, including statutes that make it a crime to remove such material and retain it at an unauthorized location.

Though a search warrant does not suggest that criminal charges are near or even expected, federal officials looking to obtain one must first demonstrate to a judge that they have probable cause that a crime occurred.

Two people familiar with the matter, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss an ongoing investigation, said the search happened earlier Monday and was related to the records probe. Agents were also looking to see if Trump had additional presidential records or any classified documents at the estate.

Supporters of former President Donald Trump were spotted outside his Mar-a-Lago home on Monday to back the ex-Commander in Chief after it was announced it had been raided by the FBI

Trump has previously maintained that presidential records were turned over 'in an ordinary and routine process.'

His son Eric said on Fox News on Monday night that he had spent the day with his father and that the search happened because 'the National Archives wanted to corroborate whether or not Donald Trump had any documents in his possession.'

Asked how the documents ended up at Mar-a-Lago, Eric Trump said the boxes were among items that got moved out of the White House during 'six hours' on Inauguration Day, as the Bidens prepared to move into the building.

'My father always kept press clippings,' Eric Trump said. 'He had boxes, when he moved out of the White House.'

Trump emerged from Trump Tower in New York City shortly before 8 p.m. and waved to bystanders before being driven away in an SUV.

In his first public remarks since news of the search surfaced, Trump made no mention of it during a tele-town hall on behalf of Leora Levy, the Connecticut Republican he has endorsed in Tuesday's U.S. Senate primary to pick a general election opponent against Democratic U.S. Sen. Richard Blumenthal.

Trump gave his public backing to Levy late last week, calling her on Monday the best pick 'to replace Connecticut's joke of a senator.'

The probe is hardly the only legal headache confronting Trump. A separate investigation related to efforts by Trump and his allies to undo the results of the 2020 presidential election - which led to the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the U.S. Capitol - has also been intensifying in Washington. Several former White House officials have received grand jury subpoenas.

Officials at Penn State were forced to cancel the event at the eleventh hour after Stein and McInnes attracted an army of protesters - who eventually forced the provocateurs to flee the scene on Monday night.

In a brief statement, Penn State officials said: 'Due to the threat of escalating violence associated with tonight’s event, Penn State University Police determined that it was necessary to cancel the speaking event in the interest of campus safety.'

It had been due to take place at 8.00pm on Monday night. The cancelation was announced around an hour before.

The event was hosted by Uncensored America, a free-speech group based at Penn State. Since the evening was announced, there had been calls from protesters to cancel it. Those calls went unheeded by school officials.

'Professional troll' Alex Stein recorded himself mocking a Penn State student protester prior to his appearance alongside Gavin McInnes

The student got more angry as he told Stein that she 'f***ing' hated him

Eventually, Stein's mocking became too much and the unnamed student spat on the BlazeTV host

After she spat on him, Stein said: 'I like that fetish' and 'That turns me on.'

In the shocking video, Stein can be heard telling the protester: 'You're my favorite' repeatedly. The protester tells him: 'You are the reason that I feel unsafe in this town! You are the f***ing reason that we're all here today! You are the reason people feel unsafe in this country. I f***ing hate you!'

Stein responds with: 'I love you. I think you're a nice woman.' That prompts the student to spit on Stein. He yells down the camera: 'Woah, she spit on me!' He tells here: 'I like that fetish' and 'That turns me on.'

He later tweeted: 'Penn State Shut Down My Speech on Campus Today! Free Speech Doesn’t Exist for Conservatives!' Stein and McInnes were recorded in a video posted by Penn State's Collegian newspaper hurrying into a waiting car with a police escort.

Stein is the host of Conspiracy Castle on the little-watched BlazeTV. Prior to Monday's events, he was best known for sexually harassing Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez on the steps of the Capitol, telling her that she was his 'favorite big booty Latina.'

When the announcement came through that the event was not going ahead, the protesters broke out in cheers. There has been no official announcement regarding how many, if any, arrests were made.

Photos from the scene showed student demonstrators and local law enforcement, many on horseback, surrounding the Thomas Building, where the event was scheduled to take place.

Multiple reports suggested that supporters of McInnes and Stein were present in the form of the Proud Boys, the neo-fascist, politically violent, organization.

Protesters shouted slogans such as: 'We are not afraid of the Proud Boys.' Another group could be seen holding banner reading: 'White Supremacists Off Our Campus.'

Some of the activists alleged that they had been pepper sprayed by Proud Boys members. Vice News' Tess Owen tweeted: 'Fascists in all black just pepper sprayed a bunch of protesters (and media).' In addition to founding the Proud Boys, McInnes was also one of the founders of Vice Media.

Multiple photos from the scene showed protesters attempting to flush the stinging spray out of their eyes with water and milk.

Monday's event was titled Stand Back & Stand By, a reference to the not-so subtly coded message given by ex-President Donald Trump to the Proud Boys during a presidential debate in 2020.

The group has been in the crosshairs of the Department of Justice due to members alleged roles in the January 6th Capitol riot. Despite founding the group, McInnes has distanced himself from the group in recent times.

On October 11, a statement from the school said that it was Uncensored America's 'undeniable constitutional right to sponsor this presentation on our campus' despite disagreeing with the sentiments expressed by Stein and McInnes.

Following the event's cancelation, the Penn State statement read: 'The University has been clear that the views and speech of the two speakers at tonight’s student-organization-hosted event are abhorrent and do not align with the values of Penn State.'

It went on: 'We have encouraged peaceful protest, and, while protest is an acceptable means of expression, it becomes unacceptable when it obstructs the basic exchange of ideas. Such obstruction is a form of censorship, no matter who initiates it or for what reasons.'

'The University expects that people engaging in expressive activity will demonstrate civility, concern for the safety of persons and property, respect for University activities and for those who may disagree with their message, and will comply with University rules,' the press release added.

It concluded: 'The climate in our nation has been polarized for quite some time. On campuses across the country, violence is proliferating and individuals are being intimidated and even harmed. This must stop.'

https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/jun/08/five-injured-as-police-and-activists-clash-at-french-motorway-protest,1,"Police and masked activists clashed at a protest over a motorway project in southern France on Saturday, leaving five people hurt, local officials said.

Thousands of demonstrators ignored a ban on the gathering to turn out for the protest at the site of the A-69 motorway between Castres and Toulouse in the south-west.

A police officer hit by a molotov cocktail, two paramilitary gendarmes and two protesters were injured during the clashes, said the regional authorities.

Ecologists and leftwing activists are trying to stop an extension of the motorway, which scientists say will destroy wetlands, farmland, trees and underground water sources.

The first clashes broke out at about 3pm (1pm GMT) when “radicalised protesters ... determined to commit acts of violence” tried to reach a main road, a statement from local officials said.

Riot police used teargas to try to disperse the demonstrations and keep them from the road leading to the construction site. Some of the protesters launched fireworks and hurled molotov cocktails at security forces.

The prefecture of the Tarn region denounced “extremely violent attacks with catapults” and said the crowd contained “1,200 radical individuals”.

They had “clearly come to cause damage with no link to the issue” of the motorway, said a statement from the prefect, Michel Vilbois.

“We have a duty to step in,” said one activist from climate campaign group Extinction Rebellion. “As long as we are there, the motorway will not go ahead,” she added.

Organisers of the protest near the village of Puylaurens, which was called by the Roue Libre group, said 7,000 activists had turned up. The prefecture put the figure at 1,600.

About 1,600 police and gendarmes were deployed to deal with the protest.

The project, started at the beginning of 2023, has the backing of most local elected officials and the extension is due to come into service at the end of 2025.",Five injured as police and activists clash at French motorway protest,1

Protesters carrying banners with anti-tourism slogans and banging drums gathered at the Plaza de España in the centre of the capital Palma de Mallorca.

Police officers armed with batons and wearing stab proof vests surveilled the area as the demonstration from riot-protected police vans began at 7pm local time.

The city's main road was closed by authorities as the protesters marched around the old town. Onlookers applauded from the pavements as the demonstrators chanted for 'help'.

The Spaniards are calling for fewer holiday flights, a clampdown on cruise ships and the slashing in the number of rental cars available under the slogan; 'Mallorca is not for sale!'

Protesters left the march to confront foreigners and tell them to 'Go Home' as they watched the demonstration go past.

One woman in her 60's yelled: 'Foreigners Go home you are killing us! You are not dropping bombs but you are killing us with property speculation.'

People from all walks of life gathered to call for limits on the number of visitors which they accuse of ruining the lives of locals by inflating property prices, causing traffic jams and driving up the cost of living.Among the marchers are teachers, hotel workers, businessmen and retired people who have told how the huge number of visitors have ruined the once idyllic Spanish sun-spot, with one family forced to leave the island due to the spiralling cost of property.Today's march is the latest anti-tourism protest across Spanish territories, following demonstrations in the Canary Islands, Barcelona and neighbouring Ibiza.

Mother-of-three Patri Vecina told MailOnline: 'We have lived in the same rented house for ten years. But in December the owner told us that he was selling the property to foreigners and that we had to move out.

'I work in the hotel industry and my husband is a builder. We

cannot afford the inflated price of property in Mallorca so we were never able to buy our own home.

'Now we cannot afford to live in Mallorca anymore we are moving to Asturias in the north of Spain.

'It was our dream to bring up our children in Mallorca but that cannot happen.'

Patri and her husband were initially paying £500 per month (Euro 500) for the rural three-bedroom house in the centre of the island. This increased to £690 per month (Euro 750) before their landlord put the house up for sale.

The country house on the outskirts of the town of Sencelles is now for sale for £383,000 (Euro 450,000).

Demonstrators staged another protest against tourist overcrowding in Ibiza on Friday

Property prices in Mallorca have more than doubled in the past ten years, making the Balearic Islands the second most expensive region in Spain after Madrid.

In 2014 a typical 80 square metre home cost an average of £126,000 (Euros 147,000) but this has gone up 208 per cent to an average £263,000 (Euros 308,000), according to Spanish property website Fotocasa. Where as the national increase across the whole of Spain was 29 per cent during the same period.

The spike in the property prices has been fuelled by foreign investors, many of whom have turned family homes in tourist rental accommodation, local campaigners claim.

Laura Lau, of El Banc de temps Sencelles pressure group that coordinated the demonstration, told MailOnline: 'Houses and apartments that were family homes have been bought by foreign investors who rent them out to tourists and leave nothing for local people. This is why property prices in Mallorca have reached unaffordable levels.

'We need to make people aware of the problem of housing in Mallorca which already affects us all.

'Every day there is someone looking for new housing because their rent has gone up or they are kicked out of their home because it has been put up for sale to foreigners.

'Many of them are now leaving Mallorca because when they work and earn Euro 1,500 per month it is not enough to afford a home.

'We are in a housing emergency. The government needs to regulate the price of housing.

'There is no future for Mallorca if the island is solely for the benefit of property speculators.'

The average salary in Mallorca is about is about £1,277 (Euro 1,500) per month or £15,324 per year, although the island's minimum wage is just £965 (Euro 1,134) per month or £11,580 per year.

Teacher Marga Gari told how her children will never be able to afford to buy their own homes because of the spiralling cost of living.

Marga, 50, told MailOnline: 'Quite simply there are too many tourists. My children will never be able to buy their own homes because foreigners have pushed to price of property up.

'Everything is more expensive than it should be because of tourists – food in the market, clothes in stores, everything.

'You can hardly walk down the streets here in Palma because of the number of visitors.

'We do not blame the foreigners; we blame the government for letting things get this bad.

'There needs to be limits; limits on the number of planes, a limit of one cruise ship per day and a limit on the number of rental cars.'

Protestors in Ibiza hold up posters including one reading 'my lawyer lives in a rented car' during a rally against tourism on Friday

Ms Gari claims many items in Palma's historic Mercat de l'Olivar central food market are now beyond the reach of local people.

Her colleague Marta Cano, 40, told how she had to move home due to the spiralling cost of accommodation in the islands capital Palma.

She told MailOnline: 'The island is so crowded now, in the summer it's unbearable.

'I can no longer afford to live in the centre [of Palma] because tourists have pushed up the prices.

'There are traffic jams and the time, and the beaches are so crowded.

'There are people walking around the town with no shirts on. This is not the environment that I want my two-year-old daughter to grow up in.

'In the summer we leave the island. I cannot stand it. We go to the north of Spain where there are less people, where it more relaxed. '

Businessman Marc Rey told how he is forced live with his parents because of the cost of property.

Marc, 25, a financial consultant told MailOnline: 'I have a good job and I am paid well but I cannot afford to buy my own place. So I still live with my parents.

'I have nothing against foreigners but there needs to be a balance between the needs of the local people and the visitors who come here.'

Retired banker Pedro Torres claimed tourists were not solely to blame for the island being overwhelmed.

He said: 'In the past ten years some 200,000 people have moved to Mallorca. They are not all tourists, they are people from the mainland and South America. But together they create a big stress on our infrastructure.'

Nurse Catalina Estelrick added: 'We must limit the number of tourists coming to Mallorca. We are being overwhelmed. There are simply too many people.'","Thousands of demonstrators gather in Mallorca to protest against 'excessive tourism' which has inflated property prices, driven up the cost of living and created traffic chaos",1

'The United States Capitol Police has taken down the fence around the U.S. Capitol,' the agency said in a statement Sunday.

'These changes were made based on the current threat environment and recent enhancements to the USCP's response capabilities,' the statement continued.

Acting U.S. Capitol Police Chief Yogananda Pittman said: 'We are extremely grateful for the support we continue to receive in support of our critical mission. We are prepared to quickly enhance our security posture should the need arise.'

Despite the step toward reopening, the Capitol still remains closed to visitors, which has been the case since the onset of the coronavirus pandemic in March 2020.

Workers took down the remaining fencing surrounding the Capitol Building Friday and Saturday. Here a worker disassembles the fencing in front of the iconic rotunda

'These changes were made based on the current threat environment and recent enhancements to the USCP's response capabilities,' U.S. Capitol Police released in a Sunday statement

Members of the public enter and exit the Capitol plaza on Saturday as workers remove the security fencing, which has been in place since the January 6 Capitol riot

Fencing was put up around the entire Capitol Hill complex in January 2021, after a mob of pro-Trump supporters descended on Congress and breached the building in an attempt to stop the body from certifying the election for Joe Biden.

The large 'outer perimeter fence' was removed in March 2021, but a smaller fence around the actual Capitol Building remained in place. That fencing has now been removed.

'The Department greatly appreciates the community's patience and understanding during this challenging time,' USCP wrote in its statement on the fencing coming down.

Workers were pictured Friday and Saturday removing the remaining black fence surrounding the Capitol.

The public immediately began walking closer to the Capitol than they have been able to in more than half-a-year.

Republicans have been highly critical of USCP and Democrats' reluctance to take down fencing, send home deployed National Guard and reopen the Capitol to visitors.

Visitors, however, are still not permitted inside the building. The Capitol has been closed to the public since the onset of the coroanvirus pandemic in March 2020

The public immediately returned to the Capitol grounds Saturday after the fence was removed

The House sergeant-at-arms released a memo on Wednesday to all members of Congress and staff, which was obtained by DailyMail.com, announcing the impending removal.

'Based on USCP's assessment of the current threat environment and USCP's enhanced coordination with District of Columbia, neighboring state and federal law enforcement partners, the Board supports USCP's recommendation to remove the temporary fencing around Capitol Square. Removal is expected to begin as early as Friday, July 9th and conclude within three days, weather permitting,' it read.

The black perimeter fence is one of the last remaining signs of the January 6 riot. Even with its removal, the Capitol will remain closed to most visitors, the memo said.

Capitol cops initially set up 7-feet steel fences topped with razor wire and road blocks from the Lincoln Memorial to the Capitol in an operation that cost $1.2million, but it has since been scaled back.

The National Guard, which was deployed in the aftermath of the attack, also left in May after months.

The tall, black fencing was installed around the Capitol after the January 6 riot. The larger Capitol Hill perimeter fencing was removed in March 2021, and the remainder around just the Capitol building came down four months later

'Although the temporary fencing will be removed, current building access restrictions will remain in place,' according to the memo.

Federal officials are aware of online chatter from far-right groups and people who believe in conspiracy theories discussing potentially returning to Washington as part of an unfounded and baseless conspiracy theory that Trump will be reinstated in August.

Five people died in the January attack, including a Trump supporter shot and killed by police inside the Capitol and three people who suffered medical emergencies in the crowd.

One police officer, Brian Sicknick, died from a stroke a day later and two other officers later took their own lives.

On April 2, driver Noah Green, 25, rammed into barricades outside the Capitol and killed Capitol Police officer William Evans..

The U.S. Capitol Police will continue to monitor intelligence information and potential threats, and new fencing could be swiftly erected, the memo said.

'The Architect of the Capitol has the ability to and will expeditiously reinstall the temporary fencing should conditions warrant,' according to the memo.

The Capitol has been closed to most visitors for the longest stretch in the nation's history, the one-two hit of the coronavirus outbreak that shuttered operations last spring and the insurrection that kept it off limits.

The perimeter fence around the Capitol has been scaled down in the six months since January 6 to immediately surrounding the building

Capitol cops initially set up 7-feet steel fences topped with razor wire and road blocks from the Lincoln Memorial to the Capitol in an operation that cost $1.2million, but it has since been scaled back

It's now nearing 16 months.

The parklike grounds have been a favorite spot for visiting tourists to snap a photo of the iconic dome, and some 2.5 million visitors typically tour the inside of the building each year, among some 12 million who annually visit the campus-like complex of offices.

The memo came six months after the attack and followed consultations with the Capitol Police Board, the Capitol Police and congressional stakeholders.

Removal of the fence will take up to three days, weather permitting.

Lawmakers have been away for the Fourth of July holiday week, but some are expected to return Monday.

During the virus outbreak, House lawmakers have been working under a proxy voting system that enabled them to avoid travel during the pandemic, though most now vote in person. Senators have mostly been back to business as usual.",Fencing around the Capitol is finally removed SIX MONTHS after riot - but visitors can't go inside,1

29 Apr 2024 22.02 BST Closing summary Pro-Palestinian protesters at Columbia University were given an ultimatum to abandon their encampment or risk suspension, after the breakdown of talks aimed at having it removed voluntarily. The ultimatum, setting a Monday deadline of 2pm, has passed. Protesters overwhelmingly voted to defy the order and stay.

Texas governor Greg Abbott said no encampments will be allowed after at least five people were arrested by dozens of law enforcement officers, many in riot gear, at a protest at the University of Texas at Austin on Monday afternoon.

The Portland State University (PSU) will “pause” accepting donations from Boeing after students called on the school to cut ties with the manufacturer amid the war in Gaza, one of the first from university administrators to distance their school from a major weapons manufacturer.

Mike Johnson , the Republican speaker of the House who visited the Columbia University campus last week, reiterated his threat to revoke visas from foreign students involved in protests, and cut funding to universities that do not protect Jewish students.

Hakeem Jeffries, the Democratic House minority leader, released a letter to Johnson requesting consideration of a bipartisan bill to counter antisemitism.

Joe Biden and Mexican president Andrés Manuel López Obrador pledged to search for new ways to decrease border crossings by undocumented migrants, as the US president faces pressure to crack down on the issue of immigration ahead of the November elections.

Anyone who thinks Marjorie Taylor Greene will drop her threat to force the removal of Johnson is “high, drunk, or simply out of their mind”, a senior aide to the far-right Georgia congresswoman said.

The Biden administration announced that it “strongly opposes” a group of Republican-backed bills expected to be considered by the House this week that will target its environmental regulations.

Joe Biden is scheduled to travel to the key battleground state of North Carolina on Thursday, the White House has said.

Dozens of local and state police – including some in riot gear – were seen encircling the encampment. Several protesters have been seen being treated for heat-related illnesses, according to local media. Last week arrests were made at the Austin campus at the request of university officials and Governor Abbott, who said the protesters “belonged in jail”.

29 Apr 2024 21.26 BST Lauren Aratani The response from Portland State University (PSU) is one of the first from university administrators to distance their school from a major weapons manufacturer. Though hundreds of students across the country have been protesting on their campuses, setting up encampments demanding divestment from weapons manufacturers and companies with ties to Israel, many universities have repeatedly said they will not divest from Israel or manufacturers. Colleges and universities in the United States have endowments that they often use as financial buffers. Harvard, which has the largest endowment at $51bn, said that it “opposes calls for a policy of boycotting Israel and its academic institutions”. The University of California, which has an endowment of $169bn for its 10 campuses, also said that it “opposed calls for boycott against any divestment from Israel”. Share

In addition to setting up an encampment on campus, students also addressed a letter to Ann Cudd, the president of Portland State University (PSU), demanding the university cut ties with Boeing. In a campus-wide message, Cudd said she had been motivated by “the passion with which these demands are being repeatedly expressed by some in our community”. She wrote in her memo: PSU will pause seeking or accepting any further gifts or grants from the Boeing Company until we have had a chance to engage in this debate and come to conclusions about a reasonable course of action. Cudd reiterated that the university “has no investments in Boeing but accepts philanthropic gifts from the company and, given that Boeing is a major employer in the region, many of our alumni work there”.

29 Apr 2024 19.15 BST When he is not hobnobbing with Donald Trump, the administration of Florida governor Ron DeSantis’s is disenrolling children from a health insurance program for low-income residents, the Guardian’s Richard Luscombe reports: Florida is continuing to “callously” strip healthcare coverage from thousands of children in lower-income households in defiance of a new federal law intended to protect them. Since 1 January, more than 22,500 children have been disenrolled from Florida KidCare, its version of the Children’s Health Insurance Program (Chip) that is jointly subsidized by states and the US government for families with earnings just above the threshold for Medicaid. Florida healthcare officials admit at least some were removed for non-payment of premiums, an action prohibited by the “continuous eligibility” clause of the 2023 Consolidated Appropriations Act that took effect at the beginning of this year. The clause secures 12 months of cover if at least one premium payment is made. Last week, the administration of Republican governor Ron DeSantis challenged the rule in federal court Tampa, arguing it makes Chip an entitlement program that illegally overrides a state law requiring monthly payment of premiums.

29 Apr 2024 18.44 BST Jessica Glenza Donald Trump and Ron DeSantis met on Sunday for a golf course breakfast in an apparent attempt to thaw their relationship after the Republican primary. The meeting in Hollywood, Florida, was first reported by the Washington Post. Steve Witkoff, a Trump ally, New York and Florida real estate developer, and donor who testified at the former president’s civil fraud trial in New York, reportedly brokered the meeting. The Florida governor was once considered the former president’s top rival in the Republican presidential primary dominated by Trump, with a platform that rested primarily on fighting the “woke” cultural forces of diversity, inclusion and tolerance. However, a bungled presidential run meant DeSantis left the race after the Iowa caucus in January at the beginning of the primary. That left him in need of repairing his relationship with Trump – now the presumptive Republican presidential nominee – after aiming attacks at him for months. Relations have been frosty between DeSantis and Trump since the primary began. However, Trump has proven to be transactional with rivals when necessary, and the former president also stands to benefit from improved relations with DeSantis. The Florida governor developed a network of wealthy donors to back his presidential run, moneyed supporters Trump needs to woo if he hopes to catch up to the fundraising of Joe Biden, the Democratic incumbent seeking a second term in the presidency.

29 Apr 2024 18.13 BST More than 100 rights groups have sent a letter demanding Congress and Joe Biden reinstate funding to the UN relief agency for Palestinians (Unrwa). The letter comes after the president signed a $95bn foreign aid package that finalized the Biden administration’s suspension of US funding to the UN agency, a “lifeline for the Palestinian people in Gaza” that Israel has sought to disband. An independent review published last week said that Israel had yet to present evidence of its claims that employees of the relief agency are affiliated with terrorist organizations. On Wednesday, Germany, Unrwa’s second-biggest donor after the US, announced that it will resume cooperation and funding to Unrwa operations in the Gaza Strip. The letter by more than 100 immigrant, refugee, human rights and humanitarian organizations, seen by HuffPost, reads: Cutting off funding to Unrwa completely erodes the international community’s ability to respond to one of the worst humanitarian crises of our time. It added that international non-governmental organizations and other UN agencies have “repeatedly stated that they do not have the personnel, resources, or infrastructure to respond to the humanitarian needs in Gaza appropriately.” Share",Tensions high at Columbia University after protesters defy deadline to leave – as it happened,1
https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/may/13/georgia-police-accused-of-beating-protesters-against-foreign-influence-bill,1,"Riot police armed with water cannon and teargas have been accused of beating protesters who picketed outside Georgia’s parliament to try to stop a final vote on a controversial “foreign influence” law.

The fresh scenes of violence on Monday morning came as hundreds of masked officers charged down demonstrators who had been attempting to block off access to the parliament in the capital, Tbilisi.

Individual protesters were hauled away by officers and footage later shared on social media appeared to show two of those detained being kicked and punched by police.

The agency responsible for investigating allegations of police brutality, the Special Investigation Service, said later on Monday morning that it had opened a case into claims of use of excessive force.

The protesters have been seeking to stop a committee of MPs from signing off on a bill that would force non-governmental groups and media to register as “organisations serving the interest of a foreign power” if more than 20% of their funding comes from overseas.

Opponents of the bill, including the US state department, claim it is inspired by Russian legislation passed in 2012, which they say has been used to persecute critics of the Kremlin. The EU has warned that passing the legislation will damage Georgia’s chances of joining the bloc.

The demonstrators failed to keep MPs out of the parliamentary estate and the government-dominated committee passed the bill in 67 seconds at 9am. A final vote of the whole parliament will take place on Tuesday.

Georgia’s president, Salome Zourabichvili, who is opposed to the law, has the power to veto it but the governing Georgian Dream party has enough votes to overrule her in a vote.

The ministry of interior affairs said two US citizens and one Russian had been among 20 people arrested at the protest. “They violated public order, resisted and insulted law enforcement officers,” a spokesperson said.

The protest on Monday morning had been largely peaceful but there were outbreaks of violence when the riot police surged forward to isolate individuals, leading to plastic bottles being thrown at officers.

The crowd of about 2,000 people, many in their 20s, chanted “Russians, Russians, Russians” and “slaves, slaves, slaves”, and carried EU and Georgian flags. Many had been out for more than 24 hours, under constant drizzle.

Hundreds of thousands of people have joined protests in Tbilisi in recent months, claiming their government was seeking a closer relationship with Russia at the expense of its relations with the west.

Georgia, with a population of 3.7 million, joined countries trying to gain accession to the EU when it was granted official candidate status last December.

The government, which has been in power for 12 years, claims to be pro-EU but it has avoided placing sanctions on Russia over the war in Ukraine and critics claim it has been seeking to strengthen ties with the Kremlin.

The Dream party’s founder and honorary chair, Bidzina Ivanishvili, a former prime minister who made vast wealth in Russia, has recently repeated the conspiracy theory of a “global war party, which has a decisive influence on Nato and the European Union and which only sees Georgia and Ukraine as cannon fodder”.

Critics claim the foreign agents law is an attempt to stifle civil society in Georgia. A number of organisers of the protests against the proposed law have been targeted in recent days for brutal attacks at their homes or workplace by unidentified gangs.

Dimitri Chikovani, who was severely beaten by five men near his apartment building entrance in Tbilisi’s Sololaki district last Wednesday evening, said he had also received threatening phone calls.

Speaking to the Guardian after his release from hospital, Chikovani, who suffered fractured cheek bones and a broken nose, said he believed the government was behind the attacks.

He said: “The point is to make people fear them. But if I may add, it’s pointless and useless. Because people of Georgia, they have spoken, they have decided that the European way, the western civilisation, is the way of Georgia. Georgian Dream won’t stop it. We will protest until Georgian Dream stands back and stops the law.”",Georgia police accused of beating protesters against ‘foreign influence’ bill,1

Suspect Habibur Masum is still at large after 27-year-old Kulsuma Akter was ambushed in a shocking daylight attack while pushing her five-month-old son in a buggy during a shopping trip on Saturday.

Police have warned members of the public 'not to approach' the 25-year-old, who MailOnline revealed on Monday had been on bail after being charged with assaulting and threatening to kill Ms Akter last November, and to 'call 999 immediately' if they see him.

A worker at a shop whose CCTV captured the attack says they saw Masum talking to Ms Akter outside for a number of minutes before allegedly launching into a violent attack, and that they believed him to be the father of her child.

Police have already arrested a 23-year-old man on suspicion of assisting an offender and on Monday released a CCTV image of a grinning Masum boarding a buss from Bradford city centre nine minutes after the attack. He was last sighted getting off the bus in the Bradford Moor Park area, a couple of miles away.

Yesterday, Greater Manchester Police announced it had referred itself to the Independent Officer for Police Conduct due to its previous contact with Masum and Ms Akter.

Masum, who is from the city of Sylhet in eastern Bangladesh, studied for a masters in digital marketing at the University of Bedfordshire, and shares travel vlogs of his 'adventures' and life in the UK to his 14 YouTube subscribers.

A witness at a nearby fruit and veg shop in Bradford revealed the entire incident was caught on their CCTV, with footage showing a seemingly peaceful conversation being shattered by the horrific attack.

The bystander told The Sun: 'He just wanted to see his son. He has got the bus from Oldham to Bradford Interchange, then caught a taxi up here.

'He has walked up Westgate from town with the mother and baby. They have then been chatting outside the shop for about five minutes, just talking together.

'He has not tried to grab his son or anything, he just wanted to see him.'

They claim he then attacked Ms Aktar, who died at the scene.

According to another eyewitness, Ms Akter was stabbed 'four to five times' in the neck while shopping with a friend. The baby was not harmed.

Geo Khan, 69, who runs the shop, tried to resuscitate Ms Akter, who was one of his customers.

Mr Khan said he was sitting in his store on Saturday afternoon when he was alerted by screams on the other side of Westgate, in central Bradford.

He said he rushed over to Ms Akter, who was with a friend outside a convenience store on Wigan Street, and was joined by a doctor as others called the ambulance.

'I was sitting in my shop and heard screaming,' Mr Khan said on Monday. I came out and I tried to check the pulse. There was no pulse.'

He said: 'Blood was all over on the floor and there were stab wounds in her neck.'

Mr Khan said he was joined by the passing doctor who took over trying to help Ms Akter, but agreed there was no pulse.

'Him and me and another guy tried to rescue her, but she was already gone,' Mr Khan said. 'I don't think she was there any more.'

He said: 'Whatever happened, it's a very sad thing.'

Mr Khan said Ms Akter came into his shop the day before the incident, and he believes she only came to the area a few weeks ago.

He said the baby is about four or five months old. Mr Khan said he believes she is from Bangladesh.

He said: 'She was a very, very innocent person - the smile on her face.'

At a press conference on Monday, Assistant Chief Constable Damien Miller of West Yorkshire Police said the victim, Ms Akter, was from Oldham, Greater Manchester, where she had been in contact with police prior to moving to Bradford.

He added that Masum was also known to police in Greater Manchester.

'On Saturday April 6, shortly before 3.20pm Kulsuma Akter was walking in Bradford city centre,' he said.

'Kulsuma was with her young baby at this time, and was walking along Westgate when she was attacked and stabbed multiple times.

'The emergency services were called at 3.21pm. However, despite the best efforts of members of the public, ambulance crews, and hospital staff, Kulsuma sadly lost her life due to the injuries. Her baby is safe and well and was not harmed in this incident.'

Police believe that Masum is still in the country and have been carrying out house to house enquiries in the Moore Park area of the city.

Mr Miller said: 'I would encourage Masum to contact us and hand himself in immediately.

'At this stage, we have done an all ports warning, and I believe he is still in the country.

'Masum is a suspect, we have a victim who died and I would encourage everyone to contact us if they see him and do not approach him.'

West Yorkshire Police is leading the hunt for Masum, but Greater Manchester Police is also heavily involved due to Masum's links with the area.

Detective Superintendent Jude Holmes, from GMP, said: 'We share the shock and concern that our communities feel in the wake of this tragic incident, and our thoughts are with Kulsuma Akter's family at this truly distressing time.

'Habibur Masum is wanted by West Yorkshire Police on suspicion of murder. Due to his links to Greater Manchester, we have our specialist officers following several lines of enquiry to locate him.

'Due to previous police contact with Habibur Masum and Kulsuma Akter, Greater Manchester Police has made a referral to the Independent Office for Police Conduct.'

Concerns have been raised in the past over the deaths of women who have accused male partners of violent behaviour before going on to be murdered by them.

In 2017, the IOPC's predecessor body, the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC), said GMP's handling of three women who were murdered by their partners was 'unsatisfactory' but not misconduct.

A source, who described himself as a friend of Masum's, told MailOnline that he had come to the UK from Bangladesh two years ago to study

Horrific CCTV from a nearby food store shows the knifeman plunging his weapon into Ms Akter's neck. In mid-March, Masum had shared a clip in which two characters described how a man had 'lost' his bride during a walk.

Officers were seen storming a housing association property an hour's drive away in Burnley as part of their hunt for Masum at around noon on Sunday, with officers seen leading away a man and a woman.

One neighbour said: 'The riot vans pulled up and armed police jumped out. They were everywhere. A little while afterwards, a lady and an elderly gentleman were taken out of the house by police.'

Forensic officers arrived at the property in the early hours of this morning and have been seen searching the house and garden before taking away evidence in plastic bags. They also used cameras to look inside the gutters.

At the same time as the first raid, police then entered a semi-detached home in Burley after discovering Masum had links to the family living there. A witness said: 'Armed police went in first. There were a lot of police here. 'I don't think they found anything or anyone.'

Masum appears to have been trying to carve out a career as an influencer, sharing travel vlogs of his 'adventures' and life in the UK to his 14 YouTube subscribers.

One post shows him admiring the wide range of Bangladeshi made clothes in Primark before trying on a range of winter jumpers. He then films a display showing children's clothes on offer and leaves with two full bags.

In another video from January, Masum is seen filming himself walking through a housing estate as snow falls down. He warns his followers who are new to the UK not too 'stay out in the cold too long' as they could get chest problems.

He has also shared clips to his 4,300 followers on Facebook telling them how to prepare a hospital bag for 'your newborn baby'. Another showed him setting up a child's cot.

It is understood Masum is a master's student at the University of Bedfordshire studying Digital Marketing

In January, Samin's UK Visas Support Centre shared a photo of Masum's Schengen visa as a success story

Online, Masum presents an image of himself as an enthusiastic traveller who enjoys discovering new cultures.

A source, who described himself as a friend of Masum's, told MailOnline that he had come to the UK from Bangladesh two years ago to study.

He said the suspect was married, had been living in Oldham and had wanted to go travelling across Europe.

Just days ago the suspected attacker had shared a video on his YouTube channel, vlogging his trip from Manchester to Barcelona.

The wannabe influencer captured his trip from the moment he boarded the Ryanair flight to landing in the Spanish city, before encouraging his 14 subscribers to continue following for more upcoming videos.

Masum's friend, who works at the visa company that helped him get a Schengen visa to travel countries in Europe, said last night that he was 'completely shocked' by the news.

He told MailOnline: 'I know him as a friend. I am shocked, really shocked about it. I am surprised, he's a nice and good person. I can't believe the situation. He had been in the UK for nearly two years, he is studying.

'I know he's married. Two months ago he was living in Oldham, Manchester, but which area I do not know. He's a student so he wanted to go travelling and I helped him get a visa as he wanted to visit Europe.

'I know him from seeing him in local places, playing football and cricket, so I know him from that. Then he told me he wanted to go visit Europe and said he wanted to apply for a visa.

'He is a nice person from my knowledge but I have not heard from him since about two months ago. I am really shocked about this.'

In January, Samin's UK Visas Support Centre shared a photo of Masum's Schengen visa as a success story.

A photo of the suspect's visa to Portugal read: 'Happy to help you. Schengen Visa from UK. Good idea, better application visa.'

Police named Masum on Sunday and urged the public to contact them with any sightings of him.

Officers were called to the Westgate area of Bradford at 3.21pm on Saturday after reports of a woman being stabbed by a man who then fled, and she later died in hospital.

A knife was recovered from the scene of the incident.

Police described Masum as an Asian man, of slim build.

He was pictured on CCTV wearing a duffle coat with three large horizontal lines of grey, white and black, light blue or grey tracksuit bottoms with a small black emblem on the left pocket and maroon trainers.

There was no sign of any police activity in the area this morning but one bunch of flowers had been laid close to where the attack happened.

A witness also reported seeing him wearing a grey hoodie with the hood up. He is believed to have links to the Burnley and Chester areas.

Detective chief inspector Stacey Atkinson, of West Yorkshire Police's Homicide and Enquiry Team, said: 'We have had significant resources following up a number of lines of enquiry to locate Habibur Masum but at this time his whereabouts are unknown.

'A knife was recovered from the scene of the murder, but we cannot say if Habibur Masum is armed, and I would urge anyone who does see him not to approach him but to call 999 immediately.

'If anyone has any information about his movements or whereabouts since 3.20pm on Saturday please contact police as a matter of urgency.

'We understand that the murder of a young woman in such shocking circumstances has caused considerable concern in the local community. Residents can expect to continue to see a significant police presence in Bradford as we make further enquiries and conduct reassurance patrols in the area.'

In a joint statement on Sunday, Bradford City ward councillors, Aneela Ahmed, Nazam Azam and Shakeela Lal, said: 'We are deeply shocked and saddened by yesterday's incident. Our thoughts and prayers are with the family and friends of the deceased.

'We would urge anyone who has any information relating to the incident, to contact the police.'

Bradford West MP Naz Shah, whose constituency covers the city centre, described the incident as 'really shocking'.

She sent her condolences to the woman's loved ones and also urged anyone with any information to get in touch with officers.","Fugitive Bradford murder suspect Habibur Masum - wanted over fatal stabbing of mother pushing a pram - 'is the father of the baby and ex-lover of the victim', locals say",1

The magistrate concluded that the fault lied with the unnamed woman, who was 19 at the time of her injury, for having 'put herself in danger', after attending a protest, stating that she must 'bear the consequences', according to Spanish news outlet ABC.

The woman was injured during clashes in Barcelona between police and demonstrators in February 2021, who were protesting against the imprisonment of rapper Pablo Hasel.

Catalan human rights group Iridia had stated that the injury was caused by a foam-tipped projectile.

However, on Thursday Judge Joaquin Aguirre said that in the face of an 'illegal demonstration' which became 'increasingly tense', police officers were 'forced to use, with prior authorisation from the head of the operation, the rubber balls.'

Judge throws out case against a young woman who was injured while protesting against the imprisonment of musician Pablo Hasel, who was convicted in 2018 for glorifying terrorism, slander and libel after he attacked the monarchy and accused police of killing and torturing immigrants in a string of tweets

'I have spent three years waiting for this judge to give a resolution to my case and the only thing he has done is indirectly blame the victim,' said the woman in an open letter on Thursday.

She maintained that she was a victim of police violence for attending a protest.

'I was just exercising my right to demonstrate and I ended up getting mutilated.'

'The funny thing is that for the judge my mutilation is considered fair because I exposed myself to it. Does that mean that it is not safe to go out on the streets to demonstrate?', she added.

This incident came after dozens of Spanish riot police stormed Lleida University in Catalonia and arrested Hasel, who had barricaded himself inside to avoid a controversial nine-month jail sentence.

The rapper, who is known for his radical leftist views, had locked himself inside the campus in Lerida, near Barcelona with over 50 supporters the previous day.

The musician was convicted in 2018 for glorifying terrorism, slander and libel after he attacked the monarchy and accused police of killing and torturing immigrants in a string of tweets.

After a 24-hour standoff between police and the rapper, riot police officers arrested Hasel and he was escorted out of Lleida University's rectorate building.

Hasel was found in 2018 to have encouraged violence and insulted the monarchy for his lyrics and tweets, which included references to banned guerrilla groups, compared a court to Nazis and called former king Juan Carlos a mafia capo.

His case sparked demonstrations in Madrid and Barcelona with his supporters protesting against the rapper's jailing.","Spanish judge throws out case against police who blinded a woman during protest about a rapper's imprisonment, saying she 'put herself in danger' and must 'bear the consequences'",1

News of the training exercise comes just days after the anniversary of the Capitol riot and as the Justice Department announces the creation of a new 'domestic terrorism' unit to tackle what officials said is an 'elevated threat from domestic violent extremists'.

Some questioned the close timing of the events, while others went further with fears that the Biden administration is 'preparing for American Uprising'.

'Biden's military wargames fighting and killing American ""Freedom Fighters"" in guerilla (sic) warfare,' one Twitter user posted in reaction to news of the guerilla warfare training on US soil.

Another Twitter user even questioned if the government was 'trying to get troops accustomed to the idea of killing fellow Americans?'

However, the guerilla training exercise, known as Robin Sage, has actually been running every few months since the 1970s.

Young soldiers will be battling 'seasoned freedom fighters' across North Carolina counties in a two-week 'unconventional guerrilla warfare exercise' - known as Robin Sage - where they attempt to overthrow an 'illegitimate government' (Pictured: Robin Sage training in July 2019)

During Robin Sage training, young soldiers will face off against seasoned service members from units across Fort Bragg, acting as opposing forces and guerrilla freedom fighters, as well as 'specially trained' guerilla civilians.

Some social media users find the exercise concerning as the 143-year-old Posse Comitatus Act bars federal troops from participating in civilian law enforcement except when expressly authorized by law. The legislation cites military interference in civilian affairs as a threat to democracy and personal liberty.

Others have implied the exercise is preparing soldiers to prevent an insurgence and fear it is training American troops how to fight their own people.

The Robin Sage exercise, which serves as the final exam in Special Forces Qualification Course training, will begin January 22 at an undisclosed location on private land.

It places soldiers in the 'politically unstable' fictional country of Pineland and forces them to conduct reconnaissance, raids, ambushes, and numerous other operations a 'numerically superior enemy'.

'The Special Forces candidates have to meet up with and make rapport with a third-world nation guerrilla force, train them up, and then work by, with, and through that guerrilla force to conduct combat operations against a numerically superior enemy occupying force,' retired Special Forces warrant officer Steve Balestrieri, who also served as an instructor for the course, told Business Insider.

The US Army John F. Kennedy Special Warfare Center and School, which conducts the Robin Sage exercise, said teams are placed in a 'real world setting characterized by armed conflict' and presented with war-crime scenarios, such as a partner force wanting to execute a prisoner or destroy a village.

The soldiers are then tasked with negotiating the situations without violating war laws or losing the support of their allies.

Several citizens, however, are concerned the exercise encourages soldiers to target civilians

'Military members act as realistic opposing forces and guerrilla freedom fighters, also known as Pineland resistance movement,' the center told the Charlotte Observer.

'To add realism of the exercise, civilian volunteers throughout the state act as role players. Participation by these volunteers is crucial to the success of this training, and past trainees attest to the realism they add to the exercise.'

Several citizens, however, are concerned the exercise encourages soldiers to target civilians.

'Whether this is a routine exercise or not, the fact that it seems plausible that our own military is training on how to combat its own citizens is telling,' Scott M. argued in a comment on an article about the training.

'Over the past year. we've heard our very own commander in chief mock the ability of an armed citizenry to defend itself against government tyranny. That ability is foundational to our bill of rights and he seems to think it's a joke.'

'Obviously practice for civil war or domestic warfare,' echoed someone using the name James Bond. 'Hope it utterly fails.'

The training exercise (pictured in 2019) serves as the final exam in Special Forces Qualification Course training and will begin January 22 at an undisclosed location on private land

Retired Special Forces warrant officer Steve Balestrieri (pictured right), who has served as an instructor on the course, said soldiers have to 'meet up with and make rapport with a third-world nation guerrilla force, train them up, and then work by, with, and through that guerrilla force to conduct combat operations against a numerically superior enemy occupying force'

Despite the online criticisms, those familiar with the course allege the interactions between the 'team' and the 'guerrillas' could determine the success or failure of a mission on the battlefield.

John Black, a retired Green Beret, told Insider his Robin Sage infiltration was 'supposed to be brutal'.

'We had packed everything in preparation for more than two weeks in the field with no resupply. Two Blackhawk choppers dropped us off behind enemy lines where we were to meet our partner force in the middle of the night,' he explained.

'We walked and walked with this guy for hours in what seemed like a circle — he was lost. The captain asked to help him navigate with the map. Turned out we had been circling the camp for hours and the solution was simple — ask if he needed help.'

The retired service member argues the most important aspect of the training exercise is the hands-on lessons it provides about Special Forces operations and the prevention of a resistance or insurgent force taking power.

'As a Green Beret, I feel Robin Sage is imperative and really gets you to think about the real mission of Special Forces, to work with and through a partner force,' Black said.

'Very little of what a Green Beret does is kicking in doors and getting bad guys. Robin Sage definitely helped prepare me for life as an operator on a team,' he added.

Balestieri echoed Black's statements, saying: 'What makes Robin Special is how well and smoothly it's run from the time the student teams go into isolation until they [infiltrate] and are actively engaged with the G-Force.'

Robin Sage training - named after Col. Jerry Michael Sage (pictured) who was captured by Nazis and attempted to escape more than a dozen times before succeeding - has been conducted since 1974

'It rams home how important is, when operating in a guerrilla warfare/unconventional warfare environment, to at least have the nominal support of the population.'

Public notice of the 'premiere unconventional warfare exercise' became priority in 2002 after a student was killed and another injured when North Carolina sheriff's deputy mistook the exercises for criminal activity.

https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8614105/Chicago-goes-lockdown-bridges-raised-freeway-exits-closed-restrict-access-downtown.html,1,"Black Lives Matter Chicago said early Monday's looting of stores was a form of 'reparations' as the group held a protest Monday night in support of the more than 100 people arrested after an evening of violence.

Downtown Chicago was otherwise quiet after authorities cut off access, with drawbridges leading into the city pulled up and freeway exits blocked after riots sparked by a false rumor of a child shot by police.

At least 13 police officers were injured as the violence claimed an estimated $65 million in property damage.

Ariel Atkins, a BLM organizer, called the looting 'reparations'.

'I don’t care if someone decides to loot a Gucci or a Macy’s or a Nike store, because that makes sure that person eats,' Atkins said. 'That makes sure that person has clothes.

'Anything they wanted to take, they can take it because these businesses have insurance.'

Politicians, police chiefs and civic leaders were hoping for calm to return to the city on Monday, after the chaos of Sunday

The man whose actions sparked the unrest, 20-year-old Latrell Allen (pictured), was charged with attempted murder of police

Earlier, Mayor Lori Lightfoot had warned looters who ransacked the city that they are being sought by police and angrily hit back at questions over whether a failure to prosecute those involved in the looting after George Floyd's death had created a sense of impunity.

The man whose actions sparked the unrest, 20-year-old Latrell Allen, was charged with attempted murder of police.

Allen, who had previous arrests for child endangerment, domestic battery and burglary, was confronted by police on Sunday afternoon and fled, turning around and shooting multiple rounds at officers as he fled. He was shot and injured by police, returning fire, and rumor then spread that a child had been killed by officers.

Social media was soon alight with rallying cries for protests and looting.

On Monday afternoon, SWAT teams were seen patrolling the streets, in a bid to avoid a repeat of the chaos.

Cook County State Attorney Kim Foxx dropped charges against several hundred protesters arrested for looting and other offenses during the George Floyd protests.

David Brown, Chicago Police Superintendent, said at the Monday press conference that looters could have been behaving 'as if there are not consequences' because of 'what happened previously'.

A reporter, addressing the police chief, said: 'It almost sounds as though you were saying the reason we have this is the courts and the prosecutors were not doing their job, that they were going too easy on the looters from the last time around. Is that my understanding?'

Brown replied: 'Don't take it from me. Just go about what's been done. I don't want to do your job for you but go about what's been done. There were no consequences for the people arrested.'

At this point, Lightfoot stood up and addressed the reporter.

'Let's be clear,' she said. 'Don't bait us! OK? Do not bait us. Do not bait us.

'This is a serious situation. People are concerned about their safety. Officers are concerned about their safety. So don't bait us.

'What we're saying is, as a result of what happened last night, there have to be consequences.

'We've got teams of people that are aggressively out there identifying the people responsible, looking at the plates, and working on bringing them to justice.

'But when we do, and we do make those arrests, our expectation is that is going to be treated with the level of seriousness that it should be, period.'

She angrily denied that Foxx's decision, or any other ruling by the Chicago authorities, contributed towards the unrest.

'Don't try to bait us, mischaracterize, pit one against the other,' she said.

'We're not playing that. We're in a serious situation here, and we need a serious response. That's what we're saying, period.'

Mayor Lori Lightfoot and Chicago Police Supt. David Brown held a news conference Monday morning, condemning the riots

The tense stand-off that lasted several hours on Sunday night and in to Monday morning was described by Deputy Police Chief Yolanda Talley as 'very hostile'.

In response to that incident, people on social media organized for a caravan of cars to descend on the city's downtown shopping district to loot.

Police found out about the posts and within 15 minutes were downtown - but the violence had begun.

Cars plowed through storefronts to give the crowds easy access.

Despite there being 400 officers dispatched to the area, the officers struggled to keep up with the crowds.

One officer was attacked with a bottle, another had his nose broken and a group of different officers were shot at by drive-by assailants while trying to arrest other looters.

Along the Magnificent Mile, people were seen going in and out of stores carrying shopping bags full of merchandise as well as at a bank, the Chicago Tribune reported, and as the crowd grew vehicles dropped off more people in the area.

One officer was seen slumped against a building, several arrests were made and a rock was thrown at a police vehicle, the newspaper said.

Police worked early Monday to disperse the crowds.

There was a large police presence Monday morning outside an Apple store located north of Chicago's downtown area.

Blocks away, debris was strewn in parking lots in front of a Best Buy and a large liquor store.

Train and bus service into downtown was temporarily suspended at the request of public safety officials, the Chicago Transit Authority said on Twitter.

Bridges over the Chicago River were lifted, preventing travel to and from the downtown area, and Illinois State Police blocked some expressway ramps into downtown.

On Monday morning, police were still arresting people at a Best Buy which was among the stores that had been ransacked.

Some of the city's bridges were raised and tunnels were closed while police tried to regain control of the situation.

MAYOR LIGHTFOOT'S REMARKS: 'THERE IS NO EXCUSE' Mayor Lori Lightfoot on Monday called the chaos 'straight up felony activity' Mayor Lori Lightfoot warned the looters in Sunday's chaos that they would be found and that a special task force was being put together to sift through the city's expansive surveillance camera footage. 'Let's be clear. We are coming for you. We are already at work finding you. 'I don't care - I do not care - whatever justification was given for this. 'There is no justification for criminal behavior ever. You have no right to take and destroy the property of others. 'Our residents deserve to be safe.. Our businesses deserve to understand and enjoy safety and security,' she said. She pleaded with prosecutors and the courts to do their part to bring those responsible to justice once they are found and identified. 'Our police officers deserve to be able to do their job without having to worry about shots being fired, being maced- this is not anywhere near acceptable. 'I call upon our state's attorney and our courts to make sure these individuals are arrested and held accountable. 'Put your best people on this. We have made the case - these people need to be held accountable. 'We can't continue to allow this to happen,' she said. Advertisement

Lightfoot said it was disturbing that the looters targeted small businesses that are still struggling to recover from months of COVID-19 closures.

'This was an assault on our city. It undermines public safety and breathes a sense of insecurity among our residents.

'It undermines our recovery efforts - these same stores were hit previously, not just by looting but by closures related to COVID-19.

'They are also small stores and restaurants all of which we're in the process of recovering and getting back to work, and now this.'

She said there was 'no justification' for the looting, and said it had nothing to do with Black Lives Matter, or George Floyd, or Michael Brown - the Missouri teenager shot dead six years ago Sunday.

'I don't care - I do not care - whatever justification was given for this,' she said.

'There is no justification for criminal behavior ever.

'You have no right to take and destroy the property of others.

'Our residents deserve to be safe.

'Our businesses deserve to understand and enjoy safety and security,' she said.

She pleaded with prosecutors and the courts to do their part to bring those responsible to justice once they are found and identified.

'Our police officers deserve to be able to do their job without having to worry about shots being fired, being maced - this is not anywhere near acceptable.

'I call upon our state's attorney and our courts to make sure these individuals are arrested and held accountable.

'Put your best people on this. We have made the case - these people need to be held accountable. 'We can't continue to allow this to happen,' she said.

'We woke up in shock this morning. These individuals engaged in brazen destruction.

'This had nothing to do with legitimate protected First Amendment speech. Regardless what occurred in our downtown was abject criminal behavior, pure and simple.

'There cannot be any excuse for it. Period.

'This was not legitimate First Amendment speech, not poor people engaged in petty theft to feed themselves and their families...

'This was straight up felony criminal conduct,' she said.

It was one of a handful of incidents of unrest across America that coincided with the sixth anniversary of Michael Brown's death.

https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-9921943/New-Zealand-sees-highest-increase-Covid-April-2020-day-unfathomable-lockdown.html,1,"New Zealand has recorded its highest increase in Covid cases since April 2020, just a day after Jacinda Ardern extended the country's draconian lockdown in a move branded 'absurd' by Australia's prime minister.

Infections grew by 41 on Tuesday, taking the total infections in the recent outbreak to 148, with health officials already warning the Delta variant would be like dealing with a whole new virus.

Ardern was slammed for the 'unfathomable' decision to extend the harsh lockdown on Monday in response to the rising cases, which has led to a total of eight people being hospitalised.

Critics said the strategy of trying to totally eradicate the virus through lockdown measures was always destined to fail when confronted with the more contagious Delta variant, particularly with the slow vaccination rollout in New Zealand.

Australian PM Scott Morrison, who has presided over similarly harsh lockdowns in response to relatively few cases, told the 9News breakfast show: 'Any state and territory that thinks that somehow they can protect themselves from Covid with the Delta strain forever, that's just absurd.

'I mean, New Zealand can't do that. They were following an elimination strategy. They're in lockdown. The way through is to get to those 70 per cent and 80 per cent (vaccination) marks and open safely.'

New Zealand's nation's virus-free run since February ended last week after the outbreak of the Delta variant erupted in Auckland. The nation on Tuesday recorded its highest increase in COVID-19 cases since April 2020

An outbreak was recorded in Sydney over the weekend as cases grew by more than 800, near record levels. Health authorities said Monday an outbreak centred in Melbourne also grew by 71 cases and another in the capital, Canberra, grew by 16 cases.

On Monday, Jacinda Ardern extended New Zealand's harsh level 4 lockdown until at least Friday, and until the end of the month in Auckland

The South Pacific nation's virus-free run since February ended last week after an outbreak of the Delta variant erupted in Auckland, New Zealand's largest city, and quickly spread to the capital Wellington.

The health ministry said a cluster of at least 58 people of Samoan ethnicity linked to the Samoan Assembly Of God Church in Auckland were among the infected, and that the community had received racist messages via social media.

'The virus is the problem, not people,' the ministry said on Twitter.

Director General of Health Ashley Bloomfield said: 'Delta is unlike our previous experience. It is, as we know, highly infectious and transmissible and, as we have seen, spreads rapidly.'

Jacinda Ardern had garnered global praise for stamping out Covid in the country, but her reliance on strict border controls and snap lockdowns has been called into question amid the latest outbreak, which has occurred while only 20 per cent of the population has been vaccinated.

Opposition leader Judith Collins on Monday said: 'At a time when New Zealanders have the harshest lockdown in the world and have lost our freedoms because of the government's failure to vaccinate and secure the border, [the lockdown extension] by Jacinda Ardern is unfathomable.'

Though most of the country will remain in level 4 lockdown until Friday 27 August, Auckland is destined to stay fully locked down until the end of the month

Scott Morrison declared on Monday that Australian states must open their borders once vaccination rates reach 80 per cent of the population aged 16 years and older.

But in Western Australia, where there are no community infections, premier Mark McGowan said his government would not reopen at the 80 per cent vaccination level if it meant reintroducing the virus.

Around 24 per cent of Australians are fully vaccinated.

Prime Minister Morrison's remarks came following an outbreak in Sydney over the weekend as cases grew by more than 800, near record levels.

Health authorities said an outbreak centred in Melbourne also grew by 71 cases and another in the capital, Canberra, grew by 16 cases.

All three cities remain in lockdown despite widespread protests which have left a number of police officers injured in violent clashes with protestors.

Violence erupted when police attempted to control protesters with pepper spray during the Freedom protest on August 21, 2021 in Melbourne, Australia

Police used tear gas, pepper spray and rubber bullets on demonstrators in Melbourne and arrested more than 200 people after an anti-lockdown rally on Saturday descended into a riot.

More than 4,000 people turned up to the 'freedom rally' in the Australian city on Saturday morning, and by late afternoon six officers has been hospitalised - including two with suspected broken noses, one with a broken thumb and the others with concussions - and 218 protesters arrested.

Police issued 236 fines for breaching coronavirus restrictions, and have three people in custody for assaulting police.

https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jan/09/israel-security-minister-bans-palestinian-flag-flying-in-public,1,"Israel’s national security minister has ordered police to ban Palestinian flags from public places in the latest crackdown by the country’s new hardline government.

Itamar Ben-Gvir’s order follows a series of other punitive steps against the Palestinians since taking office late last month.

“Today I directed the Israel police to enforce the prohibition of flying any PLO flag that shows identification with a terrorist organization from the public sphere and to stop any incitement against the State of Israel,” Ben-Gvir announced on Twitter.

Benjamin Netanyahu’s new government has moved quickly against the Palestinians in retaliation for a Palestinian push for the UN’s highest judicial body to give its opinion on Israel’s 55-year military occupation of the West Bank.

It has withheld nearly $40m (£32.9m) in Palestinian tax revenues and said it would transfer the money to victims of Palestinian militant attacks, stripped Palestinian officials of VIP privileges and even broke up a meeting of Palestinian parents discussing their children’s education, claiming it was unlawfully funded by the Palestinian Authority.

Ben-Gvir, a far-right firebrand known for his anti-Arab rhetoric, drew widespread international condemnation when he visited Jerusalem’s most sensitive holy site last week.

The repeated moves have the potential to increase tensions after the deadliest year of the Israel-Palestinian conflict in nearly two decades, according to a report by the Israeli rights group B’Tselem.

Ben-Gvir’s latest order is not the first battle over flying the Palestinian flag.

The red, green and white Palestinian flag carries great symbolism in the Israel-Palestinian conflict. Last May, Israeli riot police beat pallbearers at the funeral for the Al Jazeera journalist Shireen Abu Akleh, who had been shot while covering a military raid in the Jenin refugee camp. Police ripped Palestinian flags out of people’s hands and fired stun grenades to disperse the crowd.

Israel once considered the Palestinian flag that of a militant group akin to the Palestinian Hamas or the Lebanese Shia Hezbollah. But after Israel and the Palestinians signed a series of interim peace agreements known as the Oslo accords, the flag was recognised as that of the Palestinian Authority, which was created to administer Gaza and parts of the occupied West Bank. Israel opposes any official business being carried out by the PA in East Jerusalem, and police have in the past broken up events they alleged were linked to the PA.

Netanyahu told his cabinet on Sunday the measures against the Palestinians were aimed at what he called “an extreme anti-Israel” step at the UN.

Israel’s Palestinian citizens make up 20% of the population and they’ve had a turbulent relationship with the state since its creation in 1948, when hundreds of thousands of Palestinians fled or were forced to flee in the events surrounding the establishment of the state of Israel.

Those who remained became citizens, but have long been viewed with suspicion by some Israelis because of their ties to Palestinians in the West Bank, Gaza Strip and East Jerusalem, territories Israel captured in the six-day war of 1967.

The Palestinians seek all three areas for a future independent state. Netanyahu’s new government is dominated by hardliners who oppose Palestinian statehood.",Israel security minister bans Palestinian flag-flying in public,1
https://www.theguardian.com/society/2024/apr/24/tommy-nicol-kind-friendly-beloved-brother-died-prison-99-year-sentence,1,"When Tommy Nicol told his sister Donna Mooney about his prison sentence, she didn’t believe him. It was May 2009 and he had stolen yet another car. Nicol was a petty criminal, always nicking motors, and was rarely out of jail. “He said: ‘They’ve given me a 99-year sentence.’ I said: ‘That’s ridiculous.’ I thought he was confused.” Over the next few years, Nicol occasionally mentioned the sentence in letters to Mooney and asked her to look into it. She admits she didn’t give it much thought at the time.

In 2015, Nicol killed himself in prison. He was 37. It was only then that Mooney discovered he had been right all along. Nicol had a four-year tariff (the minimum amount of time he could serve in jail) and an indeterminate sentence, known as imprisonment for public protection. IPP is also called a 99-year sentence because people serving one can, technically, be jailed for 99 years. When they are released, it is on a 99-year licence, which means they can be recalled to prison at any time in their life for even minor breaches, such as being late for a probation appointment (although the Parole Board will consider whether to terminate the licence 10 years after first release).

IPP was introduced in England and Wales by Labour in the Criminal Justice Act 2003 and first used in 2005 to protect the public from serious offenders whose crimes did not merit a mandatory life sentence. IPP was abolished in 2012 because it was regarded as a breach of human rights, but it was not abolished retrospectively. There are still 2,852 people in prison serving IPP sentences. Many of them now have severe mental health problems and have lost hope because they don’t know when, or if, they will be released. In the 19 years since IPP was introduced, 90 prisoners serving the sentence are known to have killed themselves. A 2020 study by the Prison Reform Trust found that IPP prisoners were two and a half times more likely to harm themselves than others in the prison population.

Mooney lives with her husband and two boys in a stylish, modern house, but asks me not to disclose the location because she has been attacked in the past for her campaigning. She looks around and says it couldn’t be more different from her and Nicol’s childhood. Her husband, a marketing executive, has done well for himself. As has she. Mooney taught nursery and primary schoolchildren before becoming an education adviser and academic.

Nicol and Mooney grew up in a chaotic household in London. Their mother had six children and, Mooney says, terrible taste in men, who were unreliable at best. Her and Nicol’s father was from Saudi Arabia and left their mother when she was pregnant with Mooney. As a family, they stood out: “We were all different colours. Me and Tommy are brown, we have a white sister and the dads of my two younger brothers and sister are Jamaican.” They moved from home to home, sometimes living in refuges, escaping the violent men in their mother’s life.

Nicol was the eldest of the children by 18 months and Mooney the second eldest. They couldn’t have been closer as kids. She remembers talking to him through the fence that separated her nursery from his primary school. He taught her to ride a bike by taking her to a multistorey car park. “I was scared. Petrified. He took me up the ramp and held the back of the bike and cheered me on. ‘You can do it!’ He let go and ran beside me and I managed to do it. He was always like that. Pushing you. He’s a champion.” She still sometimes talks of Nicol in the present tense.

Nicol was always climbing on and jumping off things he shouldn’t have. “Tommy loved being outside and we had a lot of freedom.” He was popular, she says. “Super-friendly, chatty, kind. He loved girls. He was a handsome lad. My friends used to say: ‘He’s so fit,’ and I’d be like: ‘He’s my brother, puhlease!’”

‘Super-friendly, chatty, kind’ … a young Tommy Nicol.

Mooney was more cautious and introverted. While she did well academically, Nicol struggled with school work. (As an adult, he was diagnosed with dyslexia.) “If he was asked to read, he couldn’t, so he’d just kick out. He’d get into trouble, being mouthy to the teacher. He climbed to the top of this high fence at primary school one day, took his top off and was shouting at the teacher. He was expelled from endless schools.”

Nicol was sent to a specialist school for pupils who had been expelled, but he didn’t last long there, either. He started to hang around with older boys. By the time he was 14, he was stealing cars. He did it for a buzz, Mooney says. He certainly never made any money from it – he didn’t even sell the cars on. After a period in care, he was sent to a secure training centre. Soon after his release, he and a few older friends robbed a shop. Nicol was the only one who got caught and he refused to tell the police who else was involved. By the time he was 16, he was serving a sentence at Feltham young offender institution in west London.

Whenever Mooney visited her brother, he appeared to be doing fine. “Tommy always seemed quite chirpy. Except for one letter, he never showed any vulnerability or revealed what he was dealing with. But it was really hard for him. I didn’t realise how hard it was till after the inquest.” Nicol attempted suicide as a teenager at Feltham, but Mooney learned this only recently.

After his release from Feltham, Nicol was recalled – this time for a fight in a pub. He was sent to an adult prison. His life began to follow the same pattern: prison, a few weeks of freedom, another recall. Mooney reckons that, until his IPP sentence, the longest Nicol spent free was three months.

When he was out, he would nearly always visit his sister, often staying with her. They talked about the possibility of him keeping out of trouble and getting a job. “He wanted to be a mechanic,” Mooney says, laughing. “He probably would have been really good at it. He was good at taking things apart and putting them back together.” Does she think he was capable of putting his life back together? “One hundred per cent. Look at countries like Sweden and Finland. Their reoffending rates are so low because they care about people. They help to fix them early.”

She thinks about the life Nicol could have led. “That’s what makes me so angry. The education system, the prison system; it’s all geared towards damaging the most damaged.”

Her brother never received support, she says. “We’d have the conversation all the time. He’d say: ‘I want to come out, get a job, have a family,’ but he didn’t know how to get there. He’d come out, get overwhelmed, make really bad decisions and do stupid things.” Just think, Mooney says, if the money spent on incarcerating her brother had been used for therapy, to prepare him for the outside world and to support him once he was free.

The only time she didn’t see Nicol was on his final release in 2009. Mooney doesn’t know why he didn’t get in touch with her; it haunts her. But she does know about his last hours as a free man. Typically, it involved a stolen car. This time, though, he didn’t take it for a joyride. Nicol was living in the approved premises that prisoners are allocated when they come out on parole. If he had got back to the hostel late, he would have breached his licence. That night, he was running late. Terrified he would be recalled to prison again, he saw a car in a garage and nicked it to get himself back in time. Mooney laughs. “I know! It doesn’t make sense. You’re going to get recalled anyway, because you’ve stolen a car.” Logic wasn’t Tommy’s strong point, she says.

Nicol with Mooney.

The man in the garage tried to stop Nicol and was hurt in the tussle. Nicol was charged with robbery, attempted robbery and possession of an offensive weapon (the victim said he had a knife, which Nicol denied). He received an IPP.

While Nicol’s life was careering out of control, Mooney’s was going better than she had ever imagined. She had moved with her husband to New York for his work. She had got a great job, lecturing in early-years education at City University in Manhattan. “It was amazing,” she says. “I never thought I’d be living a life like that.” She lurches to a stop. “But none of that matters when someone you love dies.”

For the first time, she became distant from Tommy. She wrote to him in prison, he called her occasionally, but she didn’t see him during his IPP sentence. Mooney wonders whether he would still be alive if she had been nearby. “How could I not feel like that?” she says. “I was the closest person to him and in a country so far away. If we’d been here, would he have let us know that he was having such a hard time? Would I have visited him? Probably. Would it have made a difference? Maybe. When someone dies by suicide, you run those things through your head.”

Nine years on from Nicol’s death, the voices haven’t quietened. “Why didn’t I read up about the IPP? Why didn’t I fight for him more?” Nicol was rarely in touch with his mother or other siblings. “He had no one. I was the only person and I wasn’t there when he needed me.” She starts to cry.

In September 2015, Mooney was in New York when she experienced an extreme, inexplicable anxiety. “I was travelling with my husband and my son and I remember having this feeling of dread. I kept waking up in the night.” She sniffs back her tears. “I’ve never had anything like that before. That was the week when everything was happening with Tommy. And part of me wonders if it was connected in some way.”

The following week, the prison told her family that Nicol had killed himself. Mooney was broken. “I didn’t believe it ... He’d been through such terrible things in his life and he’s so strong. I was like: ‘He would never do that.’ I felt ruined.”

Mooney demanded information from the Mount, the prison in Hertfordshire where he died. “I went into this spiral. I was in America trying to find out where his body was and what happened to him. Nobody would tell us anything.” A week later, she returned to England to organise the funeral. “I went straight to the hospital to see Tommy’s body. I just wanted to see him.”

After Mooney returned to New York, she kept trying to find out what happened to her brother. She started researching IPP and was shocked by what she found. The sentence had been abolished three years earlier, yet Nicol was still in jail serving one. He was the 67th man to have killed himself while serving an IPP sentence in the 10 years they had been employed. The name of the sentence made no sense to her, either. The only person Nicol presented a serious threat to was himself.

Mooney made contact with others affected by IPP sentences. She discovered that many of those who had survived IPP ended up with severe mental health problems. Ironically, many were being refused parole because their mental health was too poor.

But Mooney was yet to discover the worst: what had happened to Nicol in his final weeks.

When IPP was abolished in 2012, the justice secretary, Ken Clarke, called the sentence a “stain” on the criminal justice system. He admitted it was “almost impossible” for prisoners to prove that they were no longer a risk to the public – a requirement for release. When IPP was introduced, the government predicted that only 900 people would serve the sentence at any one time; when it was abolished, that figure was 6,000. In total 8,711 people were given the sentence. Of those, just 249 were women.

In 2014, David Blunkett, who introduced IPP when he was home secretary, said the government had “got the implementation wrong”. In 2021, Blunkett acknowledged two major flaws in IPP. First, resources were not put in place to ensure that the courses and therapies prisoners needed to prove they were fit for release were available. It had often been impossible for prisoners to complete the required courses and therapies. Second, Blunkett said, recall provisions were “made more draconian”, resulting in those on IPP sentences being recalled for trivial breaches of licence.

Blunkett noted that out of the 3,000 people then still in prison on IPP, 1,300 of them were there because of recalls – an increase of 100% from 2016. He said: “If we are not careful, that trajectory will lead to more prisoners being in prison on IPP on recall than are actually in prison for the original IPP sentence applied, which is a farcical situation and a tragedy for them.” That tragedy has now come to pass. At the end of last year, of the 2,852 people serving IPP sentences; 1,625 had been recalled and 1,227 had never been released.

Perhaps the biggest flaw of all was devising IPP in the first place. How could an indefinite sentence for these kind of crimes ever have been just? How could the very nature of it not destroy the hope or sanity of people such as Nicol?

Mooney struggled hugely after her brother’s death: “I was trying to get up and function, I had a two-year-old I was trying to give a stable life to, and I couldn’t even walk down the street without crying.” Over time, she learned more about Nicol’s final weeks. “I’d go through everything, pull out inaccuracies and contradictions. I thought this must be happening to other people. So I started looking at the suicides. I went through every report on anyone who’d died on an IPP.”

She discovered the whole truth only after Nicol’s inquest – three years after his death. Nicol had been a model prisoner in several prisons for the four years up to his tariff. “He was working in the kitchens, he didn’t take any drugs … He was compliant, trying to engage, and he spent four years trying to get on these frigging courses.”

After the four years, Nicol was refused parole because – like so many other IPP prisoners – he had failed to get on the courses he needed to complete to be released. “He was dyslexic. He wrote off to one and they said you haven’t got enough information on your form, you can’t come here.” (Ministry of Justice figures for the year to March 2020 show that 57% of prisoners had English and maths levels at or below those expected of an 11-year-old.) Did he get any help to fill in the forms? Mooney shakes her head. “They lost his files for another course. He kept asking them to check the files had gone in. He found out a year later they’d lost them.”

Time and again, he got turned down. He was told he was unsuitable because he had no insight into his aggression, because he had not taken full responsibility for his offences, because he needed a psychological assessment. He repeatedly voiced his frustration that he had been unable to take part in offending behaviour programmes, because he knew this meant he would never be released.

Another two years passed in which he applied unsuccessfully for the courses he needed to complete. Nicol had been in prison for six years, two years beyond his tariff, when the Parole Board turned him down again in June 2015. It was a devastating blow. What’s more, he wasn’t even going to be transferred from Erlestoke prison in Wiltshire to an open prison, which would get him ready for resettlement outside. Nicol was so beside himself that he hit his head repeatedly against the cell door.

Because of this, he was moved to the segregation unit, where he spent three months. He went on two hunger strikes: one for five days, the other for seven.

In those three months in segregation at Erlestoke, Nicol’s mental health deteriorated drastically. According to the report into his death by the prisons and probation ombudsman (PPO), “Nicol had been shouting that he would save other prisoners once he was released. This had kept other prisoners awake during the night.”

He was sent to the Mount, his final prison. Nicol was initially put in a shared cell and complained that he was entitled to a single cell. For this, he received an adjudication (a warning for breaching prison discipline), even though he was proved correct and duly moved. “They didn’t know anything about him,” says Mooney. “Nothing was flagged that he’d been in segregation for three months and had gone on hunger strike.” He then cut his face with a razor blade and set fire to his cell. Prison officers claimed he threatened them.

He was put in segregation again. His mental health got even worse. He drew a circle in his own blood and sat in it, rocking, with a paper plate on his face that he was wearing as a mask. Staff reported that it was odd behaviour, but no action was taken. He should have had a mental health assessment within 24 hours of being put in segregation, but it was Friday and the staff trained to do it had gone home for the weekend. In the week he spent at the Mount, he was never assessed once.

Prison officers claimed Nicol had a weapon. Mooney says they were referring to a radio aerial and the broken frame of his glasses that he was using to cut himself. “So you know what they did?” Mooney is so distraught that she can barely talk. “Six prison officers dressed in riot gear go in the cell. I saw the video at the inquest. He’s in the cell, rocking on the floor, and they tell him to get to the back of the cell. He stands up and all these guys run in with their shields and shove him to the back and then they restrain him.”

Nicol was strip-searched and moved to an unfurnished cell. “There was nothing in there but a mattress and a paper pot,” Mooney says. “He’s having a mental health crisis and they put him on the floor and one of the prison guards says to him: ‘You can come out when you behave yourself.’” The inquest heard that Nicol hit his head repeatedly against the cell door, stamped on his own fingers and tried to gouge out his eyes. He was left there for more than 24 hours. Although ACCTs (the care planning process for prisoners identified as being at risk of suicide or self-harm) were carried out by officers, the mental health team was still not involved.

On the final day of his life, the mental health team asked to assess Nicol three times, but officers refused. The PPO report states that when the mental health team leader went to see Nicol, “staff said that his risk was too high for her to speak to him or even observe him through the cell door”. This was despite the team leader saying she could not rule out an acute psychotic illness and a nurse being allowed to check his injured finger.

At about 8.45pm, an officer checked Nicol, who showed him cuts on his head. The officer tried to talk to him but said he was incoherent. His colleague rang the communications room and asked the night manager to come to the segregation unit because Nicol had self-harmed. Both officers returned to the cell to find Nicol with a towel wrapped around his head, refusing to speak. They were satisfied that it was not an emergency and told the night manager there was no need to attend immediately. At about 8.57pm, one of the officers checked on Nicol. He had hanged himself.

Nicol died three days later at Watford general hospital. After his death, Mooney asked the prison for two things: information about what had happened to her brother and the return of his possessions. She was told that the chaplain would get back to her with the answers. “We’re still waiting for that call,” she says. She was sent his black glasses case, a tobacco tin and a lighter. “I said: ‘Is that all he had?’ and they said yes. My sister then got a box of his stuff about three months later. It was wet and mouldy and turned up out of the blue. That was horrendously traumatising for her.”

The inquest was held at Hatfield coroner’s court in November 2018. It heard evidence from Dr Dinesh Maganty, a consultant forensic psychiatrist, who described Nicol’s risk level on the day of his death as the highest it could be. He referred to a “perfect storm of risk factors” including his IPP sentence. He said that in the absence of any mental health care or support, Nicol should, at a minimum, have been placed on constant observation, which could have saved his life.

In January 2015, eight months before he died, Nicol had made a complaint to the prison authorities in which he described his inability to progress towards release as the “psychological torture of a person who is doing 99 years”. Maganty said that the IPP sentence had contributed to Nicol’s death “more than anything else”, as it had made him “lose hope”.

Donna Mooney never wanted to be a campaigner. There are things she is passionate about – education, social deprivation, prison. But she never saw herself as the type of person who would sit on panels or stand on podiums, as she has done in recent years. The thing she had in her favour was the thing she least wanted – a devastating personal story that exemplified the inhumanity of IPP and the failings of the prison system: “I was just angry. I was so angry.”

She is just as angry today. Dominic Raab’s response to the justice select committee’s report on IPP in 2023 made her furious. “He referred to the sentence as ‘unsettling’,” she says. “My brother’s dead. That’s not unsettling. I’m never going to see my brother again, never going to hear his voice, never going to be able to hug him or share those memories we have. That’s not unsettling, that’s shit.” She comes to a stop and mops away more tears. “And I’m just one person. This has happened to loads of other people. So, ‘unsettling’ is insulting.”

Three years ago, Mooney co-founded Ungripp (United Group for Reform of IPP), a campaigning and awareness group that fights for IPP prisoners to be resentenced. As well as championing change, it offers, via its website, an opportunity for IPP prisoners to tell their stories in the safety of anonymity. There are more than 200 submissions. One, from John H at HMP Hull, is the lyrics to a rap he has written called Death Sentence:

I’d rather grow old sitting on death row

Awaiting the lethal injection

Instead of this barbaric ‘no hope’ sentence

In 2020, Nicol’s family received undisclosed damages from the Ministry of Justice after beginning a civil claim in the high court. They argued that the absence of a maximum term led directly to Nicol’s death and that the administration of the sentence constituted a breach of his right to life under the Human Rights Act 1998.

In 2022, nine prisoners serving IPP sentences killed themselves – the highest number of self-inflicted deaths by prisoners since the sentence was introduced. Last year, the prisons and probation ombudsman, Adrian Usher, published a bulletin that said: “A prisoner’s IPP status should be considered as a potential risk factor for suicide and self-harm.” Usher revealed that of the 19 self-inflicted IPP deaths reviewed for the bulletin, only five of the individuals had been placed on an ACCT.

In August 2023, Alice Jill Edwards, the UN’s special rapporteur on torture, wrote to the government asking how the IPP sentencing system is compatible with its “human rights obligations and, in particular, the absolute prohibition on torture and other cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment or punishment”. Like Mooney, she has called for the resentencing of IPP prisoners: “IPP sentences were abandoned more than a decade ago. There can be no justification for the continued indefinite detention of so many individuals, often for relatively minor crimes.”

In March, the House of Lords voted through a series of amendments to the victims and prisoners bill that would help IPP prisoners, but resentencing was not backed by either Conservative or Labour. “There are no votes in releasing people from prison,” Mooney says.

I ask Mooney whether her work with Ungripp is helping her or making life harder. “I retraumatise myself every time I talk about Tommy. I think about a time when I’ll not be doing it any more and I can just grieve for my brother.” I hear her talking on the phone to one man who has been in prison for 18 years for attempting to steal a cigarette. He seems to have lost hope, just as Nicol did, and now has terrible mental health problems. He is one of four IPP prisoners who calls her a number of times a week. If you didn’t know better, you would think she was talking to her brother.

In a way, perhaps she is. “I just wish I’d been able to do this for Tommy,” Mooney says. “I didn’t. It’s never going to change what happened, it’s never going to bring him back …” She trails off. “It’s a bit screwed up, but if I can do this to stop someone else killing themselves, then I will.”

https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-9193177/Nancy-Pelosis-laptop-Capitol-siege.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490,1,"Nancy Pelosi's laptop which was stolen during the Capitol siege has not yet been recovered, a lawyer has revealed.

Prosecutors say Speaker Pelosi's HP computer was lifted from her office by 22-year-old Trump fan Riley Williams during the deadly riot on January 6.

But Williams' lawyer said Tuesday that searches of her client's home and car in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, had not yielded the laptop.

It was Williams' ex-boyfriend who alerted the FBI that there was footage of her stealing the device. He claimed Williams tried to flog it to Russian spies.

Riley Williams, 22, in a brown trench coat and glasses, was seen inside the Capitol on January 6

Williams has been out on bail since Thursday and is confined to her mother's apartment

Prosecutors have published this still from a video which they believe was taken from Williams' phone

She 'intended to send the computer device to a friend in Russia, who then planned to sell the device to SVR, Russia's foreign intelligence service,' court papers said.

Assistant U.S. Attorney Mona Sedky said during a hearing in Washington yesterday that she was reluctant to say more about what she described as an ongoing and fluid investigation.

'I'm very uncomfortable discussing the facts of the case at this stage,' Sedky said. 'I'm concerned that talking about what we do and don't know and what we're running down could jeopardize the investigation.'

Williams was arrested last Monday

Williams is on house arrest and wearing an electronic tag while she awaits trial for aiding and abetting theft, along with obstruction, trespassing and violent entry and disorderly conduct on Capitol grounds.

Sedky told the judge there is evidence Williams has directed others to delete data after the attack.

U.S. Magistrate Judge Zia M. Faruqui restricted Williams' internet access while she awaits trial.

Her lawyers say the ex-boyfriend's claims about Williams hoping to sell the laptop to Russian intelligence are overstated.

Williams was arrested in Pennsylvania last Monday.

The care worker had traveled to the Trump rally with her father from.

Williams became separated from her father and the pair didn't reunite until the evening for the journey home.

Documents filed by the prosecution include a screenshot of a four-second video found on a cell phone, which they obtained last week.

In the clip, prosecutors say, the person holding the cell phone camera is standing, angling the camera down toward a wooden desk with an HP laptop. Prosecutors believe Williams is holding the phone.

The FBI special agent investigating Williams' case said that the voiceover for the clip matched that of Williams, as seen in footage from Britain's ITV News.

The agent stated: 'A female voice that I believe to be WILLIAMS' based on my review of the ITV YouTube video described above can be heard saying, 'Dude, put on gloves.'

Williams, seen leaving the Dauphin County Prison on Thursday with attorney Bryan McQuillan, allegedly wanted to sell Pelosi's laptop to the Russians

Investigators with the FBI said that Williams was clearly identifiable at the riots on January 6

'Next, what appears to be a man's arm then reaches toward the laptop, with a black glove covering his hand, and begins to lift the laptop off the table.

'There is text across the video clip that reads: 'they got the laptop.''

Messages which prosecutors say were from Williams read: 'I stole s*** from Nancy Polesi (sic).'

Another read: 'I domt care I took Nancy Polesis hard drives I dont care kill me.'

Pelosi's deputy chief of staff, Drew Hammill, tweeted two days after the attack that a laptop stolen was from a conference room that was used for presentations.

In video footage captured by ITV, Williams can be seen inside the Capitol, wearing a green T-shirt and brown trench coat, holding a zebra-print bag

In the clip she is heard repeatedly yelling: 'Upstairs, upstairs, upstairs,' and can be seen physically directing other intruders to proceed up a staircase.

She had traveled to Washington DC with her father from her Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, home

Williams became increasingly supportive of Trump and posed with a rifle on social media

The staircase in question leads to the office of Pelosi, the FBI said.

Her mother told police that she recognized her daughter in the video footage inside the Capitol and that her daughter had recently taken a sudden interest in Trump's politics and 'far-right message boards.'

Prior to her capture, the FBI said that Williams has changed her phone number and deleted her accounts on Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Reddit, Telegram and Parler.

That’s when he then pounced on the 29-year-old parents, leaving injuries on the woman's neck and ear.

The teen's riot continued as he strangled an 82-year-old woman down the street, breaking both of her arms.

Several witnesses called 911 to try to stop him.

'I heard someone screaming, a woman screaming,' a resident at the nearby Hawthorne Apartments told FOX 8.

'When I looked out the window, I saw the woman, and she was held and restrained by a man.'

McGee choked her for more than a minute, police said. A frantic chase ensued that ended when he was taken into custody.

The 19-year-old told police, 'I broke her neck,' as he was led to a squad car. The confession was reportedly captured on an officer’s body camera.

Jim Whyte, executive director of the Central West End Neighborhood Security Initiative, says the organization's cameras captured parts of the string of attacks

Police characterized the rampage as a series of 'random attacks.'

McGee lives in the 2900 block of Heatherton Drive in unincorporated north St. Louis County.

He faces charges including assault, kidnapping, endangering the welfare of a child, armed criminal action and resisting arrest. A judge ordered McGee to be held without bond.

He also faces charges in several other incidents earlier this month, including striking a woman in the face and spitting on a police officer.

In the first case, police said McGee was caught looking for unlocked cars by the St. Louis Galleria on October 12.

He then spit on an off-duty officer who was working security.

The teen was accused of punching a Washington University student three days later when he walked past her in the city of Clayton.

He fled but was eventually arrested and charged with fourth-degree assault - a misdemeanor - and resisting arrest.

On October 25, just two weeks later, he is accused of spitting on another police officer.

A summons was issued for McGee to come to St. Louis County court on November 21.

Jim Whyte, executive director of the Central West End Neighborhood Security Initiative, said some of the organization's 275 surveillance cameras caught parts of the attacks, including the attempted baby snatching.

McGee is no stranger, according to Whyte.

'We had some brief dealings with him on a previous incident,' Whyte told the St. Louis-Post Dispatch.

McGee is believed to be homeless, and White said their homeless outreach team has engaged with him on several occasions.","Horrific moment St Louis man, 19, tries to steal baby from woman's arms at crosswalk, before breaking 82 year-old woman's arms during rampage targeting strangers",1
https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11164783/Trump-claims-FBI-threw-documents-floor-pretended-him.html,1,"Donald Trump has claimed the FBI agents were responsible for throwing classified documents on the floor of Mar-a-Lago - and said they were 'perhaps pretending it was me who did it'.

'Terrible the way the FBI, during the Raid of Mar-a-Lago, threw documents haphazardly all over the floor (perhaps pretending it was me that did it!), and then started taking pictures of them for the public to see,' he said in a Truth Social post Wednesday morning.

'Thought they wanted them kept Secret? Lucky I Declassified!' he added during a flurry of posts condemning the FBI agent who retired amid backlash over the Hunter Biden probe.

He was responding to the bombshell pictures showing papers - with many marked 'top secret' - on the carpet of Florida mansion during the August 8 search.

The photographs were released in a 36-page court filing where officials said they'd uncovered a plot to obstruct the probe into the discovery of government records.

The DOJ accused the ex-president's team of moving around and hiding classified documents they had previously searched for.

Donald Trump has claimed the FBI agents were responsible for throwing classified documents on the floor of Mar-a-Lago - and said they were 'perhaps pretending it was me who did it'

A photo of documents seized during the August 8 search of Mar-a-Lago was published on Tuesday night by the Justice Department

Agents stand guard outside Mar-a-Lago on August 8, as the FBI was searching the property

Officials claimed they were 'likely concealed and removed' from a padlocked storage room where Trump's lawyers had said they were all kept together.

Three classified documents were found in a desk drawer, DOJ revealed, in addition to more than 100 documents discovered in 13 boxes with classification markings in the former president's residence.

'Three classified documents that were not located in boxes, but rather were located in the desks in the '45 Office,' were also seized,' the filing states.

The new court filing also shot down attempts to get a 'special master' - a third party - to review the documents seized by the FBI, branding the move 'unnecessary' and saying it would 'harm national security interests'.

The FBI seized 33 boxes with over 100 classified records during its raid - and found classified documents stashed in Trump's office, according to the filing.

The filing, released late Tuesday, lays out the most detailed chronology of months of strained interactions between the DOJ and the ex-president's team.

It offers another indication of the sheer volume of classified records retrieved from Mar-a-Lago.

It shows how investigators conducting a criminal probe have focused not just on why the records were stored there, but also on whether the Trump team intentionally misled them about the continued, and unlawful, presence of the top secret documents.

The timeline laid out by the Justice Department made clear that the extraordinary search of Mar-a-Lago came only after other efforts to retrieve the records had failed.

It shows it resulted from law enforcement suspicion additional documents remained inside the mansion despite assurances a 'diligent search' had accounted for them.

Police are seen outside Mar-a-Lago as Trump supporters gather to show their allegiance

The above timeline highlights just some of former president Donald Trump's battles with the National Archives since leaving office, including an unrelated court fight with the January 6 committee

The new picture shows some of the seized documents bearing clear classification markings, suggesting whoever saw them would know they were sensitive.

The photo shows the cover pages of a smattering of paperclip-bound classified documents.

Some were marked 'TOP SECRET//SCI' with bright yellow borders and one was marked as 'SECRET//SCI' with a rust-colored border.

There were also ones with whited-out pages and a cardboard box filled with gold-framed pictures, including a Time magazine cover.

The Justice Department filing does not resolve a core question that has driven public fascination with the investigation - why Trump held on to the documents after he left the White House and why he and his team resisted repeated efforts to give them back. In fact, it suggests officials may not have received an answer.

During a June 3 visit to Mar-a-Lago by FBI and Justice Department officials, the document states, 'Counsel for the former President offered no explanation as to why boxes of government records, including 38 documents with classification markings, remained at the Premises nearly five months after the production of the Fifteen Boxes and nearly one-and-a-half years after the end of the Administration.'

That visit to Mar-a-Lago, which came weeks after the Justice Department issued a subpoena for the records, receives substantial attention in the document and appears to be a key investigative focus.

Though Trump has said he had declassified all of the documents at Mar-a-Lago, his lawyers did not suggest that during the visit and instead 'handled them in a manner that suggested counsel believed that the documents were classified,' according to the document.

The suit filed by Trump on August 12, seeking to have a 'special master' oversee the investigation into the documents, includes an itemized list of property the FBI seized and seeks a more detailed accounting. One box contained 'Miscellaneous Top Secret Documents'

'Mar-a-Lago is a historical mansion with 58 bedrooms and 33 bathrooms on 17 acres of land extending from the Atlantic Ocean to the Intracoastal Waterway,' the suit points out. A DOJ official was shown a storage room where government documents were stored alongside clothing

The former president was at Trump Tower in New York City when his home was raided, his son Eric Trump told Fox News that night

FBI agents who went there to receive additional materials were given 'a single Redweld envelope, double-wrapped in tape, containing the documents,' the filing states.

That envelope, according to the FBI, contained 38 unique documents with classification markings, including five documents marked confidential, 16 marked secret, and 17 marked top secret.

During that visit, the document says, Trump´s lawyers told investigators that all the records that had come from the White House were stored in one location - a Mar-a-Lago storage room - and that 'there were no other records stored in any private office space or other location at the Premises and that all available boxes were searched.'

After that, though, the Justice Department, which had subpoenaed video footage for the property, 'developed evidence that government records were likely concealed and removed from the Storage Room and that efforts were likely taken to obstruct the government´s investigation.' The filing does not identify the individuals who may have relocated the boxes.

In their August search, agents found classified documents both in the storage room and in the former president´s office - including three classified documents found not in boxes, but in office desks.

'That the FBI, in a matter of hours, recovered twice as many documents with classification markings as the `diligent search´ that the former president´s counsel and other representatives had weeks to perform calls into serious question the representations made in the June 3 certification and casts doubt on the extent of cooperation in this matter,' the document states.

It says, 'In some instances, even the FBI counterintelligence personnel and DOJ attorneys conducting the review required additional clearances before they were permitted to review certain documents.'

The suit demands a special master oversee materials seized in the FBI's raid of Mar-a-Lago, and calls Donald Trump the 'clear frontrunner in the 2024 Republican presidential primary'

The investigation began from a referral from the National Archives and Records Administration, which recovered 15 boxes from Mar-a-Lago in January that were found to contain 184 documents with classified markings, including top secret information.

The purpose of the Tuesday night filing was to oppose a request from the Trump legal team for a special master to review the documents seized during this month's search and set aside those protected by claims of legal privilege. U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon is set to hear arguments on the matter on Thursday.

Cannon on Saturday said it was her 'preliminary intent' to appoint such a person but also gave the Justice Department an opportunity to respond.

On Monday, the department said it had already completed its review of potentially privileged documents and identified a 'limited set of materials that potentially contain attorney-client privileged information.' It said Tuesday that a special master was, therefore 'unnecessary.'

In a separate development, the Trump legal team has grown with the addition of another attorney.

Chris Kise, Florida's former solicitor general, has joined the team of lawyers representing Trump, according to two people familiar with the matter who were not authorized to discuss the move by name and spoke on condition of anonymity. Kise did not return messages seeking comment.

In January, 15 boxes of documents were retrieved from Mar-a-Lago and returned to the National Archive: their recovery was reported in the media in February.

The bureau found 184 classified documents in that initial tranche, triggering an investigation into what else the former president could be holding on to.

After the National Archives discovered the classified material, some of which pertained to intelligence-gathering and clandestine human sources, it referred the matter to the FBI.

On May 11, the department lawyers obtained a subpoena to retrieve all materials marked as classified that were not turned over by the former president.

On June 3, FBI agents visited Mar-a-Lago to discuss the return of the documents: Trump's team presented F.B.I. agents with 38 additional documents with classified markings, including 17 labeled top secret.

Yet still more documents remained at the estate, despite the requests to hand them over, and so the August 8 raid was approved.

Trump's defenses for why he retained the materials have shifted, and he has not offered a reason for why he did not give all the records back.

He has previously claimed he declassified all the records, pointing to a president's broad declassification powers. But Tuesday's filing by the government denied this.

In total, 320 documents marked classified, some at the most restrictive levels, have been recovered from Trump since he left the White House, per a count by the Associated Press.

A padlocked basement full of documents in Mar-a-Lago, the DOJ's counterintelligence chief and boxes of classified files: How investigators 'met Trump lawyers in JUNE to ask about 'missing' files in search that began last year'

Donald Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida was raided by the FBI on August 8, with the former president revealing the news in a furious and lengthy statement.

The unannounced search was related to White House documents sought by the National Archives, his son Eric Trump told Fox News later that night.

Federal agents 'ransacked' his father's office, he said, and in his own statement the former president accused them of breaking into his safe.

But Trump's issues with the National Archives reportedly began before he even left office.

Politico reported in 2018 that aides were forced to follow the then-president around to tape back documents that he had shredded - a habit the Republican was known for during his prior life heading the Trump Organization - in fear of running afoul of record-keeping laws.

And late last year, Trump attempted to slow the release of presidential documents from the National Archives to the House select committee investigating the January 6 attack.

It's not clear what specifically is being investigated, but it's worth noting there are laws on the books against tampering and destruction of classified presidential records.

Below is a timeline piecing together reports of the former president's legal battle with the Capitol riot committee over his documents, which appeared to run parallel to the National Archives' own efforts to recover classified pages from Trump.

The New York Times reported on August 9 that the two are not related.

Trump sues January 6 committee to block National Archives records

In October 2021, the former president launched a lawsuit against the Democrat-led House panel and the National Archives to block the release of White House records linked to last year's Capitol riot.

Trump's lawyers called the probe a 'fishing expedition' in a 26-page lawsuit filed in mid-October.

The attorneys had also requested that the National Archives send Trump's team any documents that could be relevant for review.

Trump lost the case along with two subsequent appeals later that year.

The January 6 committee revealed on January 19 that it had begun receiving documents from the National Archives that Trump 'had hoped to keep hidden.'

It happened the same day as the Supreme Court rejecting Trump's last-ditch request to shield his records.

Nine justices voted against the former president, including three who he appointed to the bench.

Only Clarence Thomas, whose wife Ginni is now being investigated by the committee over her efforts to push Trump's election fraud claims, voted in Trump's favor.

In addition to his own documents, the tranche also included records belonging to White House legal counsel, ex-adviser Stephen Miller and ex-Chief of Staff Mark Meadows, The Guardian reported.

National Archives reveals some Trump records were 'torn up'

The record-keeping body confirmed to the Washington Post on January 31 that the documents it handed to the January 6 committee 'included paper records that had been torn up by former President Trump.'

At this point the National Archives had reportedly handed more than 700 pages to the committee.

Not all of them had been taped back together at the time of the committee's receipt.

'These were turned over to the National Archives at the end of the Trump Administration, along with a number of torn-up records that had not been reconstructed by the White House,' the Archives reportedly said.

Trump's 15 boxes of sensitive White House documents

The next month, the National Archives revealed that Trump had taken 15 boxes full of White House records to his Mar-a-Lago retreat after leaving Washington, DC the year before.

Officials from the Archives and the Records Administration had to retrieve the boxes this past January.

It was first reported by the Washington Post on February 7.

Items that were improperly taken and had to be retrieved included what Trump called 'love letters' exchanged with North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un.

A letter from then-outgoing President Barack Obama to Trump when he first took office was also among the trove.

National Archives asks Justice Department to probe Trump record-keeping

Two days after it was revealed that Trump took 15 boxes of White House documents to Mar-a-Lago, the National Archives stepped up its enforcement by asking the Justice Department to probe the ex-president's handling of the sensitive pages.

The Archives asked President Joe Biden's DOJ to investigate whether Trump violated the Presidential Records Act, a source told CNN on February 9.

The Washington Post reported the next day that some of the files in the 15 boxes the Archives had retrieved were marked as 'top secret' - spurring security concerns.

Trump released a lengthy statement claiming he was 'under siege' and that federal agents broke into his safe

At the time, Trump's spokesman Taylor Budowich said the records retrieving process was 'normal and routine' but was being 'weaponized by anonymous, politically motivated government sources to peddle Fake News.'

While the controversy between the former president and government record-keepers only gained steam earlier this year, a February 13 CNN report reveals that the National Archives knew as early as May 2021 that documents had been missing.

National Archives counsel Gary Stern reportedly first contacted an official in the White House who had been named the point-person for records-keeping matters.

Stern apparently reached out to one of Trump's other lawyers after his efforts to get the records appeared to be slow-walked.

At the time of the February report, one person told CNN the matter had 'not been fully resolved' and the National Archives was still seeking more documents from Trump.

'Former President Trump's representatives have informed NARA that they are continuing to search for additional Presidential records that belong to the National Archives,' the Archives said in a statement.

Classified documents were among the 15 boxes Trump took, National Archives says

A week later, the National Archives confirmed an earlier Washington Post report that top secret documents were among the trove that Trump took to Mar-a-Lago with him.

The body said in a statement published on February 18 that it was 'in communication' with the DOJ on Trump-retrieved documents that were 'marked as classified national security information.'

In response to letters from the House Oversight Committee seeking more information on the matter, the Archives revealed the sensitive nature of the documents and added that social media and other online records from White House aides had not been properly stored.

The body said Trump aides had been warned about the matter previously.

DOJ summons grand jury in National Archives probe and grills Trump staffers

After months of silence, the Justice Department was revealed in May to be investigating whether Trump or others mishandled classified White House documents.

The DOJ convened a grand jury in the probe, the New York Times reported on May 12.

Prosecutors had subpoenaed the relevant documents from the National Archives, and CNN revealed they questioned Trump aides in April and May of this year.

Four top DOJ officials traveled to Mar-a-Lago in early June to speak with the former president's attorneys about the documents, it was reported the day after the FBI raid.

In revealing the visit CNN noted how 'rare' in nature it was.

The DOJ's counterintelligence and export control section chief Jay Bratt was reportedly among the group who sat down with Trump's lawyers.

Trump's team had also shown the government officials where Trump were storing documents.

Investigators reportedly observed that some of the files there were marked as classified.

At one point the former president himself reportedly stopped in to say hello and 'make small talk' before leaving again.

Feds raid Mar-a-Lago on August 8

It was reported that the FBI's operation at Mar-a-Lago occurred in the early hours of August 8.

The ex-president had been at Trump Tower in New York City at the time. His son Eric Trump told Fox he informed his father of the raid.

CNN reported that federal agents' activity was exclusively kept to the portions of the club where Trump's office and residence are.

The former president claimed he was a victim of political persecution in a statement that revealed the unannounced search to the public.

'These are dark times for our Nation, as my beautiful home, Mar-A-Lago in Palm Beach, Florida, is currently under siege, raided, and occupied by a large group of FBI agents,' Trump said through his Save America PAC.

'I stood up to America 's bureaucratic corruption, I restored power to the people, and truly delivered for our Country, like we have never seen before.

'The establishment hated it.

'Now, as they watch my endorsed candidates win big victories, and see my dominance in all polls, they are trying to stop me, and the Republican Party, once more. The lawlessness, political persecution, and Witch Hunt must be exposed and stopped.'

Trump 'bragged for years he had intelligence on ''naughty'' Macron's sex life' - so is THAT what was in file seized from Mar-a-Lago and listed as 'info re: President of France'?

Donald Trump bragged to some of his closest allies that he had 'intelligence' on French President Emmanuel Macron's sex and love life that he learned during his time as president, a new report reveals.

Two people with knowledge of the matter told Rolling Stone that Trump claimed to have learned about the dirt on Macron through briefings and viewing intelligence, but they admit it was sometimes hard to discern what information was real because he was a gossip.

'It is often hard to tell if he's bullsh***ing or not,' one source said.

Macron, 44, has been married to his wife Brigitte, 69, since 2007.

Nearly 25 years his senior, Brigitte was previously Macron's teacher before the two got married.

After the FBI raid on Trump's Mar-a-Lago estate earlier this month, it released a list of documents seized, including item 1A, which was listed as 'info re: President of France.'

It is not clear what was on that particular document, if it contained information that was classified or was collected from intelligence or whether it had anything to do with Macron's personal life.

Sources claim that Trump's musing about Macron's behavior did not include details or specifics and were more general accusations of indiscretions.

A Trump spokesperson did not immediately respond to a DailyMail.com request for comment.

Stephanie Grisham, who served as Trump's press secretary at one point, wrote in a memoir that Trump had privately called Macron a 'a wuss guy' and 'a hundred twenty pounds of fury.'

The former U.S. president and French president had a volatile relationship, which included a fallout during Trump's time in office.

Pictured (L-R) Melania Trump, Donald Trump, Emmanuel Macron and Brigitte Macron pose ahead of a working dinner on August 24, 2019 in Biarritz, France during the 45th G7 summit

In the 2017 French presidential race, Trump initially signaled support for Macron's rival, but that didn't stop the French president from inviting the U.S. president at the time to be a guest of honor at a Bastille Day parade the same year of his reelection.

During a White House gathering of international ambassadors to the United Nations in 2019, Trump was heard calling Macron a 'pain in the ass'.

The revelation of the document on Macron rattled France, two other sources familiar with the situation noted.

Trump talking about Macron's allegedly 'naughty' ways that '[not] very many people know' intensified concerns and pushed French and U.S. officials to figure out what the former president had on him, according to the sources.

Specifically, they wanted to know if the document was a national security breach.

But Trump seems much more concerned with Macron's love and sex life than intelligence details that could potentially pose security concerns.

Macron's romance with his now-wife began when he was 16-years-old and started seeing his literature and drama teacher at a Catholic high school in Amiens, then Brigitte Auzière.

In his book and political manifesto Revolution, President Macron described the affair as 'a love often clandestine, often hidden, misunderstood by many before imposing itself.'

Emmanuel Macron started seeing his high school literature and drama teacher when he was a teenager. A 15-year-old Macron is seen kissing his then 40-year-old teacher, then Brigitte Auzière, in a documentary on their unconventional relationship

Brigitte was married with three children when she began an affair with her teenage student Emmanuel Macron.

Her youngest daughter Tiphaine Auzière, now 38, said in a documentary film in 2018 that she was just nine when she learned of the affair and her father, André-Louis Auzière, moved out of the family home in Amiens to go live in Lille.

Despite Macron's doctor parents asking Brigitte to stop seeing him until he was 18, she said: 'I can't promise you anything.'

The two continued seeing each other even after Macron's parents sent him to Paris to continue his education. Brigitte finally divorced her husband in 2006 and wed Macron in 2017.

The FBI raided Trump's Mar-a-Lago estate on August 8 to recover documents and materials he took from the White House when leaving office last year

This isn't the first time that Trump has fixated on the sexual and romantic relationships of his rivals.

For example, as Josh Mandel and J.D Vance vied for Trump's endorsement in the Ohio Senate race, the former president called Mandel's sex life 'f***ing weird', according to a February report.

The same source said Trump 'has talked about [Mandel] and sex in the same sentence more times than I would have liked to hear.'

Grisham also wrote in her memoir that Trump pulled her aside on Air Force One after seeing Justin Trudeau on TV and made a crass claim about the sex life of the Canadian Prime Minister's mother.

During the 2016 campaign, Trump also gossiped about MSNBC hosts Mika Brzezinski and Joe Scarborough's relationship soon before it was public, according to a book by reporters who covered the Trump presidency.

'You know, nobody else knows about it, but I know about Joe and Mika's little apartment in the Upper East Side,' he said.

Kyrsten Sinema, who perplexed even Joe Biden with her moderation, asked the president not to come to Arizona after he signed the $1.9T American Rescue Plan and put up a fight against wearing a mask at the White House, according to a new book.

In spring 2021, the Arizona Democrat 'became the first-ever lawmaker to argue with White House aides when they asked her to wear a face mask in the company of the president, repeatedly asking why that was necessary when she had been vaccinated,' New York Times reporters Alexander Burns and Jonathan Martin write in their new book 'This Will Not Pass.'

On Tuesday, Sinema joined seven other Senate Democrats in voting to void a CDC rule mandating masks on public transportation and in hubs like airports.

Sinema also reportedly discouraged Biden from visiting her state after Democrats pushed through the massive Covid relief package despite voting for the legislation and publicly touting its benefits.

President Biden is reportedly perplexed by the Arizona Democrat, a stalwart against his legislative agenda

The senator privately characterized herself as anti-tax and anti-government at a fundraiser in D.C. in front of a group of lobbyists.

She reportedly mocked Biden while she spoke warmly of far-right Republican Rep. Andy Biggs, Ariz.

'I love Andy Biggs,' she said, according to an excerpt of the book published by Axios. 'I know some people think he's crazy, but that's just because they don't know him.'

Biden meanwhile did not understand the Arizona Democrat who together with Sen. Joe Manchin stood in the way of some of his biggest legislative promises.

Biden met with and called both Democrats numerous times as he lobbied for them to get behind his Build Back Better plan. Neither ultimately did - Sinema concerned about corporate tax increases and Manchin concerned about the cost, and the legislation fell by the wayside.

One person close to the president likened his confusion by Sinema to his 'difficulty grasping his grandchildren's use of ... TikTok.'

Aides reportedly said she sounded more like Sen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, than a Democrat.

Sinema said that there were five or six moderate Democrats 'hiding behind my skirt' as she pushed back on the left.

Sinema, together with Sen. Joe Manchin, stood in the way of Biden's Build Back Better plan

The Republican-friendly centrist has taken heat from across her party, in January facing a censure from Arizona Democrats for her opposition to ending the filibuster, the 60-vote hurdle needed to pass most legislation. Democrats had sought to end the filibuster to pass voting rights reform - the John Lewis Voting Rights Act and the Freedom to Vote Act. Manchin too opposed eliminating the filibuster, which forces Democrats to court 10 Republican votes to get through most legislation.

The book's authors also reveal that Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., a back-and-forth Trump ally, called White House counsel Pat Cipollone on Jan. 6 and told him that if President Trump did not more aggressively order rioters to stand down 'we'll be asking you for the 25th Amendment' to remove him from office.

Graham even suggested that Jan. 6 could be a turning point for his party, and that President Biden was the right person to take over the White House at the time.

He told the authors on the day of the riot: 'People will say, 'I don't want to be associated with that' ... There will be a rallying effect for a while, the country says: We're better than this.'

'He's worried about it,' one adviser close to Trump told CNN, saying that Trump had remained mostly silent since leaving the White House due to fears of potential criminal liability.

After the Senate voted 57-43 to acquit Trump of incitement to insurrection on Saturday, even several top Republicans who voted to acquit suggested that criminal charges could be warranted.

'The ultimate accountability is through our criminal justice system where political passions are checked,' said Senator Thom Tillis, a North Carolina Republican who voted not guilty.

'No president is above the law or immune from criminal prosecution, and that includes former president Trump,' Tillis added.

Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, who also voted to acquit, unloaded on Trump in a harsh diatribe following the trial, saying the former president was 'practically and morally responsible' for the events of January 6.

He also noted that though Trump is now out of office, he remains subject to the country's criminal and civil laws.

'Impeachment was never meant to be the final forum for American justice. … We have a criminal justice system in this country. We have civil litigation. And former Presidents are not immune from being held accountable by either one,' said McConnell.

'He didn't get away with anything yet,' said McConnell, who turns 79 next Saturday and has led the Senate GOP since 2007.

Federal investigators are looking at all aspects of the Capitol attack, and have already arrested more than 200 rioters on a range of charges.

When acting US Attorney Michael Sherwin was asked directly in January if Trump's role was under investigation, he responded: 'We're looking at all actors here and anyone that had a role and, if the evidence fits the elements of the crime, they're going to be charged.'

Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, who also voted to acquit, unloaded on Trump in a harsh diatribe following the impeachment trial

Separate from the Capitol attack, Trump faces legal threats on a number of fronts after losing the many protections afforded by the presidency.

In Georgia, prosecutors are investigating whether Trump tried to illegally influence election results when he asked a state official to ""find"" one more vote than he needed to win.

Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis is investigating Trump after a January 2 telephone call he made pressuring Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger to overturn the state's election results based on unfounded voter fraud claims.

The investigation is the second known state criminal probe of Trump, whose tax and business affairs are under investigation in New York.

Manhattan District Attorney Cy Vance Jr's probe into the Trump Organization for potential tax, bank and insurance fraud is believed to be in an advanced stage.

A U.S. Supreme Court decision is expected soon on whether Vance can obtain eight years of Trump's tax records and other financial information from accounting firm Mazars.

The tax returns are views as the keystone to the case. People close to the case have told Reuters that they expect the court to act as soon as this month.

The Trump Organization has denied in court filings that the company falsified property values, and Trump has rejected the probe as a 'fishing expedition' and a 'continuation of the witch hunt.'

In a statement on Saturday soon after his Senate acquittal, Trump hinted at the prospect of a political comeback.

'Our historic, patriotic and beautiful movement to Make America Great Again has only just begun,' Trump said. 'In the months ahead I have much to share with you, and I look forward to continuing our incredible journey together to achieve American greatness for all of our people.'

'We have so much work ahead of us, and soon we will emerge with a vision for a bright, radiant, and limitless American future,' he added.",Trump is worried about criminal charges over Capitol riot after his acquittal in the Senate,1

According to La Jornada the chaos may have been a deliberate scheme by the convicts to create an escape opportunity.

A total of four firearms were confiscated in the aftermath, s ecretary of Public Security Ismael Camberos Hernández said.

The medium security prison houses around 1,000 inmates and had recently undergone a search for contraband and weapons, the authorities said.

Hernández said Monday's search uncovered: 'Seventy-seven bags of marijuana, 18 packages of rice paper, 17 knives, a saw, a 9mm cartridge, three pairs of scissors, nine phones, phone chargers, a phone battery, a memory disk, two hammers, a bottle of liquor and a can of beer jug.'

The family says Cleveland Dodd, 16, had 'never, ever self-harmed' before the morning of October 12, when he was being held at Banksia Hill Juvenile Detention Centre Unit 18.

'Our beloved young one had never self-harmed in all his years, so what happened to him in his days unlawfully detained long hours in that horrible place known as Unit 18?,' the statement said.

'We want to know the truth about his every day in Unit 18. He should have been with his families which he loved dearly.'

It's used to house the 'most challenging, complex and often dangerous juveniles,' according to Corrective Services Minister Paul Papalia.

He has not ruled out wielding the axe at the very top of the Department of Justice as the WA government of Roger Cook came under intense pressure on Friday.

'I'm considering every element of this situation, and I'll be determining our further action in coming days,' Mr Papalia said.

He said he had offered to meet Cleveland's family and said he was 'doing everything possible to improve' Unit 18.

Premier Roger Cook, who was at an event with Prime Minister Anthony Albanese on Friday, said he was 'deeply saddened' by Cleveland's death and offered his 'wholehearted condolences to the family'.

Cleveland's family say he had been 'unlawfully locked down, day after day, inside Unit 18,' which 'drove him to take his own life in desperation.'

'We as a First Nations People have been suffering from one generation to another, and we cannot stand by and watch this carnage on our children,' their statement, released on Friday, said.

'The coronial inquest into his death will take far too long to bring meaningful change, policy and law reform.

'We, his family and community, will not wait patiently in the wings while legal processes run their course.'

They're urging the state government to act now to prevent another loss of life at Banksia Hill.

'Future commitments, platitudes and unfulfilled promises only inflict more pain,' Cleveland's family said.

On Friday, it was also revealed the state's Corruption and Crime Commission (CCC) will be investigating a serious misconduct allegation levelled at a public officer in relation to Cleveland's death.

The family's lawyers, Levitt Robinson Solicitors, said they're pleased to be acting on behalf of the family in the coronial inquest.

'So that evidence of the foreseeability of the harm which West Australian courts have already recognised will be caused to young people detained in Unit 18, located in Casuarina Prison, will be fully exposed,' the firm said in a statement.

Premier Cook said he was 'deeply saddened' by Cleveland's death, but declined to apologise to the boy's family.

'These are difficult issues dealing with complex troubled young people and one of the key tragedies here is the social and economic circumstances that led to their incarceration in the first place,' Mr Cook said.

'The situation in Unit 18 is not where we want it to be ... but it is a circumstance which has been handed to us.'

He added that his government is trying to close Unit 18, but can't at the moment due to structural damage at Banksia Hill caused by a riot in May.

“The Islamic Republic is falling. Join the people,” said one handed out in northern Rasht city. In southern Ahvaz organisers gave an address and time for protest, and a broader call to action. “If you cannot come, spread the message so other people come,” it urged readers.

Hours later a video from Ahvaz showed women dancing in the street, their hair uncovered, waving their headscarves in the air as a crowd lined up along the edge of the street applauded.

Two weeks into a wave of anti-government protests across Iran, authorities in Tehran seem increasingly frightened by the scale and determination of the popular uprising against their rule, and increasingly ruthless in their attempts to crush it.

The security forces have used live ammunition and brutal force on protesters, and swamped central Tehran with riot police. Dozens of people have been killed – tolls from human rights groups and Iranian state media range between 40 and 83. At least 1,500 have been arrested, according to the Associated Press.

Authorities have tried to hinder planning and reporting of protests with an online crackdown, banning social media apps, restricting internet access and trying to silence celebrities who support the movement. One football player has been arrested; the statue of another has been torn down.

The campaign of terror and obstruction has so far scattered the protests, but failed to stop them. Iranian demonstrators are determined to keep coming out.

“You see something about a gathering (online) and then you go there, and you are not sure whether you will come back home alive or not,” said Negar*, a protester from Tehran who spoke to the Observer by phone.

She pointed out that a revolution brought Iran’s current rulers to power long before the digital age. “The people have decided what they have to do. Just remember there was no internet in 1979 and people did what they wanted.” Some protesters set plans for a new gathering before they disperse, or have several familiar protest sites.

“We tell each other on the scene where and when we would gather next time. But mostly you know where people would gather, and you do not need to arrange anything,” said Nosheen*, a resident of north Tehran.

Others are chanting from the rooftops where the streets feel too dangerous, or using VPNs to dodge government controls on the flow of digital information.

The protests were sparked by the death in custody of Mahsa Amini, a 22-year-old Kurdish woman, after her arrest by the morality police. But they morphed into a broader anti-government campaign – led by women and focused on the controls on their lives – but fuelled by wider discontent.

It is a movement that has been nurtured online, where Iranian and foreign celebrities tweet and hashtag their support, and powerful images carry protesters’ messages far beyond their own borders.

One photograph that has gone viral shows a young woman, standing by the grave of her mother, killed in the protests. Her head is shaven and uncovered, and in her hand she holds locks of flowing hair, cut off in mourning and opposition.

Women have led the protests, with their bodies on the streets and behind the scenes. “I was a little bit scared at first but when I saw that many women on the streets it gave me the courage to continue,” said Negar, a veteran of other protest movements who is in her 40s.

“Much of the time the men are just watching. Women organise and do everything. It’s completely different from previous times. Women are in charge. They are leading.” Security forces’ response has included tearing down a statue of Iranian football legend Ali Karimi after he used his social media to support the protests and share practical tips on avoiding internet controls. Protesters responded by spraying his name on the empty plinth.

On Saturday university students defied orders to return to their classrooms. At the University of Tehran they chanted “Justice, freedom, optional hijab”, before security forces clashed with them.

At Isfahan university a video shared on social media apparently showed a woman setting her headscarf on fire, and in Mashhad crowds chanted “students will die but we will not accept humiliation.”

Central Tehran was quiet under the watchful eye of a heavy security force presence, but protests continued elsewhere in the city.

“All forces are masked and sometimes when I go out, I feel like I’m walking in a war video game,” said one Tehran resident. “They are trying to scare people so they do not gather for protests, but people do not care and they keep gathering.”

One Saturday protest was held not far from the official residence of the supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. The group were close enough that if he stepped outside, the wind might have carried to his ears the chants of women determined to fight against almost impossible odds.

“We will continue until they kill every single one of us,” Nosheen said. “They fired teargas directly at us the other night, my eyes were burning, I could not sleep all night, but still I went out the next night, with my tears and pain in my eyes.”

https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/mar/30/garbage-strike-and-candle-lit-vigils-as-myanmar-death-toll-passes-500,1,"Myanmar protesters have held overnight candle-lit vigils and launched a civil disobedience campaign of hurling garbage on to streets after an advocacy group said security forces had killed more than 500 people since the 1 February coup.

Out of 14 civilians killed in Myanmar on Monday, the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners (AAPP) said at least eight were in the South Dagon district of Yangon.

Security forces in the area fired a much heavier-calibre weapon than usual on Monday to clear a barricade of sand bags, witnesses said. It was not immediately clear what type of weapon was used.

State television said security forces used “riot weapons” to disperse a crowd of “violent terrorist people” who were destroying a pavement and one man was wounded.

A South Dagon resident on Tuesday said more gunfire could be heard in the area overnight, raising concerns of further casualties. Police and the junta did not answer calls seeking comment.

The UN secretary general, António Guterres, urged Myanmar’s generals to stop the killings and repression of demonstrations.

In a new tactic, protesters sought to step up a civil disobedience campaign on Tuesday by asking residents to throw garbage on to streets at key road intersections. “This garbage strike is a strike to oppose the junta,” read a poster on social media.

The move came in defiance of calls issued via loudspeakers in some neighbourhoods of Yangon on Monday urging residents to dispose of garbage properly.

At least 510 civilians had been killed in nearly two months of efforts to stop protests, advocacy group AAPP said. The total killed on Saturday, the bloodiest day so far, had risen to 141, its figures showed.

One of the main groups behind the protests, the General Strike Committee of Nationalities, called on Monday in an open letter for ethnic minority forces to help those standing up to the “unfair oppression” of the military.

In a sign that the call may be gaining more traction, three groups in a joint letter on Tuesday called on the military to stop killing peaceful protesters and resolve political issues.

The groups – which include the Myanmar National Democratic Alliance Army, the Arakan Army and Ta’ang National Liberation Army – warned if the military did not do this they “will cooperate with all nationalities who are joining Myanmar’s spring revolution in terms of self-defence”.

Insurgents from different ethnic groups have battled the central government for decades for greater autonomy. Though many groups have agreed to ceasefires, fighting has flared in recent days between the army and forces in the east and north.

Heavy clashes erupted on the weekend near the Thai border between the army and fighters from Myanmar’s oldest ethnic minority force, the Karen National Union (KNU).

About 3,000 villagers fled to Thailand when military jets bombed a KNU area after a KNU force overran an army outpost and killed 10 soldiers, an activist group and media said.

Thai authorities denied accounts by activist groups that more than 2,000 refugees had been forced back, but a Thai official said it was government policy for the army to block them at the border and deny access to outside aid groups.

Myanmar’s military has for decades justified its grip on power by saying it is the only institution capable of preserving national unity. It seized power saying that November 2020 elections won by Aung San Suu Kyi’s party were fraudulent, an assertion dismissed by the election commission.

The US trade representative Katherine Tai said it was suspending all trade engagement with Myanmar until the return of a democratically elected government.

But foreign criticism and western sanctions have failed to sway the generals, and Aung San Suu Kyi remains in detention at an undisclosed location, with many other figures in her party also in custody.

Britain has called for an emergency UN security council meeting on the situation. The 15 members will sit behind closed doors on Wednesday with a briefing on the situation by the UN’s special envoy on Myanmar, Christine Schraner Burgener.

The council has previously condemned the violence and called for a restoration of democracy, but has not yet considered sanctions against the military, which would require support or an abstention from Myanmar’s neighbour and ally China.",'Garbage strike' and candle-lit vigils as Myanmar death toll passes 500,1

The president is expected to hammer home his 'law and order' campaign message when he arrives around 1pm EST, meeting with members of local law enforcement and surveying damage caused by three days of rioting sparked by the police shooting of Jacob Blake.

While the city is still counting the cost of the disturbance, the mayor has requested $30million in state aid to help repair the damage.

Trump insisted on coming to the state despite the objections of both Democratic governor Tony Evers and city mayor John Antaramian, amid 'concerns' that his presence will set back efforts to restore calm.

Large parts of Kenosha's uptown neighborhood - where many of the city's black and Hispanic residents live - were damaged or destroyed by rioters between August 23, the day of Blake's shooting, and August 25, when two protesters were shot dead.

Out-of-towners have been blamed for the majority of the rioting and the violence. The Kenosha sheriff's department says that, of the 175 people arrested during the riots, 102 of them have addresses outside the city.

Groups of armed 'vigilantes' who then arrived to 'protect' businesses from the rioters were also thought to be from outside the area - including 17-year-old Kyle Rittenhouse, who was behind Tuesday night's fatal shooting.

Rittenhouse, who is now in jail charged with murder, had traveled to Kenosha from Illinois, telling journalists he was there to 'help people' and 'protect businesses' before opening fire.

Protests have continued in Kenosha following the shooting, but have remained largely peaceful. A night-time curfew has been put in place.

Trump has defended Rittenhouse, saying that he was 'violently attacked' by Black Lives Matter protesters and 'probably would have been killed' if he hadn't shot at them.

Witnesses say protesters attempted to tackle Rittenhouse after he began shooting. Video shows the teenager firing at activists after being thrown to the floor, but does not show what started the confrontation.

Antaramian has asked for $30million of aid to repair the damage caused by the rioting, with at leas $2million of state property - including garbage trucks that were used to block roads - damaged, Kenosha News reports.

The owners of a car salesroom that was torched on August 23 told Fox News that the fire will cost them $1.5million, including almost $1million that went up in smoke when 100 cars in their lot caught ablaze.

The following night a large furniture store was also sent up in flames, with owner Linda Carpenter filmed weeping at the site of the destroyed business, which she had run for 40 years.

Also targeted was the Community Corrections Division building, which was set alight and ultimately collapsed.

The White House said Sunday evening Trump still plans to make his visit despite governor Evers sending a letter requesting he stay away.

'The White House has been humbled by the outreach of individuals from Kenosha who have welcomed the President's visit and are longing for leadership to support local law enforcement and businesses that have been vandalized,' Trump's Deputy Press Secretary Judd Deere said.

He added: 'President Trump looks forward to visiting on Tuesday and helping this great city heal and rebuild.'

Evers, a Democrat, said Sunday in a letter to President Trump that he is not welcome in Kenosha.

He urged him to reconsider his trip, writing: 'I, along with other community leaders who have reached out, are concerned about what your presence will mean for Kenosha and our state.'

Kenosha Mayor John Antaramian, also a Democrat, is hoping the president will not stop by his riot-torn city on Tuesday.

'While presidents are always welcome to come to this great city, this is not the best time for a visit,' Antaramian said in a statement Sunday.

'We are hurting today and we are focused on healing, coming together as a community and rebuilding. There is a lot of listening we need to do in Kenosha and I worry that a visit from the president will delay this important work.'

Piers Morgan, DailyMail.com's Editor-at-Large, said Trump's defense of the teen gunman behind last week's shootings was an 'absolutely outrageous twisting of reality'.

He argued that it was a sign Trump was 'ramping up his divisive fear-factor strategy' and warned on Tuesday that Democrats were heading for another election disaster.

'Many millions of Americans are watching the mayhem happening across their country and feel genuinely concerned that their lives or way of life may be at risk,' Morgan said. 'That's why Trump is now ramping up his divisive fear-factor strategy.'

'Rittenhouse had traveled 20 miles across a state line, armed with an illegal assault rifle, to make a personal stand against the protesters. But Trump knew his base would lap up his presidential support for him, just as they have lapped up his constant attacks on the rioters, looters and arsonists whose anarchical behavior has marred the otherwise mainly peaceful BLM protests since June.

'By positioning himself as the man to uphold law and order amid all the chaos, and Biden as the weak strawman liberal refusing to properly condemn liberal rioters, Trump has found himself a possible escape route from electoral ignominy when all seemed lost. And make no mistake, the more protesters continue to riot, loot or set fire to things, the more it will play into Trump's cynical hands.'

While in Kenosha, Trump has also attempted to arrange a meeting with the family of Jacob Blake, whose calls for calm in the wake of his shooting ultimately fell on deaf ears. No such meeting had been scheduled as of Tuesday.

Blake remains in hospital after being shot seven times in the back by an officer as he attempted to get into his car.

Police say they were called to the scene by Blake's partner, who told them he should not have been on her property. Blake's three children were in his car when he was shot.

Video shows officers with their guns on Blake, shouting at him as he walks around the side of the car and opens the driver door, before attempting to get in.

Police say a knife was subsequently found in the driver's side door. An investigation into the shooting is underway, and all three officers involved have been placed on administrative leave.

Rail bosses came under fire today for failing to table a pay offer to union barons despite nearly six months of strikes.

The Mail has learnt that a letter sent by train bosses to the RMT union last week pledged to make an offer in future but contained no details of when or what it is likely to be.

It means that, since the RMT first started striking in June, 14 train firms covering most of the country are yet to make an offer on pay and job security.

By contrast Network Rail, which manages infrastructure and is also involved in the dispute, tabled an offer months ago and is close to clinching a deal with the union.

Ministers were tonight urged to ‘read the riot act’ to train firms, which receive tens of millions of pounds of taxpayers’ cash, after they also struggled to ramp services back up after strikes this week were called off.

The longer they delay making an offer, the likelier walkouts drag on over Christmas and into the New Year.

RMT union (General Secretary Mick Lynch pictured) are yet to receive an offer from the Rail Delivery Group, who pledged to make an offer in future

The letter to the RMT from the Rail Delivery Group (RDG), which represents train operators, said train firms were willing to make an offer once ‘intense negotiations’ start, but stopped short of officially tabling anything

Last week the Mail revealed how the economy has already been hit by up to £600million, including around £200million in lost fare revenue, since the RMT strikes began in summer.

Tory MP Greg Smith, who sits on the Commons transport committee, said: ‘The unions have brought untold disruption to people’s lives over the last six months, but it is incumbent on the train operating companies to come up with their best and final offer on pay.

‘Nobody wants to see these strikes go on any longer and the vast majority of my constituents would want a fair and reasonable offer put on the table.

‘It’s time to get that best and final offer in front of the unions to try and put an end to this.’

Labour MP Ben Bradshaw, who also sits on the committee, said: ‘It’s absolutely disgraceful they haven’t put an offer on the table and the Government, given that these train companies receive tens of millions of pounds in taxpayers money, need to read them the riot act and order them to put an offer on the table so that this on-going misery for passengers can finally be ended. This isn’t going to resolve itself.’

Commons transport committee MPs have said it is time to get a final offer in front of the unions

The letter to the RMT from the Rail Delivery Group (RDG), which represents train operators, said train firms were willing to make an offer once ‘intense negotiations’ start, but stopped short of officially tabling anything.

Network Rail made an offer in the summer, which currently stands at a pay increase of 4 per cent this year and next.

Today the Mail revealed how the offer has been adjusted so that the pot of cash available could be ‘re-distributed’.

This means the lowest paid staff could get an increase worth at least 7 per cent - not far off the current 10 per cent rate of inflation. Those on higher incomes would get slightly lower.

Both sides are understood to be edging closer to a deal after Network Rail pledged not to force through changes to working practices, such as greater use of technology to detect faults on the line.

But even if a deal is struck, the dispute with the 14 rail firms will continue for as long as they fail to make an offer.

On Friday, November 4, the militant RMT called off strikes for the following day and Monday, but despite this just a fifth of services ran on Saturday and between 40-50 per cent on Monday.

Services only largely returned to normal today.

However, commuters in the capital will be hit by the sixth walkout this year on the London Underground on Thursday in a separate dispute over pensions and job losses.

Two members of the US Capitol Police Department (USCPD) described being subjected to vile racial abuse during the chaos that erupted Wednesday, which left five people dead – including one of their colleagues.

‘I got called a n***** 15 times,’ one of the officers, a veteran of the force, told Buzzfeed.

After the pro-Trump mob dispersed, the officer said he broke down in tears for around 15 minutes.

‘I sat down with one of my buddies, another black guy, and tears just started streaming down my face,’ the officer recalled. ‘I said, “What the f***, man? Is this America? What the f*** just happened? I’m so sick and tired of this s***.”’

One of the officers said he was upset to see how white colleagues were treating the mob, posing for selfies when some among the crowd were roaming the Capitol holding the Confederate flag

In the middle of the Rotunda, the veteran officer said he began to shout out, to no one in particular, ‘These are racist a** terrorists.’

‘I cried for about 15 minutes and I just let it out,’ he told Buzzfeed.

Another officer, who is a newer recruit to the department, described how he was forced to engage in hand-to-hand combat with the rioters, some of whom hurled Blue Lives Matter flags at him. He said cops were outnumbered roughly 10 to one.

‘We were telling them to back up and get away and stop, and they’re telling us, they are on our side, and they’re doing this for us, and they’re saying this as I’m getting punched in my face by one of them,’ the officer said.

‘We were getting pepper sprayed in the face by those protesters, I’m not going to even call them protesters, by those domestic terrorists.’

Shocking new footage emerged Sunday showing one Capitol police officer being yanked out of the building and beaten with a flagpole bearing the American flag.

The officer, who has not been identified, is seen being flung face first onto the Capitol steps and set upon by rioters, who beat him while he's lying defenseless. One member of the mob is also seen using a black baton on him.

One officer (not pictured) said he was attacked by members of the crowd who were carrying Blue Lives Matter flags (In the above image, an officer is seen in the middle of a melee with a crowd, with a Thin Blue Line flag - a symbol of support for law enforcement - visible top left)

The veteran officer, meanwhile, recounted to Buzzfeed his shock after coming face-to-face with a number of police officers from across the country among the mob.

‘You have the nerve to be holding a Blue Lives Matter flag, and you are out there f***ing us up,’ he said he told one group of protesters he encountered inside the Capitol. ‘[One guy] pulled out his badge and he said, “We’re doing this for you.” Another guy had his badge. So I was like, “Well, you gotta be kidding.”’

Police department across the country – including in Texas, Washington State, New Hampshire, Pennsylvania and California – have opened investigations into whether any of their own officers took part in the Capitol siege. So far, several officers and at least one police chief are facing potential termination or suspension.

One USCPD officer, Brian Sicknick, died 'from injuries sustained' while responding to the attack

The veteran cop continued that he believes images that have since surfaced showing the rioters marauding the Capitol’s halls in bizarre costumes have downplayed just how well prepared the group were to attack the legislature – and potentially harm Congress members.

‘That was a heavily trained group of militia terrorists that attacked us,’ the officer, who has been with the department more than a decade, told Buzzfeed.

He said many among the crowd came equipped with radios, two-way communicators and earpieces, in addition to homemade explosives and pipe bombs.

‘They were prepared … These guys were military trained. A lot of them were former military.’

The officer said that while the scenes that unfolded last Wednesday were difficult for all officers, he believes black officers found themselves in a particularly difficult position.

He said the police response to the riot also marked a stark contrast to how police handled Black Lives Matter protests in the summer.

‘There’s quite a big difference when the Black Lives Matter protests come up to the Capitol,’ he told the outlet. ‘[On Wednesday], some officers were catering to the rioters.’

The cop said he was upset to see images of white colleagues taking selfies with the attackers, seemingly enjoying their time with the mob, some of whose members were roaming the US Capitol clutching Confederate flags.

‘That one hurt me the most because I was on the other side of the Capitol getting my a** kicked,’ he said.

The officer affirmed that had it been a group of predominantly black Americans who had stormed the Capitol, he believes the police response would have been vastly different.

‘If you’re going to treat a group of demonstrators for Black Lives Matters one way, then you should treat this group the same goddamn way,’ he told Buzzfeed.

‘With this group you were being kind and nice and letting them walk back out. Some of them got arrested but a lot of them didn’t. Everyone who came into that Capitol should have been arrested regardless if they didn’t take anything.’

In excess of 50 people were arrested during Wednesday’s insurrection, with the number have increased to more than 80 in the days since, as federal authorities swoop in on some of the main agitators of the riot

The police response to the rioters has drawn claims of racist double standards in the broader public too.

‘No one can tell me that if it had been a group of Black Lives Matter protesters yesterday that they wouldn't have been treated very differently than the mob that stormed the Capitol,’ President-elect Joe Biden said Thursday.

‘We all know that's true — and it's unacceptable.’

Keneshia Grant, an associate professor of political science at Howard University, concurred, telling NBC: ‘I think it's absolutely true that the insurgents yesterday were treated with much more care than the folks who participated in the Black Lives Matter protests.

‘What we saw was a system of law enforcement that's designed to protect certain people.’

So far, at least 82 people have been arrested and more than 55 have been charged over the insurrection. Hundreds more are being hunted by the authorities but are yet to be found, including 25 people who are being investigated on terrorism charges.

Five people have also died. One protester, Ashli Babbitt, was shot dead as she attempted to climb through a shattered window of a barricaded door near to the chamber. Three protesters died from ‘medical emergencies’ and one officer, Brian Sicknick, died 'from injuries sustained' while responding to the attack.

Sicknick, 42, was hit in the head with a fire extinguisher during a struggle, two law enforcement officials told Associated Press.

Mr Khan was holding a People's Question Time event in Wandsworth, south London, when the incident occurred.

While parts of the protestor's audio is inaudible, the unnamed man can clearly be heard shouting that Mr Khan is attempting to demonise 'peaceful protestors'.

He then stops to ask if he can retrieve his bag before being ejected from the event, a request which is denied, before being escorted to the exit by security.

Matthew Goodwin-Freeman, Conservative councilor for Hatch End in Harrow, posted on X: '#BREAKING - Londoner dragged out of People's Question Time for standing up to Mayor Khan's 'far-right' labelling of anyone who disagrees with him! Disgraceful.'

The People's Question Time events happen roughly every six months and give the public the chance to put questions to the Mayor and the London Assembly.

Mr Khan previously caused controversy at one of the meetings at Ealing Town Hall in March 2023 after appearing to call protesters of London's Ultra Low Emission Zone (ULEZ) far-right.

Facing heckles from some in the crowd, Mr Khan said: 'What I find unacceptable is some of those who've got legitimate objections [about ULEZ] joining hands with some of those outside, who are part of a far-right group.'

The protester (right) was incensed over what a Conservative councillor said were Mr Khan's claims that his opponents were 'far-right'

He added: 'Let's be frank, let's call a spade a spade. Some of those outside are part of the far right. Some are Covid deniers, some are vaccine deniers and some are Tories.'

Back then his remarks were met with anger, with one member of the audience shouting: 'We are not the far-right, normal people are not the far-right.'

Conservative assembly member Peter Fortune also hit back at Mr Khan at the same event. He said: 'You heard it, didn't you? If you disagree with the mayor, he's going to paint you as far right.

'If you disagree with the mayor, he's going to say you're a science denier, he's going to say you're a Covid denier, he's going to say you're a flat earther, he's going to say you think there are aliens in Buckingham Palace, and Mr Blobby shot Kennedy.

'He's going to throw all this stuff at you, because he doesn't want to address the fact you've got legitimate concerns.'

However, there has reportedly been evidence of far-right activity outside some of the the People's Question Time events.

After the March 2023 gathering, Foreign Secretary David Lammy posted a photograph on X showing a placard fetauring Nazi symbols and painting Mr Khan as a Communist leader.

Mr Lammy said: 'Disgusting placards including swastikas at this march outside People's Question Time in Ealing tonight.

'The @CityHallTories should be ashamed of promoting this march which looks like it's been coordinated by the far right. We will not let them divide us.'

After rioting broke out across England and Northern Island in the summer of 2024 following false claims that the perpetrator of the attack that killed three girls in Southport was Muslim and an asylum seeker, Mr Khan said he felt 'triggered' and sought to blame the far right for the unrest.

Speaking to MSNBC, Mr Khan sought to pin the most extreme of the violence on 'these far right violent people, trying to burn down mosques, trying to burn down hostels housing asylum seekers, stopping cars to see whether those inside are white or people of colour.'

However, many of Mr Khan's critics felt that his depiction of the protesters ignored the legitimate concerns of Britons concerned about migration.

As the Daily Mail's Dr Rakib Ehsan wrote in August 2024: 'The right to protest is paramount in our democracy. But Britain feels on the cusp of serious disorder.

'Why do increasing numbers of people seem only too eager to take to the streets to make their views public?

'Whatever Sir Keir Starmer might like to think, most are not necessarily 'far-right': instead, many will have legitimate concerns about mass migration, the breakdown in law and order and what they see as 'two-tier' policing, whereby some protesters are treated more leniently by the authorities than others.

'They want to protect their families, their communities and their nation. Millions probably agree with them, even if they would never attend a protest, still less take part in a riot.'",Moment protester is dragged out of public meeting with Sadiq Khan as tempers fray during People's Question Time,1

'He can't have enough bodyguards to walk through New York City,' Cuomo said at an emergency press conference on Wednesday night. 'Forget bodyguards, he better have an army if he thinks he's going to walk down the streets in New York.'

'He is persona non grata in New York City, and I think he knows that, and he'll never come back to New York, because New Yorkers will never forget how gratuitously mean he has been,' Cuomo said.

It follows Trump's move on Wednesday to pull federal funding from New York City, Seattle, Washington DC, and Portland, Oregon, in a presidential memo saying 'My Administration will not allow Federal tax dollars to fund cities that allow themselves to deteriorate into lawless zones.'

New York Governor Andrew Cuomo (above) has rebuked President Donald Trump over his threat to pull federal funding from 'lawless' U.S. cities

Trump threatened on Wednesday to pull federal funding from 'anarchist' cities in a presidential memo saying 'My Administration will not allow Federal tax dollars to fund cities that allow themselves to deteriorate into lawless zones'

Cuomo responded in a tweet by calling the move 'an illegal stunt,' saying of Trump: 'He is not a king. He cannot 'defund' NYC.'

'As far as this statement he's going to stop funding for New York City - he's not a king. He thinks he's a king but he's not,' Cuomo said at the press conference.

'The statutes contain the conditions [for funding] and he can't override the law. I suspect it's more of a political statement that he's making than anything else, but it's also illegal what he's talking about,' Cuomo said.

New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio chimed in with a tweet calling Trump's moves 'unconstitutional, political threats against us.'

'Mr. President, we’ll see you in court. We’ve beaten you there before and we’ll do it again,' de Blasio said.

It followed Trump's threat to pull federal funding from cities he says are descending into 'anarchy'.

'My Administration will do everything in its power to prevent weak mayors and lawless cities from taking Federal dollars while they let anarchists harm people, burn buildings, and ruin lives and businesses. We're putting them on notice today,' Trump said in a tweet on Wednesday.

New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio chimed in with a tweet calling Trump's moves 'unconstitutional, political threats against us'

Trump on Wednesday signed a five-page memo ordering all federal agencies to send reports to the White House Office of Management and Budget on federal funds going to four cities that can be redirected, according to the New York Post, which first reported the memo.

In addition to New York, the memo names Seattle, Washington DC and Portland, Oregon as potential targets for revocation of federal funds.

'To ensure that Federal funds are neither unduly wasted nor spent in a manner that directly violates our Government's promise to protect life, liberty, and property, it is imperative that the Federal Government review the use of Federal funds by jurisdictions that permit anarchy, violence, and destruction in America's cities,' the memo states.

Federal agencies must detail 'all Federal funds provided to Seattle, Portland, New York City, Washington, D.C.'

All four cities have seen either surging crime over the summer or protests over racial injustice that have spilled into violence and riots.

Simultaneously, Trump ordered Attorney General Bill Barr to develop a list within 14 days of 'anarchist jurisdictions' that 'permitted violence and the destruction of property to persist and have refused to undertake reasonable measures' to restore order.

The order does not name the cities that Barr should investigate, giving the attorney general discretion as to which cities to designate.

The memo also instructs White House budget director Russ Vought to issue guidance in 30 days from Wednesday 'to the heads of agencies on restricting eligibility of or otherwise disfavoring, to the maximum extent permitted by law, anarchist jurisdictions in the receipt of Federal grants.'

The amount of funding in question could be massive, with federal grants making up $3.7 billion of DC's annual budget, and a whopping $7 billion in New York.

Many of those funds are devoted to Medicare and social services programs, however it was not immediately clear which types of funds would be affected by the order.

'Violence has surged' in New York City

In the memo, Trump detailed allegations of local mismanagement against each of the cities named, saying that New York was included because violent crime has skyrocketed even as Mayor Bill de Blasio moved to defund the NYPD.

Shootings in New York soared 166 percent last month compared to August 2019, and murder rose 47 percent, according to NYPD statistics released on Wednesday.

Trump's memo says that 'in New York City, city officials have allowed violence to spike.'

'In light of this unconscionable rise in violence, I have offered to provide Federal law enforcement assistance, but both Mayor de Blasio and Governor Andrew Cuomo have rejected my offer,' Trump says in the memo.

NYC crime wave: Shootings up 166% Shootings in New York City were up 166 percent last month compared to August 2019, according to police crime statistics released Wednesday. The Big Apple has seen a troubling spike in crime and violence this year, and new data shows there were 242 shootings recorded last month. In August 2019 there were just 91 shootings recorded. The number of shootings rose in all boroughs except Staten Island. The number of murders is also up citywide, increasing from 36 in August 2019 to 53 last month, marking a 47 percent rise.

'While violence has surged, arrests have plummeted. In a 28-day period during the months of June and July, [New York City] arrests were down 62 percent from the same period in 2019,' the memo says.

'Amidst the rising violence, Mayor Bill de Blasio and the New York City Council agreed to cut one billion dollars from the New York Police Department (NYPD) budget, including by cancelling the hiring of 1,163 officers.'

The memo also cites NYPD Commissioner Dermot Shea's decision in June to disband the plainclothes anti-crime units, which had been responsible for targeting illegal guns and drugs on the streets.

'Police officials have cited this decision as a factor contributing to the rise in violence,' the memo says.

Seattle allowed lawless CHAZ to fester, memo says

The memo targets Seattle largely for allowing the 'CHAZ' protest zone to occupy several city blocks for nearly a month.

In early June, Black Lives Matter protesters forced the Seattle Police Department to abandon the city's East Precinct building and commandeered the facility, establishing the 'Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone', or CHAZ, in the surrounding blocks.

The comandeered Seattle Police East Precinct is seen within the CHAZ in June

Protesters in Seattle's CHAZ remove a man after he attempted to preach a Christian message on the street in June. The memo names the CHAZ as a reason for defunding Seattle

Protesters manned barricades and barred city workers from entering the zone, but the area descended into lawlessness when three separate shootings occurred on June 20, 21, and 23.

'On July 1, Seattle declared the protest zone dismantled,' Trump's memo says. 'But such failed leadership continues to harm the people of Seattle as, in recent weeks, rioters have engaged in violence and destruction of property across Seattle, resulting in at least 59 police officers being injured and multiple businesses and vehicles vandalized.'

Portland is targeted for 'allowing 99 days of violent unrest'

The memo targets Portland for federal defunding for allowing weeks of nightly protests, where fires have been set and clashes with police are frequent.

Earlier this week, protesters who broke windows and set a fire to a business in the upscale apartment building where Portland Mayor Ted Wheeler lives.

Portland's police chief denounced the incident, labeling the events an escalation in the street violence that Oregon's largest city has endured for months.

The demonstration began late Monday and stretched into the predawn hours of Tuesday, targeting Wheeler, who is also police commissioner and has been criticized for heading up a police force that has repeatedly used tear gas against the demonstrators.

The fire was set with a bundle of newspapers in a store housed on the ground floor of Wheeler's building. There were no reports of major damage or injuries.

Portland Police Chief Chuck Lovell said the demonstrators also wound up targeting other people who live in Wheeler's building and have had nothing to do with the protests.

Previously, the demonstrators have almost always clashed with police outside symbols of authority - police buildings and courthouses.

'The families that live inside have done absolutely nothing to provoke a threat to their lives. As I've stated repeatedly, the nightly violence is coming at increased cost,' he said. 'This is impacting the safety of our entire city and urgent action is needed.'

Washington DC 'allowed rioters and anarchists to engage in violence'

Trump's memo says that in Washington DC, 'Mayor Muriel Bowser allowed rioters and anarchists to engage in violence and destruction in late May and early June, requiring me to call in the National Guard to maintain law and order in the Nation's Capital.'

The memo, which has reportedly been in the works for weeks, does not mention the crowds of activists who aggressively confronted attendees at the Republican National Convention last week as they returned to their hotels.

Republican Senator Rand Paul on Friday called on the FBI to investigate a crowd of protesters that swarmed him as he departed the White House after listening to Trump accept his party's nomination for re-election.

The so-called 'QAnon Shaman' has pleaded guilty to his role in the US Capitol riot, and faces up to five years in prison.

Jacob Anthony Chansley, 33, on Friday pleaded guilty to obstructing a federal proceeding. The other five counts against him were dropped and he faces sentencing on November 17.

Though the charge carries a statutory maximum 20-year prison term, federal prosecutors plan to seek a penalty between 44 months and five years, while defense attorney Albert Watkins hinted that he would argue that Chansley should be freed on time served.

Friday's hearing was briefly interrupted when the public phone line was unmuted and someone could be heard shouting, 'freedom, freedom!'

At a press conference after the hearing, defense attorney Watkins reiterated his insistence that Chansley now disavows the QAnon conspiracy theory, and said his client wants to take responsibility for his actions.

'Today Jake made a monumental step toward doing right by our nation,' said Watkins, who argued that Chansley has mental health vulnerabilities and was seduced by Donald Trump to participate in the riot.

'He had a fondness for Trump that was not unlike the first love a man may feel for a woman,' said Watkins. 'Trump was very much like his first love.'

Chansley, of Phoenix, Arizona, was photographed inside the Capitol shirtless on January 6, wearing a horned headdress and heavily tattooed. He has been held without bond since his arrest shortly after the riot.

Chansley, who became the face of the Capitol riot due to his outlandish garb, now rejects the QAnon conspiracy theory, according to his attorney

Chansley is seen in a court sketch earlier this year. On Friday pleaded guilty to obstructing a federal proceeding and faces a potential sentence of five years

At a press conference on Friday, attorney Al Watkins argued that Chansley has mental health vulnerabilities and was seduced by Donald Trump to participate in the riot

Chansley had been a supporter of the QAnon conspiracy theory that casts Trump as a savior figure and elite Democrats as a cabal of Satanist pedophiles and cannibals.

In an earlier statement, Watkins asserted that Chansley 'has repudiated the `Q´ previously assigned to him and requests future references to him be devoid of use of the letter `Q´.'

Watkins said that Chansley had faced 'a great deal of familial pressure not to take a plea' from family members who still embrace the dubious theory that Trump will resume the office of presidency imminently and pardon him.

'It was a really brave thing for him to do,' Watkins said of Chansley agreeing to plead guilty.

Watkins insisted that Chansley did not have violent or malevolent intentions when he joined the mob that stormed the Capitol.

Chansley himself was seen howling from the dias of the Senate president, where prosecutors say he wrote a threatening note to then-Vice President Mike Pence that read: 'It's Only A Matter of Time. Justice Is Coming!'

'In his heart and in his mind he was helping the president save the country,' said Watkins.

'Jacob Chansley did not have a plan...he was half naked, tattooed, on a winter day in DC,' the attorney said. 'Granted, he had the best costume of the day, he had the best look.

Prosecutors said Chansley went into the Capitol carrying a US flag attached to a wooden pole topped with a spear, ignored an officer's commands to leave, went into the Senate chamber and wrote a threatening note to then-Vice President Mike Pence

While in detention, Chansley underwent mental examinations and was diagnosed by prison officials with transient schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, depression and anxiety.

Before entering the plea, Chansley was found by a judge to be mentally competent.

His lawyer Watkins said the solitary confinement that Chansley faced for most of his time in jail has had an adverse effect on his mental health and that his time under mental evaluation in Colorado helped him regain his sharpness.

'I am very appreciative for the court's willingness to have my mental vulnerabilities examined,' Chansley said before pleading guilty to a charge of obstructing an official proceeding.

Watkins noted that prosecutors had acknowledged Chansley was 'not a planner or organizer' of the riot.

Nearly 600 people have been arrested over the attack on the Capitol where Congress was meeting to certify Joe Biden's November victory over Trump. Earlier Trump had given a fiery speech falsely claiming his defeat was the result of fraud.

Watkins argued on Friday that not everyone who participated in the mob should be painted with the 'broad brush' of being labeled an insurrectionist.

'They are our countrymen, they are our relatives, they are the guy down the street,' he said. 'But for January 6, you would have had a beer with them.'

Chansley shot to worldwide infamy when he stormed the Capitol sporting face-paint, a fur hat and holding a Star-Spangled spear

While the charge carries both a maximum 20-year prison term and a fine of up to $250,000, prosecutor Kimberly Paschall indicated the maximum sentence the government was likely to request would be much shorter.

In the months before Friday's hearing, Senior U.S. District Judge Royce Lamberth rejected multiple requests from Chansley for possible pre-trial release.

On Friday, Watkins asked the judge to allow Chansley to be released from prison pending a sentencing hearing, scheduled for November 17. The judge said he would consider this request.

In the meantime, Chansley remains in federal custody in Alexandria, Virginia.

A colorful and outspoken attorney, Watkins previously released a video that he says shows his client preventing a rioter from stealing a muffin from the U.S. Capitol on January 6, as well as a bizarre high school essay in which he describes his goals as a spiritual 'master'.

Watkins' defense motion contains a link to a YouTube video titled 'Jake Stops Muffin Stealing,' which appears to show Chansley clad in his distinctive fur-and-horns headgear yelling 'Hey, hey hey!' at a rioter entering a break room in the Capitol.

The court documents describe the video as showing Chansley 'thwarting a crime (theft) by yelling at another person in the Capitol who was attempting to steal a 'muffin' from a breakroom in the Capitol.'

Attached as an exhibit to a defense motion is an essay that Chansley wrote in high school, declaring his career choice was to be 'a Christ, a Buddha, or a Muhammad'

'It demonstrates and reinforces my client's long-standing status as a peaceful, non-violent person who sought to thwart a theft and support the need for those in the Capitol to be respectful of law enforcement,' Watkins said of the new video in a statement to DailyMail.com.

Chansley and his bulldog attorney Watkins have previously referenced the muffin theft intervention in interviews, but the new video is the first footage of the incident to emerge publicly.

'I also stopped people from stealing and vandalizing that sacred space, the Senate. Okay? I actually stopped somebody from stealing muffins out of the break room,' Chansley told 60 Minutes from behind bars in March.

'And I also said a prayer in that sacred chamber. Because it was my intention to bring divinity, and to bring God back into the Senate.'

The motion from Chansley's defense team also reveals that his spiritual aspirations emerged at an early age.

Attached as an exhibit to the motion is an essay that Chansley wrote in high school, declaring his career choice was to be 'a Christ, a Buddha, or a Muhammad, whichever you prefer to call it.'

'I chose this career because I know it is my soul's intent to get out of the illusion as well as to help others get out of the illusion,' he wrote in the 2005 essay, clarifying that by illusion he meant 'the physical world.'",QAnon Shaman Jacob Chansley pleads guilty to one felony count over Capitol riot,1

His body was displayed in an open casket for less than an hour before it was taken away again by workers to be buried at a cemetery around a mile away.

Shocking footage from inside the church showed the black-clad workers holding mourners back from the coffin as people begged to be allowed to say goodbye. Just minutes earlier, his elderly parents had been seen kneeling by its side.

Video from outside the church appeared to show that - as it became clear Navalny's coffin was being whisked away - chanting began again, this time in greater defiance of Putin: 'Russia without Putin', 'Putin is a killer' and 'We won't forget' rang out.

The funeral for Alexei Navalny today proved to be Vladimir Putin 's worst nightmare as thousands of Russian mourners gathered in Moscow to say their final farewell

Despite a heavy police presence and a warning against dissent from the Kremlin, the huge crowds chanted Navalny's name as his coffin was carried into the Russian Orthodox church on the outskirts of Moscow at around 11am GMT - in defiance of Vladimir Putin (pictured today)

As the coffin was taken away towards the cemetery, aerial shots over the Church of the Icon of the Mother of God Soothe My Sorrows, in the southeast of the capital, showed just how large the crowd had grown.

The vast mass of mourners, many carrying red flowers, began to walk towards a bridge to the south that crosses the Moskva river near the Borisov cemetery.

It appeared in the footage that police were funnelling protests onto the pavement, not allowing them to walk down the middle of the road, slowing the crowd down as it tried to follow the hearse to Navalny's final resting place.

There, several large wreaths were arranged around the grave. 'We won't forget you!' and 'Forgive us!' some mourners shouted as the coffin arrived for burial.

The scenes outside Navalny's funeral would have been Putin's worst nightmare, with Russians openly showing support for his staunchest domestic critic.

Russia is currently building up to a presidential election later this month which Putin is all but guaranteed to win.

Nevertheless, the Kremlin has been at pains to crack down on any dissent - particularly as Moscow continues to wage war in Ukraine.

Some 400 mourners have been detained at Navalny memorials since his death, rights organisation OVD-Info has said - raising fears of mass arrests today.

Pictured from outside the church suggested at least one person was arrested. It was not immediately clear what repercussions those who attended the funeral - or those who chanted against Putin - could face.

Putin ordered his secret services to prevent the funeral turning into a full-scale revolt over his leadership, according to reports.

It is claimed that Putin was fearful of a rerun of Novel-prize winning physicist Andrei Sakharov's farewell in 1989, which helped bring down the Soviet Union.

The state and loyalist media were ordered not to cover the funeral - and most Russians have not heard the claims by Navalny's family and Western leaders that Putin ordered his death.

Tens of thousands stayed after the burial to pay homage to the 'murdered' Russian opposition leader, and chant slogans backing Ukraine, opposing the war, and hostile to Putin.

The Russian special services were ordered by the worried Kremlin to carry out an 'operation' to 'protect the constitutional order from threats', reported the independent Moscow Times.

An official told the media outlet: 'The task was set to prevent a picture similar to the farewell to Sakharov.'

Hundreds of thousands had attended the funeral of Sakharov, winner of the 1975 Nobel Prize, in Moscow.

'Putin demanded that the FSB prevent a rebellion over Navalny's death,' said the outlet, citing insider sources.

The Kremlin 'held a series of meetings with senior generals of the Federal Security Service and the Ministry of Internal Affairs following the death of Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny in a colony above the Arctic Circle'

Two senior sources said Navalny's send-off 'caused unrest among the country's top leadership, despite the ostentatious self-confidence demonstrated by President Vladimir Putin'.

An official said: 'Navalny's funeral is a stress test for the Russian authorities.

'This topic was one of the most important at meetings involving Kremlin officials, FSB generals and the Ministry of Internal Affairs.'

Russian police detained at least 45 people across the country today - the day of the funeral - according to rights monitoring group OVO-Info. It is not known how many of these are linked to Navalny's death.

The organisation reported: 'OVD-Info is aware of more than 45 detentions. Most people - 18 of them - were detained in Novosibirsk,', adding six had been detained in Moscow, where large crowds came out to pay their respects.

Navalny's mother Lyudmila remained at the grave for three hours after her son was lowered into the ground.

People were permitted to lay flowers at the grave, yet the atmosphere was tense, with the authorities blocking mobile phone signals.

Mourners used flashlights to signal their support for Navalny, and some chanted 'Ukrainians are good people' - normally unthinkable defiance against brutal dictator Putin.

They called out: 'Bring the soldiers home.'

Earlier Navalny was buried to the music of Frank Sinatra's My Way, and Terminator 2.

In the build up to Friday's service, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said: 'Any unauthorised gatherings will be in violation of the law and those who participate in them will be held responsible,' according to TASS news agency.

'What are they afraid of? Why so many cars?' one mourner, Anna Stepanova, told AFP news agency outside the church as people waited for Navalny's coffin to arrive.

'They are so afraid themselves. The people who came here, they are not scared. Alexei wasn't either. 'People like him shouldn't be dying: honest and principled, willing to sacrifice themselves,' she added.

Another said: 'I feel this is a funeral for the Russia that might have been.'

One woman, who flew 900 miles from Perm to Moscow said: 'I had high hopes for this man, he was very strong, very brave.

'I would like to see people today who also support him. The pain in my heart is such that I cannot describe it - so hard,' she added.

Another woman added: 'For us it was hope for a brighter future, not for North Korea. This is the only thing we can do now is to pay tribute to the memory, keep it.

'A person lives as long as we remember him. We need to remember why he got there. For us, for everyone. And of course continue, don't give up, as he asked.'

The French, German and US ambassadors were seen among mourners outside the church, as were some of Russia's last free independent politicians.

The dissident's widow, Yulia Navalnaya, earlier said she feared the funeral could be disrupted by further arrests.

'I'm not sure yet whether it will be peaceful or whether the police will arrest those who have come to say goodbye to my husband,' Navalnaya told the European Parliament this week.

Navalnaya has blamed Putin for her husband's death.

Putin's spokesman Peskov has criticised the accusations made by her and some Western leaders as 'vulgar'.

On the day of the funeral, Peskov said he had 'nothing to say' to the family of the deceased. Putin himself has not publicly commented on Navalny's death.

Navalny shot to prominence through his anti-corruption campaigning, exposing what he said was rampant graft at the top of Putin's administration.

Some mourners mentioned the huge influence Navalny had on their own political activism.

'Because of him I began to get involved in politics... He was the first public person that I listened to,' said 26-year-old Denis, a volunteer at a charity.

Navalny was arrested in January 2021 when he returned to Russia after being treated in Germany for a poisoning attack likely carried out by the Kremlin.

'Alexei was tortured for three years,' Navalnaya told lawmakers in Brussels.

'He was starved in a tiny stone cell, cut off from the outside world and denied visits, phone calls, and then even letters.'

'And then they killed him. Even after that, they abused his body,' she said.

His body was held in a morgue for eight days before being returned to the family, which Navalny's team believed to be a bid to cover up responsibility for his death.

His family and his team have also accused authorities of trying to prevent a dignified public burial, fearing it could turn into a flashpoint for dissent.

Navalny's team said local investigators had threatened to bury him on the prison grounds if his mother did not agree to a 'secret' funeral.

Once the body was released, allies struggled to find a place that would agree to hold a funeral ceremony, as well as hearse drivers.

And a civil ceremony allowing the general public to pay their respects to the body - common in Russia - has not been allowed.

Navalnaya has vowed to continue his life's work and urged to 'fight more desperately, more fiercely than before.'

In the crowd near the church, some seemed to agree.

'A person has died, but his ideas will live on thanks to those who have gathered here,' said Alyona, a 22-year-old archaeologist who came to pay her respects.","Putin's worst nightmare: Even in death, Alexei Navalny proves to be Vladimir's nemesis as huge crowds chant 'Russia without Putin' and 'Putin is a killer' during funeral in greatest challenge to Vladimir in years",1

Tory grandee Sir Bernard Jenkin says he told the PM yesterday: ‘You can go with some dignity or you can be forced out like Donald Trump’.

The intervention from Sir Bernard comes as the Prime Minister has refused to resign despite a staggering 53 Governmental resignations in just over two days - triggered by Chancellor Rishi Sunak and Health Secretary Sajid Javid quitting on Tuesday night.

Veteran Tory MP Sir Bernard even urged Carrie Johnson to step in a convince her husband that he should throw in the towel.

Prime Minister Boris Johnson (pictured today) is being bombarded with more resignations but has refused to quit

Mr Johnson's personal approval rating has even dipped below Mr Trump's low point around the time of the Capitol riot on January 6, 2022

According to YouGov, just 23 per cent of voters approve of Mr Johnson - with the figure likely to fall further still after a chaotic week in No.10 -

Conservative MP Sir Bernard Jenkin, who chairs the Commons Liaison Committee, spoke to BBC Radio 4's Today programme this morning.

‘There’s no question it’s over for Boris Johnson as Prime Minster and I went to tell him that at lunchtime yesterday after Prime Minister’s Questions.

‘There are three ways a prime minister can be removed; one is his government falls apart - and that’s happening, but it’s astonishing he hasn’t got the message from that.

‘Second; the bigger vote of confidence in the Conservative Party to remove him as leader and he would have to go.’

‘And ultimately, there could be a vote of confidence in the House of Commons and I don’t think he would want to bring it to that.

'I just said to him, look, it’s just when you go now and it’s how you go. You can go with some dignity or you can be forced out like Donald Trump clinging to power and pretending he’s won the election when he’s lost.

‘I hope he’ll go today – he really must go today. I mean the reason why - I wasn’t at the 1922 executive yesterday – but the reason why I think they decided not to change the rules… first of all, we’re due a re-election; but the second reason is well surely he’s just going to go. Surely he sees the writing on the wall. I mean it’s got a kind of Macbeth-like quality at the moment. Birnam wood will never come to Dunsinane, and I am not of woman born.’

Former Cabinet minister Julian Smith also warned that the premier had seen how Donald Trump behaved in relation to the Capitol riots after the US election, and was looking to have a 'mini version in the UK'.

Mr Johnson's personal approval rating has even dipped below Mr Trump's low point around the time of the Capitol riot on January 6, 2022.

According to YouGov, just 23 per cent of voters approve of Mr Johnson - with the figure likely to fall further still after a chaotic week in No.10.

Mr Trump's personal approval rating hit a low as he left office after the January 6 Capitol riot - languishing at a meagre 34 per cent, according to Gallup.

Mr Trump refused to admit that he lost the 2020 Presidential election to Joe Biden in months of delusional ramblings which culminated in his supporters storming the US Capitol building as Congress were trying to certify the Electoral College result.

Mr Johnson bizarrely sacked Levelling Up Secretary Michael Gove yesterday - after a delegation of Cabinet colleagues had entered No.10 in order to try and convince the Prime Minister to resign.

The PM has vowed defiance on multiple occasions yesterday - a stand which shows no signs of abating despite more Government resignations today.

Deputy PM Dominic Raab is thought to have told the Prime Minister that he risked putting the monarch in an intolerable position if he tried to call a snap election, The Sun reports.

The Queen, 96, was yesterday pictured being driven from Wood Farm near Sandringham, Norfolk, to her helicopter which flew her back to Windsor Castle.

She typically holds a weekly meeting with the Prime Minister on Wednesdays, which have frequently taken place over the phone since the coronavirus pandemic broke out, but it is not clear whether it occurred yesterday amid the pandemonium surrounding Mr Johnson's leadership.

Concern among MPs comes following the approval of the Dissolution and Calling of Parliament Act which was brought into law this year, repealing the Fixed-term Parliaments Act and allowing for the body to be dissolved by the Queen 'on the request of the prime minister'.

Conservative MPs worry that the Prime Minister could try to use it to save his premiership.

Constitutional experts have branded the 'nuclear option' of asking the Queen for a dissolution 'deluded madness' which would spark a crisis as the monarch would be obliged to turned down his request.

The Prime Minister rejected calls to quit on Wednesday and dramatically sacked Cabinet rival Michael Gove, but was later hit with the departure of a third Cabinet minister - Welsh Secretary Simon Hart - and further demands to go from the Attorney General

Boris Johnson's allies have now raised the prospect of taking the 'nuclear option' and asking the Queen to dissolve parliament to trigger an election - which he does technically have the power to do - but the monarch could also refuse the request

The exodus of ministers continues 6.47am: Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis - tweeted that he could not longer continue without 'honesty, integrity and mutual respect'. 6.49am: Treasury minister Helen Whately - said 'there are only so many times you can apologise and move on'. 7.15am: Security minister Damian Hinds - 'for our country, and trust in our democracy, we must have a change of leadership' 7.21am: Science minister George Freeman - accused Mr Johnson of 'insults to the Conservatism I believe in and stand for'. 7.50am: Pensions minister Guy Opperman - 'it should not take the resignation of 50 colleagues, but sadly the PM has left us no choice' 8.02am: Technology minister Chris Philp - 'the PM should step down'. 8.09am: Courts minister James Cartlidge - 'The position is clearly untenable.' 8.59am: Education Secretary Michelle Donelan resigns after just 36 hours Advertisement

Under the UK's uncodified constitution and the so-called 'Lascelles Principles', the Queen would not be obliged to dissolve Parliament if a Conservative MP is able to command the confidence of a majority of the House of Commons.

Despite the UK being a parliamentary democracy, Mr Johnson claimed to have a presidential-style personal mandate from the last election, apparently saying: 'If the party wants to overthrow the elected will of the people, they have to dip their hands in blood.'

Supporters are fleeing the PM as the resignation tally now stands at 54 following the resignation of Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis and six others this morning.

At 6.47am, he tweeted that he could not longer continue without 'honesty, integrity and mutual respect'. Minutes later Treasury minister Helen Whately followed suit saying 'there are only so many times you can apologise and move on'. Security minister Damian Hinds and science minister George Freeman had followed by 7.30am, and pensions minister Guy Opperman by 7.50am.

Meanwhile, Wales minister David TC Davies publicly announced that he had refused a promotion to take over from Welsh Secretary Simon Hart, who quit last night. The Attorney General, Suella Braverman has called for Mr Johnson to resign and said she is only staying in place to keep the government functioning.

The government has been unable to find a minister willing to go on the airwaves to speak up for the PM this morning - although his critics have been swarming to studios.

The Prime Minister now faces the ignominy of a second vote of no confidence by his own party after the 1922 Committee elections on Monday.

Mr Johnson narrowly won a confidence vote earlier this year and is nominally protected from another under party rules for 12 months - but the next executive of the backbench Tory committee is likely to scrap this rule to remove the Prime Minister.",Tories compare Boris's refusal to leave office to Trump's attempt to cling to power,1

But ever since Russian tanks rolled across the border and into Ukraine on February 24, 2022, the role of state media channels and Kremlin press representatives in shaping public opinion of warmongering president Vladimir Putin has been more important than ever.

Moscow enjoys near total control of the media landscape, with all of Russia's largest newspapers and broadcasters either fully or partially funded by the state.

This has allowed Putin to enlist a team of hand-picked propagandists, beaming into television sets, phone screens and inboxes across Russia to whip up support for his 'special military operation'.

Here, MailOnline takes a closer look at the leading figures tasked with indoctrinating Russian citizens and cultivating loyalty to the Kremlin as their armed forces continue to rain missiles down on Ukraine.

Vladimir Putin has enlisted a team of propagandists to cultivate support for his so-called 'special military operation' in Ukraine and ensure the country remains loyal to the Kremlin

Vladimir Solovyov

Vladimir Solovyov is one of the most recognisable faces on Russian television - and arguably Putin's most outspoken mainstream propagandist.

He marked himself out as one of the despot's darlings in 2018 when he hosted a weekly show named 'Moscow, Kremlin, Putin' which offered a roundup of all the great and good performed by the Russian president across the country each week.

But his broadcasts, which typically feature rambling monologues interspersed with fiery panel discussions, have become increasingly hawkish since Putin launched the invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.

Solovyov, 59, gained worldwide notoriety thanks to countless outbursts on his nightly talk show 'Evening with Vladimir Solovyov', in which he regularly unleashes tirades about how Russia should wipe out its enemies with devastating attacks.

He has threatened Ukraine's Western allies with nuclear warfare, famously declaring that 'London will turn to dust and burn in hell', and has called for Putin to 'plunge Ukraine into the dark ages', earning the moniker 'Putin's voice' for his unwavering allegiance to the Kremlin.

But Solovyov's past belies his stature as a true Putin fanatic.

Vladimir Solovyov is one of the most recognisable faces on Russian television - and arguably Putin's most outspoken mainstream propagandist

TV presenter Vladimir Solovyov receives the Order of Honour from president Vladimir Putin in 2013

In 2008, the man who now routinely calls for the bombing of Ukraine stood on stage and delivered a passionate speech to a packed audience in which he claimed that 'there will never be a war between Russia and Ukraine, and anyone who commits such an act is a criminal'.

He described the people of Ukraine as 'fraternal in spirit, blood and common history' and declared that a war with them would be 'the worst crime you could think of'.

It is possible that Solovyov has since undergone a radical ideological transformation and now believes Russia must conquer Ukraine.

But others believe he simply sold his soul for a handsome pay packet and to avoid being marginalised or persecuted under Putin's regime.

Olga Skabeyeva and Yevgeny Popov

Dubbed Putin's 'Iron Doll' for her steely looks and hardline stance on the war in Ukraine, Olga Skabeyeva stands alongside Solovyov as one of the most prominent figures in Russia's state-controlled media.

But perhaps unlike Solovyov, Skabeyeva appears to be a true believer in the Kremlin and a staunch follower of Putin and his regime.

The 38-year-old broadcaster is a lifelong journalist, having studied at the Faculty of Journalism at Saint Petersburg State University from which she graduated with honours in 2008 before quickly rising through the ranks of Russian state media.

Along with her husband Yevgeny Popov, 44, Skabeyeva has spread baseless conspiracy theories, overstated Moscow's war successes, parroted Kremlin lies about 'Nazis' in Ukraine and issued dire warnings of World War Three and threats against the West.

Skabeyeva first rose to prominence in 2012 and 2013 for her coverage of the Pussy Riot trials and the ensuing criminal investigation into Russian opposition groups, taking a strong pro-Kremlin stance.

Then in 2018, she was a linchpin in Moscow's campaign to discredit the British investigation into the Novichok nerve agent poisoning of Sergei and Yulia Skripal in Salisbury.

Sergei Skripal was a former Russian military officer and double agent for the British intelligence agencies, and it is widely accepted that Russian agents were commanded to assassinate him on British soil.

But Skabeyeva insisted the case was nothing more than 'an elaborate British plot to smear Russia'.

Skabeyeva poses outside the Kremlin

Russian propagandist couple Yevgeny Popov and Olga Skabeyeva

Yevgeny Popov regularly appears as a panellist on the '60 minutes' talk show hosted by his wife Olga Skabeyeva

Skabeyeva's talk show '60 minutes' - first launched in 2016 - is now one of Russia's leading news segments and acts as a platform for various nationalist to spit venom and call for the destruction of Ukraine.

Putin's 'Iron Doll' is the show's leading presenter, while Popov appears on a regular basis as an in-house panellist.

The programme has alleged that Malaysian Airlines flight MH17 - widely understood to have been shot down by a Buk surface-to-air missile launched from pro-Russian separatist-controlled territory in Ukraine - was actually destroyed by a Ukrainian jet.

It has also claimed that genocide has been carried out in Ukraine's eastern Donbas region against Russian speakers - a lie that the Kremlin has pushed in order to justify Putin's brutal and illegal invasion.

Skabeyeva and Popov are proof that allying with Putin pays - the pair rank among Russia's richest propagandists whose fortune was estimated at around £4 million in 2021, despite their combined yearly media salaries supposedly totalling just over £200,000.

Their fortune was unveiled in an investigation carried out by the Anti-Corruption Foundation (FBK) founded by jailed opposition figure Alexei Navalny, highlighting that much of their vast wealth is unexplained.

Margarita Simonyan

Margarita Simonyan is the editor-in-chief of Russia Today (RT), a state-funded news network that has not only become one of the country's most successful domestic media outlets, but until the war in Ukraine had considerable international exposure.

Simonyan, 43, was born in the southern city of Krasnodar in 1980 and like Skabeyeva is a lifelong journalist who throughout the early 2000s earned plaudits for her gritty, on the ground coverage of the Second Chechen War and the Beslan school hostage crisis in Russia's southern Caucasus region.

Her journalistic exploits and allegiance to the Kremlin saw her become one of Putin's favourites and she skyrocketed to the top at an early age when she was appointed editor-in-chief of RT upon its creation in 2005.

At just 25, Simonyan commanded a newsroom of hundreds of journalists, but under her guidance the organisation thrived as she set about portraying RT as a moderate alternative to more overtly pro-Kremlin media.

Despite criticism, RT was able to build up a significant English language operation - it became a mainstay in the British media landscape and was for a time accepted as one of the few Russian media organisations not blatantly spouting the Kremlin's official lines.

But the war in Ukraine saw Simonyan change her tack, and RT's coverage quickly transformed from news with a Russian spin to all-out Putin-approved propaganda.

Simonyan has since gone on to allege that Russia is not actually at war with Ukraine and is instead battling against the West, accusing Ukrainians of 'treason' in siding with NATO over Moscow.

She has also made her reverence of Putin clear, claiming that every meeting she shares with him is like 'a psychotherapy session'.

Simonyan is one of Putin's favourite shills - but has set a limit on the venomous content she allows on her platform. Last year she suspended one of her RT directors who said live on air that Ukrainian children should be drowned

However, Simonyan has proven herself to be somewhat more restrained than the likes of Solovyov and Skabeyeva who have openly called for the destruction of Ukrainian people.

Late last year, she suspended one of her directors at RT, Anton Krasovsky, after he declared that Ukrainian children should be exterminated via drowning and burning during a live broadcast.

'Perhaps Anton will explain what kind of temporary insanity it was caused and how it broke from his tongue,' Simonyan tweeted.

'It is hard to believe that Krasovsky sincerely believed that children should be drowned.

'For now, I'm stopping our collaboration, as neither I nor the rest of the RT team can afford to even think that any of us are capable of sharing such sentiments.'

Krasovsky later apologised to Simonyan - but never retracted his comments.

Dmitry Peskov and Maria Zakharova

While the likes of Solovyov, Skabeyeva and Popov are tasked with the mass indoctrination of the Russian people via news and entertainment media, Dmitry Peskov and Maria Zakharova serve Putin from within the Kremlin as his loyal mouthpieces.

Peskov, 55, is Putin's long-serving press secretary, and for all intents and purposes is the despot's primary representative responsible for communicating Putin's thoughts to the media and the public.

He has worked directly for Putin since 2008, and as such is tasked with invariably supporting and justifying every statement, action and decree given by the President, including his suppression of political opponents, erosion of democracy and, of course, the brutal war in Ukraine.

Peskov is known for his calm and measured demeanour, seemingly able to absorb criticism and inquiries from abroad - though he is often criticised for not providing substantive answers to journalists' questions, and has a habit of making serious statements that court more controversy.

His disdain for anti-Kremlin activities is well documented and he has on several occasions called for Russian police to beat protesters.

In recent months, one of the most challenging tasks for Peskov has been to dispel rumours about President Putin's health.

The press secretary frequently deflects and denies inquiries into the state of his boss' physical shape, particularly with regard to reports that claim he is battling Parkinson's or cancer and uses body doubles for public appearances.

Jailed Putin foe Navalny claims Peskov's loyal service to Putin sees him handsomely rewarded far beyond his state-declared salary.

In 2015, for example, he was pictured wearing a luxurious gold watch thought to be worth around £600,000, despite officially being paid less than £150,000 a year at the time.

Maria Zakharova is considered Putin's propagandist-in-chief over Ukraine, having occupied the position of Director of the Information and Press Department for Russia's foreign ministry since 2015

Zakharova meanwhile is considered Putin's propagandist-in-chief over Ukraine, having occupied the position of Director of the Information and Press Department for Russia's foreign ministry since 2015.

While Peskov represents Putin directly, the 47-year-old Zakharova controls Moscow's distribution of information across all aspects of foreign policy, up to including its clashes with Kyiv and the West.

She once described Russian annexed Crimea as an 'unloved child', claiming the peninsula was not forced to join Russia but instead 'got up and left by itself like a stepson leaving a family where he was never loved'.

And earlier this year she accused Britain of 'facilitating genocide' of Russian speakers by sending depleted uranium tank ammunition to Kyiv.

'The use of ammunition with depleted uranium is a manifestation of genocide of the population against which it is used and the people who use them,' she declared - conveniently leaving out that depleted uranium cannot be used to manufacture any kind of nuclear device and has also been used by Russia.

US think tank Institute for the Study of War said Zakharova was framing the 'provision of depleted uranium ammunition to Ukraine as a significant escalation in order to bolster Russia's information operations' and was looking 'to place the onus for negotiations on the West'.

Prominent personalities… and selfies with Elon Musk

Almost all of Russia's media is controlled by the state, so there is no shortage of media personalities peddling Putin's propaganda on the airwaves.

Dmitry Kiselyov, 69, is among Russia's most vocal propagandists and occupies several top positions in Moscow's media landscape.

He was already working as a correspondent for the Vremya news service in the Soviet Union in the 80s, and is now the CEO of Rossiya Segodnya and the deputy director of VGTRK - the All-Russia State Television and Radio Broadcasting Company.

But despite his lofty position, Kiselyov remains eager to get in front of the camera and is a regular contributor to the Russia-1 channel, often appearing in panel shows hosted by Solovyov and Skabeyeva.

Meanwhile, prominent radio and television host Anna Shafran has been described as the 'female version of Vladimir Solovyov' for her hardline views.

The pair have worked together on several projects, co-hosting the 'Full Contact' morning talk show, and Shafran is a regular guest on Solovyov's debate show 'Who is against?'

Aside from her work with Solovyev, Shafran hosts several of her own divisive talk shows and is known for her outspoken condemnation of Ukrainian, Western and Russian opposition groups.

Finally, Nailya Asker-Zade, a host at VGTRK, has been marked out as one of Russian media's rising stars.

Born in Azerbaijan, Asker-Zade was chosen in 2021 to host the annual 'Direct Line' event - a marathon live Q&A session which sees Putin spend hours fielding questions from members of the public but has been cancelled ever since the invasion of Ukraine.

She is also believed to be in a relationship with Andrey Kostin, a chairman at Russia's VTB bank who has been described as Vladimir Putin's private banker.

Yesterday the Times reported a call on 10 January, in which McCarthy said he thought Trump should resign over the January 6 Capitol riot. McCarthy denied it, whereupon the two Times reporters involved released the tape. The Times now says that on 11 January the House minority leader told Republican lawmakers Trump acknowledged some responsibility for the attack on Congress.

McCarthy is quoted as saying: Let me be very clear to all of you, and I have been very clear to the president: he bears responsibilities for his words and actions … No if, ands or buts. “I asked him personally today, does he hold responsibility for what happened? … Does he feel bad about what happened? He told me he does have some responsibility for what happened and he’d need to acknowledge that.” Trump has not publicly admitted responsibility for the deadly attack, to which a bipartisan Senate committee linked seven deaths and over which around 800 people have been charged. Trump has not yet commented on McCarthy’s taped comments in the 10 January call. He did not comment immediately on the new report from the Times. Most observers think McCarthy’s future – and his ambitions to be House speaker should Republicans take control in the midterm elections this year – depends on which way Trump jumps in response to the minority leader’s current (and evidently growing) woes.

22 Apr 2022 21.17 BST Closing summary Catch your breath everyone, we’ve reached the closing point of the US politics blog for the day, and indeed the week. It was an uncomfortable day for Kevin McCarthy, the Republican House minority leader caught on audio (twice) with comments uncomplimentary to the former president Donald Trump in the wake of the 6 January Capitol insurrection. Trump’s response, when it comes, could be central to McCarthy’s survival in his role. Join us again on Monday for what promises to be another lively week, especially as the US House and Senate return to business after the Easter recess and the 6 January House inquiry picks up steam.

22 Apr 2022 20.59 BST Florida’s Ron DeSantis has closed out an eventful week by signing two of his flagship “culture war” laws into effect, one abolishing Disney’s half-century old right to self-governance, and another outlawing companies from espousing what he calls “woke” ideology over race. At a signing ceremony Friday afternoon in Tallahassee, the Republican governor and likely candidate for the party’s 2024 presidential nomination blasted corporations such as Google and Disney that he insists are teaching employees to believe Americans are inherently racist. “Under this law, that is a violation of your civil rights,” DeSantis told the vastly white, completely unmasked crowd to cheers, referring to the “anti-critical race theory” legislation.

The new Disney law, and DeSantis’s congressional map gerrymandering boundaries to reduce Black voting power and increase Florida’s Republican representation in Washington DC, were rushed through by lawmakers in a special session called by the governor this week.

Photograph: Gaelen Morse/Reuters “I think there are so many reasons I was wrong about Trump, but I’m happy that I was wrong about Trump,” Vance said in a phone interview (he once said Donald Trump could be “America’s Hitler”). “Something our voters respond to on the campaign trail is being told the truth. ‘Yeah I had one beef six years ago and I have a different view today, this is why it changed’, is a hell of lot better than trying to pretend that you didn’t say something you said.” Vance, the bestselling author of the memoir Hillbilly Elegy, faces an uphill battle in a crowded race. According to the RealClearPolitics.com average a week ago, Josh Mandel held a 1.7-point lead over Mike Gibbons, with Vance in third. Polling day is 3 May. Vance, however, is optimistic that he can win with Trump’s support. “Like some others, JD Vance may have said some not so great things about me in the past, but he gets it now, and I have seen that in spades,” Trump said. “He is our best chance for victory.” Share Updated at 20.30 BST

22 Apr 2022 20.14 BST Towards the end of his climate address, Biden veered off script to take a shot at Republicans, and the tape scandal engulfing the House minority leader Kevin McCarthy today. This ain’t your father’s Republican party. All you got to do is look at what’s being played out this morning, the tape that was released... This is the Maga [make America great again] party now. You got the senator from Texas and others, these guys are a different breed of cat. They’re not like those I served with for so many years, and the people who know better are afraid to act better because they know they’ll be primaried. They come to me and say: ‘Joe, I want to be with you on such and such but I can’t because I’ll be primaried, I’ll lose my race’. Folks, this has got to start to change.

22 Apr 2022 20.01 BST Biden also celebrated the US return to the Paris climate agreement that Trump rejected: We convened last year with 40 leaders around the globe, reasserting America’s leadership on climate after four years of an administration denying there was a crisis, denying there was any need to do anything about it. Last year the US deployed the most solar wind and battery storage in American history, we made record investments in energy in rural America. We’re investing in technology so you can heat and cool your home when the sun doesn’t shine and the wind doesn’t blow. And by the way, windmills don’t cause cancer [another dig at Trump]. As for clean vehicles, Biden admitted: “I have a 1968 Corvette that does nothing but pollute the air. I don’t drive it very much.” He said he would be first in the queue for an electric Corvette, and praised the American automobile industry for its commitment to sell at least 50% electric vehicles (EV) by 2030 - “I didn’t make it, they made it,” Biden said - and touted their $100bn investment in EV standards. There will be 500,000 charging stations, and fleets of electric school buses to eliminate diesel vehicles “which pollute the air and pollute the lungs”, he added. Share

22 Apr 2022 19.41 BST The answer to solving the climate crisis, Joe Biden says, lies with youth: A new generation of Americans [is] helping us lead the way against the threat of climate change. And every time I get a bit down I just turn on the television or take a look at all the young people. This young generation is not going to put up with a lot of this stuff. They are really, really energized. Whether it’s basic human rights or it’s the environment, they’re just not stopping. And from day one of my administration we’ve stood with them. Without giving specific details, Biden said that every vehicle in the US military “is going to be climate friendly”. And then he turned to his so-called green agenda, and plans to reduce the consumption of fossil fuels. My view on this crisis is as an opportunity to do things we wanted to do, and only now have become so apparent. One of the things I’m proudest of in our administration before I got into my ‘green agenda’, I got all the unions together. Starting with the IBEW electrical workers, they endorsed it and every union is stepped up because they figured it out.

They’re the ones who can help us transition like never before. It’s not going to cost them jobs. It’s going to increase jobs. The IBEW is going to be building 50,000 electric [vehicle] charging stations all across America. Share Updated at 19.43 BST

22 Apr 2022 19.25 BST Biden: Deforestation worsening climate emergency Joe Biden, in an Earth Day address in Washington state, has said the climate crisis is now so obvious that world must take immediate action to help solve it. We’re at one of those moments in world history, and in American history, where we’ve reached the point that the crisis on the environment has become so obvious, with the notable exception of the former president, that we we really have an opportunity to do things we couldn’t have done five or 10 years ago. The president was speaking in Seattle, where he signing an executive order intended to safeguard the nation’s natural forests, and strengthen reforestation. The loss of the world’s forests, he said, is contributing to the climate emergency. “All around the country there used to be a hell of lot more forests like this,” he said, showing trees behind him, and calling forests “our natural wonders”. “But we’re doing everything we can.” The dig at Donald Trump was possibly a reference to the former president’s much ridiculed stance on forestation, and his assertion that wildfires could be eliminated by raking up fallen leaves.

22 Apr 2022 18.19 BST Bad news for Joe Biden in a new Gallup poll, which puts his approval rating at 41.3% and notes: “From a historical perspective, Biden’s fifth quarter average is lower than that of any prior elected president, except Donald Trump. Trump, need I remind anyone, became a one-term president when Biden beat him in 2020. Not that Trump will admit defeat. (Although he will, sort of.) “Trump averaged 39.1% during his fifth quarter,” Gallup adds. “Although their fifth-quarter average approval ratings were at least five percentage points higher than Biden’s, Jimmy Carter, Ronald Reagan and Barack Obama join Trump and Biden in averaging less than majority approval at this stage of their presidencies.” Gallup also says the signs are not good for Biden mounting the sort of climb in the ratings which could help Democrats in the midterm elections in November, “not only because of the historical record for second-year presidents, but because his approval ratings have been stuck in the low 40s for eight months. “Even if they improve, they would have to do so by at least 10 points to be in the 50% range historically associated with the president’s party avoiding big seat losses.” Share

It comes as police attempted to disperse protesters in Myanmar's two biggest cities on Friday by firing stun grenades, rubber bullets and guns into the air in a crackdown on weeks of demonstrations that have challenged the army's bid to re-impose its rule.

At least one person was wounded in the protests in the main city of Yangon, a witness said.

It is energising some students and academics but putting others on edge, for the drums are the accompaniment to ceaseless chants about the virtues of the Palestinian cause and the wickedness of ‘colonial’ Israel.

Protesters insist they are demanding only peace in Gaza and an end to the humanitarian crisis there, and complain that anti-Zionism shouldn’t be confused with anti-Semitism. However, many of the slogans and placards tell a very different story: ‘Brick by brick, wall by wall, Israel will fall’; ‘There is only one solution, intifada revolution’; ‘From the river to the sea, Palestine will be free’ and ‘By any means necessary’.

They call, implicitly or explicitly, for the extinction of Israel.

There have been more than 700 arrests by police breaking up the protests, which have this week spread like wildfire across the US to at least 76 other universities and rising. Many say America is witnessing a crisis in academia that has been years in the making – and might yet spread to the UK.

Pro-Palestinian protesters have launched a wave of protests on campus condemning Israel's offensive on the Gaza Strip, including at New York University

Political alarm has reached the White House, where Joe Biden called on Americans to condemn the ‘alarming surge of anti-Semitism’ on college campuses and elsewhere.

Yet student protests are growing, feeding off each other. Every time police arrive on a campus to end an illegal protest, three or four more sprout up in response at universities elsewhere. It is rapidly becoming a nationwide movement and drawing comparisons with the Vietnam War protests more than 50 years ago.

Critics say that American university chiefs are reaping the whirlwind of years of pandering to woke Left-wing students with whom they frequently agree and, in the specific case of Gaza, losing their moral authority by failing to come down hard on anti-Jewish hate speech when the conflict first erupted. They’re also accused of indoctrinating students to believe that Jews are white and therefore oppressors, while Israel is a colonialist state and therefore illegitimate.

And while protest sympathisers insist the students are simply exercising their rights to free speech, others counter that by disrupting classes with loudhailers and inflammatory chants, and refusing to stop until their anti-Israel demands are met, this is simply a crude exercise in coercion and intimidation.

The situation is so serious at Columbia – an Ivy League institution founded under George II which was originally named King’s College – that a campus rabbi has urged Jewish students to stay at home rather than risk being harassed and abused.

Minouche Shafik, who is the president of Columbia University, told Congress that she was fighting anti-Semitism on her campus

Earlier this month, Columbia’s embattled President, Minouche Shafik, an Egyptian-born Anglo-American and former deputy governor of the Bank of England, told Congress that she was fighting anti-Semitism on her campus. She said several Columbia academics were already under investigation, including Middle Eastern Studies professor Joseph Massad who caused outrage when he described aspects of the October Hamas attack on Israel as ‘awesome’.

A senior colleague of hers at Columbia, Claire Shipman, testified bluntly: ‘We have a moral crisis on our campus.’

Following the Congress hearing, Baroness Shafik – also a former vice-chancellor of the LSE – returned to New York and called in the police after students had been filmed expressing anti-Semitic abuse and support for Hamas.

Officers in riot gear made more than 100 arrests as they cleared a large tented camp on the university’s lawn that protesters have called the ‘Gaza Solidarity Encampment’ and had been set up in breach of Columbia’s demonstration rules. Undaunted, protesters responded by rebuilding the encampment, only bigger, and have vowed they won’t disperse until Columbia agrees, among other demands, to cut academic and financial ties with Israel. Columbia has pledged it won’t use the police again after its university board accused Baroness Shafik of heavy-handedness.

But some of Columbia’s 5,000 Jewish students say they’ve been targeted, vocally and even physically, by the protesters, some of them troublemakers not even connected to the university.

The victims say that simply wearing a Jewish star on their clothing has been enough for demonstrators – many hiding their faces behind keffiyeh scarves – to throw liquids at them and scream in their face. One photographed a protester holding up a sign in front of Jewish students that referred to an armed wing of Hamas and read: ‘Al-Qassam’s next targets’.

And such is the sulphurous state of higher education and the fierce cultural wars being waged at universities that abuse, harassment and protests at Columbia – traditionally a hotbed of student activism with large numbers of both Jewish and Arab students - is rapidly being replicated dozens of times over.

At Yale, where pro-Palestinian protesters have turned part of its campus into a ‘Liberated Zone’, second-year student Sahar Tartak says she and a friend were hounded at a protest there after being identified as ‘visibly Orthodox Jewish students’.

She was treated in hospital after a demonstrator waved a Palestinian flag in her face, jabbing her in the eye. ‘It’s really painful to realise your peers have joined the Nazi Party,’ she said.

Riot police have arrested hundreds more protesters at universities including Yale, New York, Princeton, Southern California, the University of Texas at Austin, and Emerson in Boston after they all set up their own Gaza encampments in solidarity with their Columbia brethren.

‘BPD, KKK, IDF they’re all the same,’ chanted protesters at Emerson – lumping together the Boston Police Department and the Ku Klux Klan with the Israeli Defence Force military - as more than a hundred, including two professors, were loaded into police vans. At Emory in Atlanta, police used chemical irritants and, in one instance, a stun gun on protesters.

Student encampments have also appeared at Harvard, the University of California in Berkeley, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), and myriad other well-heeled private universities.

Some have pointed out that the encampments are for the most part cropping up on the smartest campuses whose wealthy students often have the luxury of not needing to hurry off after classes to a part time job.

Detractors have also ridiculed the way the protesters and their supporters on the Left, after years in which conservative voices have been relentlessly silenced on campuses, are only now complaining about preserving free speech in universities.

And, of course, it’s not just the students who are up in arms. Faculty members and lecturers are showing solidarity with the demonstrators. At Columbia, they have even donned ‘Hands Off Our Students’ T-shirts.

Columbia’s Baroness Shafik, an Oxford-educated former permanent secretary at the UK’s Department for International Development, faces calls from both Republicans and Democrats in Congress to step down over what they say is her failure to restore order and protect Jewish students and the faculty itself.

A sign placed near the 'solidarity encampment’ at Columbia University, where students are protesting in support of Palestinians during the conflict between Israel and Hamas

Democrat Senator John Fetterman went so far as to compare the situation at Columbia to the 2017 Unite the Right rally by white supremacists in Charlottesville, Virginia, at which a supporter drove his car into counter-protesters, killing one and injuring 35 others.

House Speaker Mike Johnson, a senior Republican, also called on Baroness Shafik to resign ‘if she cannot immediately bring order to this chaos’ when he visited Columbia on Wednesday. ‘Go back to class and stop the nonsense,’ he told protesters. ‘Stop wasting your parents’ money.’

Perhaps more serious for universities than political condemnation has been the displeasure of financial donors. Private US universities – especially the immensely rich Ivy League elite – are about nothing if not making money and Columbia has now lost the confidence of at least one of its biggest donors.

Robert Kraft, a billionaire Jewish businessman and owner of the New England Patriots football team, has given millions of dollars to the alma mater he says he ‘loves so much’. But now he has ‘lost faith’ in the university and can no longer support it ‘until corrective action is taken’, he said.

Mr Kraft, who set up a foundation to fight anti-Semitism, went on: ‘I am deeply saddened at the virulent hate that continues to grow on campus and throughout our country.’

Kraft’s horror echoes that of alumni benefactors of other ‘Ivies’ who last December helped force out the heads of Harvard and Pennsylvania after they caused widespread revulsion when, questioned in Congress, they said students who called for Jewish genocide wouldn’t necessarily be reprimanded.

Back at Columbia, Baroness Shafik has complained that the ‘tensions have been exploited and amplified’ by non-Columbia activists who have ‘come to campus to pursue their own agendas’.

Certainly, her university allowed in a string of controversial pro-Palestine speakers last week to address the protesters.

Students at Columbia University demonstrated near the Gaza Solidarity Encampment in New York on Thursday

They included activist and writer Mohammed El-Kurd, investigated by the Metropolitan Police after he told protesters in London in January that ‘we must normalise massacres as the status quo’ (El-Kurd later claimed he ‘mis-spoke’).

Academic Cornell West, another Columbia protest speaker, has said that Israel and the US were most to blame for Hamas’s October 7 massacre.

But while they were admitted to the campus one of Columbia’s own Jewish academics was barred from it after he planned a pro-Israel counter-demonstration. He said he was told the university couldn’t guarantee his safety.

‘This is 1938,’ complained Shai Davidai, an assistant professor at the Business School, echoing a common comparison that critics have drawn to that watershed year in Nazi Germany’s persecution of Jews.

John McWhorter, a black professor at Columbia and New York Times columnist, meanwhile highlighted what he saw as the shameless hypocrisy of those who have defended the protests. ‘I thought about what would have happened if protesters were instead chanting anti-black slogans, or even something like “D.E.I. [Diversity, Equity and Inclusion] has got to die,” to the same “Sound Off” tune that “From the river to the sea” has been adapted to,’ he said.

Police intervene at a demonstration at New York University, where students protest in solidarity with those at Columbia University

‘They would have lasted roughly five minutes before masses of students shouted them down and drove them off the campus.’

Why, he asked, ‘do so many people think that weeks-long campus protests against not just the war in Gaza but Israel’s very existence are nevertheless permissible?’.

Meanwhile, at the centre of the storm, a festival atmosphere reigns at Columbia’s reconstructed ‘solidarity encampment’ where some 100 tents have been pitched. Volunteers hand out face masks on entry (so useful to avoid identification) and offer art classes and poetry readings, not to mention organic snacks and bagels. When not chanting slogans and dancing, many protesters spend their days hunched over their studies - though still keeping a watchful eye out for ‘Zionist’ intruders against whom they have been seen linking arms.

A student spokesman for the pro-Palestinian protest said this week that they’ll stay until forcibly removed. ‘When you try to repress us, the movement only grows,’ she warned. In that, at least, she seems to be entirely correct.","Pro-Palestinian protests are spreading like wildfire across US universities, with Jewish students advised to stay home and campus chiefs accused of pandering to the woke Left. Now they might reach the UK…",1

In Los Angeles, Mayor Eric Garcetti has instituted a shutdown on a city of nearly 4 million people and threatened uncooperative business owners with power shutoffs and arrest.

By midday Monday, California had more than 6,300 cases and 132 deaths of reported cases, according to a running list by Johns Hopkins University.

Los Angeles Mayor Garcetti has assigned teams of city workers to ensure non-essential local businesses are complying with shut down orders.

He is empowered to shut off their water and power if necessary, and the California Democrat has authorized the police to arrest those who continue to resist.

Garcetti said there have been no shutoffs or arrests so far and predicts that '99 out of 100 will comply.'

California is enlisting retired doctors and medical and nursing students to help treat an anticipated surge of coronavirus patients, the governor announced Monday.

The community reportedly tried to justify their gathering by saying 'it's a kid's party'

At some moments it looked like a riot was going to break out as the group refused to follow guidelines

The California Health Corps effort comes as the nation's most populous state anticipates hospitals becoming overwhelmed with patients and while it is preparing stadiums and convention centers to handle a crush of cases.

The announcement came as San Francisco and six surrounding counties said they would extend stay-at-home orders until May 1.

Over the weekend, more people appeared to heed the message to stay home after beaches and many parks were closed by state and local officials following a swarm of visitors during the first weekend of the state's stay-at-home order.

Still, people continued to crowd some of the open parks. On Sunday, the state expanded closures amid concerns people were not keeping a proper distance from one another. Parking lots at all state parks were closed, and the most popular places were closed to all activities.

A surfer in Manhattan Beach south of Los Angeles was issued a citation that could carry at $1,000 fine for violating orders to stay off the beach.

To help prepare for a wave of patients, National Guard troops set up beds in the sprawling Los Angeles Convention Center, converting it from a site that normally hosts meetings, trade shows and exhibitions into a field hospital.

Hampshire and Isle of Wight PCC Donna Jones shared a statement last night calling for 'calm' but urged reflection and examination of the wider causes of the disorder, including how the government tackles immigration and building on 'British values'.

'The government must acknowledge what is causing this civil unrest in order to prevent it,' she wrote, saying she would put a 'clear message' to the Prime Minister and Home Secretary about the 'commonality' of grievances between rioters.

'Arresting people, or creating violent disorder units, is treating the symptom and not the cause,' she added.

But as criminal mobs target innocents, religious buildings and police officers in a spate of mindless violence around the country, the statement received significant backlash before it was taken down.

Today, Ms Jones reposted the statement with a clarification, reiterating her calls for 'calm' but adding that she was 'confident there will be a time and place' for 'discussion' on 'a much broader issue' 'in due course'.

The Prime Minister this evening condemned the 'thuggery' of the far-right mob who stormed the hotel in Rotherham, promising those involved in the violence would 'regret it' as the government introduced emergency measures to bring rioters to justice.

Ms Jones, a British Conservative Party politician who has been the Hampshire PCC since 2021, shared an updated statement this afternoon after taking down the original post.

She wrote: 'I want to be clear that the violence that has erupted across the UK this week has been criminal, unlawful and senseless.

'I stand by my statement issued yesterday where I called for calm, and for the country to work together stop this mindless, criminal behaviour.

'I fully support the police's response to stem the growth of these riots and those acting outside of the law should expect to feel the full force of it.

'The violence we have seen has endangered our communities and infected lawful protest on a much broader issue.

'As a country this issue is something we should seek to understand without letting it divide us.

'I am confident there will be a time and place for that discussion in due course.'

The initial post received wide backlash, posted on Saturday after a day of vile rioting across the country.

In the original statement she lamented that police officers were being attacks, and buildings were being targeted because of those living in them or worshipping at them.

With more so-called 'protests' planned across the country - more indeed erupting today, with horrific scenes from Rotherham showing far-right rioters storming into a hotel housing asylum seekers - she called for reflection on their causes.

'The announcement of the Prime Minister's new Violent Crime Units have lead to an accusation of two tier policing, which has enflamed protestors who state they are battling to protect Britain's sovereignty, identity and stop illegal immigration' she wrote.

'Burning towns and cities and attacking the police is not the answer, so how do we stop it?'

'Whilst the devastating attacks in Southport on Monday were a catalyst, the commonality amongst the protest groups appears to be focused on three key areas: the desire to protect Britain's sovereignty; the need to uphold British values and in order to do this, stop illegal immigration,' she added.

'The growth of feeling across the country has mirrored (to a lesser extent) the rebellion to illegal immigration that has played out across France over the last 12 months.

'The government must acknowledge what is causing this civil unrest in order to prevent it. Arresting people, or creating violent disorder units, is treating the symptom and not the cause.

'The questions these people want answering; what is the government's solution to mass uncontrolled immigration? How are the new Labour government going to uphold and build on British values? This is the biggest challenge facing Sir Kier Starmer's government, and its bitten quickly.'

The statement received wide condemnation across the political spectrum online.

Charlie Murphy, who ran as the Liberal Democrats' candidate for Portsmouth South, which experienced clashes on Saturday, wrote on Twitter/X: 'This is particularly astounding from Donna Jones, who once led Portsmouth.

'Our city sacrificed a great deal to defeat fascism, and it should not be represented by someone who leaves the door open to fascists today.'

Danny Chambers, MP for Winchester, wrote: 'I'm deeply concerned to learn Hampshire's Police & Crime Commissioner believes the rioters vandalising our streets and attacking mosques are motivated by 'the need to uphold British values.'

'These extreme views make her totally unsuitable to hold this position of responsibility.'

Liz Jarvis, MP for Eastleigh, wrote: 'Far from appealing for calm, the statement by Hampshire PCC Donna Jones attempting to justify the criminality we have seen across the UK this week is divisive, inflammatory and grossly irresponsible. Her position is clearly untenable.'

Tom Hayes, Labour MP for Bournemouth East, wrote: '

I won't be sharing the inflammatory statement by Donna Jones. This statement is released in Ms Jones' capacity as 'the UK's most senior police and crime commissioner'.

'I have written to Dorset's Commissioner to raise concerns and ask him to distance himself from the statement.'

Labour Councillor Matt Dent wrote: 'A police and crime commissioner releasing a statement like this to justify criminal behaviour should be grounds for immediate resignation.

'Donna Jones' position is clearly untenable.'

Violent riots have swept across several UK cities throughout the week and this weekend, following the deaths of three young girls in Southport.

Axel Rudakubana, a 17-year-old from Lancashire, born in Cardiff, was identified as the suspect in the case, charged with murdering three children at a Taylor Swift-themed dance class on July 29.

But misinformation online about the identity of the suspect before he was named is believed to have prompted far-right groups to amass in cities and towns nationwide.

Claims falsely circulated social media that the suspect was a Muslim asylum seeker.

Sammy Woodhouse, a high-profile victim of the Rotherham child grooming gang scandal, said of the suspect in a broadcast: '[People] feel like they are not being told any information.

'They know the guy's not a British guy. They know he's of a different ethnicity. There's talk of him being a Muslim as well.'

The clip was shared by Tommy Robinson, real name Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, after police had clarified that the claims were false, The Times reports.

Robinson, 41, had a UK arrest warrant issued against him last Monday after he skipped a court appearance.

MailOnline revealed exclusively that he has been staying at a five-star hotel in Cyprus as riots sweep England.

Violence continued through Sunday as police and groups opposing the rioters mobilised to stamp out the spiralling violence.

About 300 people gathered in front of a mosque in Waterloo Road in Middlesbrough to guard it while police blocked off nearby streets.

One resident told the PA news agency: 'We're going to be paying for this, and for what?

'This has got nothing to do with three little girls that have lost their lives. They've used it to cause utter mayhem on our streets.'

A second Shadow Minister wasn’t quite so light-hearted. ‘The Shadow Cabinet all hate him,’ they said bluntly.

Another Shadow Cabinet veteran was similarly direct. ‘The consensus is he’s a plank of wood. If he doesn’t deliver by conference, there’ll be a push to get rid of him.’

Labour MPs are said to be losing patience with Keir Starmer (pictured). One Shadow Minister even joked that 'there's talk of having a whip-round for Durham police' to guarantee they fine him

The Westminster pendulum is again oscillating wildly. A week ago it was Boris facing defenestration at the hands of his party. But now the tables have turned. Despite the Prime Minister’s difficulties, Labour cannot break open a double-digit poll lead.

Focus groups show Keir Starmer failing to cut through. And doubts among his top team resurfaced after a survey for the liberal-leaning Observer found most still prefer Boris for PM.

‘Stop calling me boring,’ Starmer angrily demanded at a meeting of his Shadow Cabinet last Tuesday.

Which would be fine – though a touch petulant – if being tedious really was his main issue. It isn’t. The fundamental difficulty is that over the past few months Starmer has opted to place honesty and probity at the heart of his offer to the electorate.

And no one – not allies, not enemies, not the British people who he’s depending on to deliver him the keys to Downing Street – can rely on a single political word that passes his lips.

Last week at Prime Minister’s Questions, Starmer engaged in a highly transparent and excruciating attempt to demonstrate he’s actually just one of the guys. He made a couple of off-colour quips about Love Island, threw in some comic references to Star Wars, and branded Boris Jabba the Hutt.

A week ago it was Boris Johnson facing defenestration at the hands of his party. But now the tables have turned to Kier Starmer. Doubts among his top team resurfaced after a survey for the liberal-leaning Observer found most still prefer Boris for PM

This from the man who’d said in an interview just a couple of days before: ‘Governing is a serious business. It requires focus, dedication, integrity, and the highest standards. At times like this, people are less interested in the Prime Minister’s jokes and more interested in what he’s doing to help them pay their bills.’

But the most telling moment came when he opted to taunt Boris with a Tory rebels briefing document. ‘It is a document circulated by his backbenchers, in which they call him the “Conservative Corbyn”,’ Starmer gleefully goaded. ‘Prime Minister, I don’t think that was intended as a compliment.’

Nope. But who exactly is this Corbyn fella? The mystery man who St Keir – high priest of integrity and consistency – is suddenly using as a cudgel to batter our hapless PM?

Surely not the same Corbyn Starmer himself served under as Shadow Europe Minister?

The same Corbyn who Starmer spent years trying to get elected Prime Minister?

The same Corbyn whose political programme Starmer embraced during the Labour leadership campaign, forming the foundation of his ‘10 Pledges’?

The same Corbyn Starmer hailed at the start of that campaign as ‘a friend’ he ‘respects’?

DAN HODGES: 'The reality is Keir Starmer was happy to pose as Jeremy Corbyn’s friend. He was happy to serve under him. He was happy to campaign for him, and endorse major parts of his agenda. For as long as it was politically useful. Then when it wasn’t, he junked it'

In the days following the PMQs jibe, the former Labour leader’s allies swung into action. Ex-Unite leader Len McCluskey raged: ‘It seems to me that Keir, who wanted unity to be his most important thing, has failed miserably in that. We have a divided party.’ Leading Corbynite commentator Ash Sarkar tweeted: ‘I would rather boil my own head than vote Labour with this leadership.’

Much of this anger is a rehash of the traditional ‘betrayal’ storyline, so beloved of the Labour Left. But there’s one problem. On this occasion, the accusation of treachery is an accurate one.

The reality is Keir Starmer was happy to pose as Jeremy Corbyn’s friend. He was happy to serve under him. He was happy to campaign for him, and endorse major parts of his agenda. For as long as it was politically useful. Then when it wasn’t, he junked it.

All of which begs the question – just who is Keir Starmer going to betray next?

Some of his cheerleaders claim the answer is obvious: he’ll continue to turn his back on the Left of his party, and embark on a subtle but inexorable drift to the centre.

But it’s not that clear-cut. Not least because most Labour insiders I speak to insist Starmer’s instinctively more Left-wing than people appreciate. Last week I dug out the slick video he made for the launch of his leadership campaign. It featured people who had known him for decades giving an insight into the ‘real’ Keir Starmer.

‘Keir defended the print workers at Wapping,’ one recalled. ‘He was in the crowd that night when police on horseback charged.’ The screen cuts to footage of the Trafalgar Square poll tax riot. ‘He gave free legal advice to the poll tax protesters,’ a friend explains.

But let’s say Starmer is prepared to abandon his old comrades in his pursuit of power. How does that align with his claim ‘I stand for honour and integrity, and the belief that politics is a force for good, and we shouldn’t all be dragged down by this cynical belief that all politicians are the same’?

Allies say this simply shows his politically pragmatism. That he’s abiding by the rule you first pander to your base, then – when secure – the electorate. Yet that represents a misreading of political history.

Thatcher was more radically Right-wing in government than in opposition. Tony Blair pledged to govern as New Labour, and did so. Boris vowed to bulldoze Brexit’s opponents, and on that – if little else – was as good as his word.

'The Corbynites are right. They weren’t able to trust St Keir. And until he comes clean about whose side he’s really on, neither can anyone else.' PICTURED: Jeremy Corbyn

But who can actually trust Keir Starmer? Whose side is he really on? During this week’s rail strikes, is it the unions who can depend on his support, or commuters?

When it comes to the Rwanda deportations, is he on the side of the migrants and their liberal defenders, or those who want firm action to stop the Channel crossings?

Does he stand with women who wish to protect their safe spaces, or the transgender community who wish to access them?

At the moment Keir Starmer can’t answer any of these questions.

Which is supremely ironic – some might say laughably hypocritical – given the nature of the attacks he’s launched on Boris over the past few months.

On last week’s Question Time, former Tory Minister Rory Stewart delivered what many saw as a devastating critique of the Prime Minister. ‘He lurches sometimes to the right, sometimes to the left, but always in the direction of his own self-interest,’ he said.

But exactly the same charge can be levelled at Keir Starmer. If he thinks dumping Corbynism is what’s best for his party, and ultimately the country, fine.

Then he should stand up clearly and say so. He should be open and transparent about how and why Labour lost its way. And he should have the courage and maturity to explain where he intends to lead it next.

Above all, that he should set out his political road-map with honesty and conviction. Not nods and winks and snide asides at Prime Minister’s Questions.

https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jul/14/first-thing-biden-battered-by-inflation-and-low-approval-ratings,1,"Good morning.

Domestic concerns were high on Joe Biden’s agenda as he embarked on his tour of the Middle East on Wednesday, with soaring inflation hitting the president’s approval ratings ahead of this year’s midterm elections.

With inflation at a 40-year peak, Biden labelled the issue the country’s “most pressing economic challenge”. Inflation has largely been driven by energy prices, which will be a priority when he makes a controversial visit to Saudi Arabia this week.

Biden called on energy companies to lower their prices and for Congress to pass a slow-moving economic spending plan that aims to help Americans with the cost of living crisis. The legislation has stalled amid hesitation from moderate Democrats such as Senator Joe Manchin, who has warned against “add[ing] any more fuel to this inflation fire”.

Here’s what you need to know about the midterms:

Economic concerns are paramount for “non-white and working class voters”, a New York Times/Siena College poll found, while white college-educated voters are more focused on issues like abortion and guns.

Only 20% of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents say Biden’s policies have improved the economy.

But it could still be a tighter race than expected, following a series of mass shootings, the supreme court ruling on Roe v Wade, and recent revelations about Donald Trump’s attempts to hold on to power.

Global recession risk rising as economic outlook ‘darkens significantly’, IMF says

The world faces a rising risk of recession in the next year, the head of the IMF has warned, with the war in Ukraine intensifying the cost of living crisis globally.

The outlook for the global economy has “darkened significantly” in recent months, Kristalina Georgieva said on Wednesday, and rising prices caused by the war were “only getting worse”. Additionally, the world’s recovery from the pandemic has been worsened by supply bottlenecks and repeated Covid lockdowns in China.

“The outlook remains extremely uncertain. Think of how further disruption in the natural gas supply to Europe could plunge many economies into recession and trigger a global energy crisis,” Georgieva wrote in a blogpost. “This is just one of the factors that could worsen an already difficult situation.”

What did Georgieva recommend? She called for raised interest rates, reduced government debt and more global cooperation.

Committee argues Capitol attack was premeditated

Donald Trump appears to be facing intensifying legal pressure as the House January 6 committee argues that his instigation of the US Capitol riot was premeditated, making a criminal prosecution increasingly likely.

The panel’s seventh hearing on Tuesday argued that the the former president cannot hide behind a defence of being “willfully blind”. The prospect of witness tampering has also been raised after it was revealed that Trump tried to contact a person talking to the committee about potential testimony.

While Trump and allies have long claimed that the riot was a peaceful demonstration that got out of control, the latest hearing revealed proof that he planned ahead to send protesters, who he knew were armed, to the Capitol.

How likely is a criminal case? It would be “increasingly problematic for the attorney general not to authorise a full-blown investigation”, said the Harvard constitutional law professor Laurence Tribe.

Independent news site Crikey dared the Murdoch family to sue them over story

Lachlan Murdoch has launched defamation proceedings against Crikey after the independent news site dared the powerful media family to sue it in an open letter the editors published as an ad in major US and Australian newspapers.

The Federal Court on Tuesday listed an application brought by Mr Murdoch against Private Media, its managing editor Peter Fray and political correspondent Bernard Keane.

A spokesperson for Mr Murdoch confirmed the defamation proceedings but refused to make further comment.

The opinion piece, posted on June 29 and headlined 'Trump is a confirmed unhinged traitor. And Murdoch is his unindicted co-conspirator', sparked a furious reaction from the billionaires who demanded it be removed.

The article twice mentioned the Murdoch family name.

On Tuesday, Lachlan Murdoch started legal action against the company that owns Crikey in Federal Court after Keane's story suggested they were 'unindicted co-conspirators' in the January 6 insurrection on Washington's Capitol by Donald Trump fanatics.

'We invited Lachlan Murdoch to sue us and now he has,' Mr Fray said in a statement on Tuesday night. 'And we say bring it on.

'We stand by our story because we believe we are dealing with a matter of press freedom and public interest.'

""We await your writ so that we can test this important issue of freedom of public interest journalism in a courtroom.""

Private Media CEO Will Hayward in a statement after the court's confirmation of the writ, also said Crikey stands by its story.

'We look forward to defending our independent public interest journalism in court.

'We are determined to fight for the integrity and importance of diverse independent media in Australian democracy.'

Crikey also published the letters exchanged between its lawyers and those representing Rupert son's Lachlan, threatening to sue the website for defamation.

The article and related social media posts were taken down at first as a 'goodwill' gesture by Crikey but both have since been republished as the publisher stands firm on not apologising

'You responded through your lawyers with a series of letters in which you accused us of defaming you personally in that story,' Private Media chairman Eric Beecher said in a letter to Mr Murdoch posted on social media.

'We want to defend those allegations in court.'

The matter is yet to be assigned a court hearing date.

Crikey publisher Eric Beecher wrote an open letter daring the Murdochs to take legal action against his website

In the open letter, which it ran as an ad in the New York Times and the Sydney Morning Herald, Mr Fray and the chairman of their publisher, Private Media, Eric Beecher say they were defending freedom of the press.

'We at Crikey strongly support freedom of opinion and public interest journalism,' they wrote.

'We are concerned that Australia's defamation laws are too restrictive.'

Mr Fray said he thought it was 'absurd' Australian media couldn't cover the events of January 6 in the same way their US counterparts could, and took issue with the reporting Murdoch-owned outlets published around the siege.

The pair challenged Murdoch's Sydney-based lawyer John Churchill to follow through with his threat of legal action.

'We want to defend those allegations in court,' the pair wrote.

'You have made it clear in your lawyer's letters you intend to take court action to resolve this alleged defamation.

'We await your writ so that we can test this important issue of freedom of public interest journalism in a courtroom.'

Justifying the decision to reprint all the correspondence between their lawyer at MinterEllison and Lachlan Murdoch's representative, Mr Fray claimed Crikey was performing a public service and taking up a cause the Murdochs had championed.

'Like the Murdochs, we believe in the public's right to know,' Mr Fray wrote in an article on Crikey's website.

'Exposing this legal assault is the only way we believe we can shine light on the actions of a powerful media owner (and therefore a competitor of ours) to silence a small publisher by resorting to Australia's defamation laws — laws that News Corp itself constantly argues should give the media more freedom to fulfil its mandated role.'

Trump 'shaman' Jacob Chansley was part of the mob that invaded Congress in Washington to demand the US election result be overturned on January 6 last year

The alleged defamation was in an article written by Mr Keane, called an 'analysis' piece by Crikey, about the Washington DC Capital Hill riot in January 2021, where he argued Fox News commentators played a major role in encouraging the Capitol Hill rioters in 2021.

Fox News is a American arm of the Murdoch family's News Corp media conglomerate.

The article mentions the Murdoch name twice, although it does not specify which family member it refers to, in the headline and in the final sentence.

On June 30, Mr Churchill wrote to Crikey demanding that it immediately take down the article and accompanying social media post as it imputed 'defamatory' accusations about Lachlan 'conspiring' in the pro-Trump insurrection.

Mr Churchill called the article an 'unwarranted attack on my client, without any notice and in complete disregard of the facts'.

The letter also demanded Crikey publish an apology, which was provided by the lawyer, to potentially avoid legal action, but that option was not ruled out even if the steps were promptly taken.

In response, Crikey denied the article made defamatory imputations towards Lachlan Murdoch, arguing the Murdoch referred to was obviously family patriarch Rupert, but as a 'goodwill gesture' it took down the article and the social media posts.

Crikey also invited Lachlan to have an on-the-record interview with the site as a further 'goodwill gesture'.

Crikey later republished the article.

Lachlan Murdoch rejected the offer of an interview and his lawyer wrote back rejecting Crikey's claims the letter did not contain personal accusations and that other media had said similar things.

Some of the grievances Lachlan Murdoch's lawyer made against an article published by Crikey

'It is only in your clients' publications that such scandalous allegations of criminal conduct and conspiracy have been alleged, directly imputing personal and deliberate participation in a plan to cause violence,' Mr Churchill wrote.

There have been further exchanges of letters with both sides sticking to their positions regarding an apology.

In the most recent letter sent to Crikey on August 9, Mr Churchill rejected Crikey's claims that what it published was 'responsible and reasonable public interest journalism'.

'Making allegations about my client in the article was a mistake that should be corrected, and any fair-minded publisher would have promptly offered a genuine apology,' he wrote.

'Your quotes and exaltations about curtailing freedom of speech do not apply — because, as occurs from time to time to most publishers, the journalism in this case is indefensible.'

Demands made by Lachlan Murdoch's lawyer of the independent news blog Crikey in relation to an article by Bernard Keane

In its August 9 reply, Crikey again rejected the demand for an apology.

'You are asking that our client apologise for the most extreme possible interpretation of our article, but not explain what that interpretation is,' MinterEllison partner Michael Bradley writes.

'Readers would think our client is apologising for the article itself. It won't. It stands by its reporting.'",Lachlan Murdoch launches defamation proceedings against Crikey for US Capitol riots story,1

Possibly, it was somewhere in the European Union – to signal the 'reset' in relations that is apparently under way.

Perhaps there is a gite in the Dordogne still awaiting the Starmer arrival, the welcome bottle of rosé pathetically unopened in the fridge door; or there could be some golf balls in the Algarve, still hoping for the honour of being thwacked into the rough by the Starmer clubs.

Maybe there is a brace of empty sun-loungers on a Greek beach, still yearning for Sir Keir and his wife to sink them deeper into the sand as they lie back and toast each other with their pina coladas and 'Keir' royales.

Across the resorts of the world, the bartenders and hotel staff are all asking themselves – will it be us? Will we be the lucky ones? Will the human bollard come and park himself here?

Far-Right protesters hold a demo in Sunderland last weekend, monitored by riot police

I have, as I say, no idea which part of the world Sir Keir will favour with his custom. But I have strong views about when that holiday should take place – and the answer is now. This minute.

Come on, Starmer, man or mouse? Never mind the blasted 'optics' of the situation. Fight down this cowardly anxiety about your personal ratings, and whether the public will mark you down for going on holiday.

Think of your family! Stop worrying that Britain is supposed to be in a state of 'tinderbox' combustibility. It's time to pack the Autan and the Factor 50 – and whoosh, cabin crew doors to manual, and check out of Britain.

Now is the moment to go on holiday, Prime Minister, because it has become ever clearer, over the past week, that your presence has made no difference whatever to the disturbances – or, if anything, made things marginally worse.

The police have got the thing under control, as they always do. The thugs and miscreants are now being processed through the courts with ruthless efficiency.

Rather than holding any more meetings and giving any more of your stunned-mullet press conferences, it is time for you to recharge the batteries. You need to scrunch the sand between your toes, squint at the sea and think.

You need to reflect on the events of the past month, and the whole strategy of the Labour Government, because it is starting to look like a frenzy of utter stupidity.

You might want to start with the bonkers plan to cancel the prison-building programme, and simultaneously release thousands of serious criminals before they have completed their sentences.

Where are you going to put all these rioters, once they have been convicted? Butlin's?

And what happens when the thousands of prematurely liberated prisoners decide – as, sadly, so many of them do – to re-offend? Where do they go?

You are going to need more prison places, not fewer – or else people will start to conclude that your critics were right all along, and that the Government is now in the hands of Lefty human rights lawyers who are basically soft on crime.

And then you need some space to think about the meaning of these riots, and their causes.

You say it is all a form of 'far-Right thuggery', and I agree that anyone offering violence and intimidation needs to be banged up. The riots have been disgraceful. They are a criminal justice problem that demands a criminal justice solution, and they are getting one. But is that the whole story?

I saw an astonishing statistic that 34 per cent of the public actually support the protests – if not the violence associated with it.

Does that mean that more than a third of the UK population are 'far-Right' in their views?

I know that there are some people who claim it is 'far-Right' to believe in Brexit, or to support the existence of the state of Israel, or to share the views of J.K. Rowling about who exactly a woman is these days.

There may even be some Left-wingers who believe that 34 per cent of the population is 'far-Right' in that they actually hold racist or bigoted views.

I don't believe that for a second. I believe that Britain is, on the whole, a remarkably loving, welcoming and generous society. So how the hell can a third of Britons apparently support these protests? What has gone wrong?

It is time to reflect, PM, as you sip your sundowner, on whether you struck exactly the right note on illegal immigration, and I mean illegal immigration, the kind that is resented especially by many who have brought their families here perfectly legally.

You kicked off your premiership by announcing with glee that you were cancelling the Rwanda plan – even though it is the only idea that has any chance of working, and stopping the cruel cross-Channel gangs, and which is now being imitated by plenty of other governments.

You announced that about 100,000 asylum seekers were going to be given an amnesty, instead of being deported.

You closed the Bibby Stockholm ship where some of the illegal arrivals were being held.

Whatever you may have intended by all this, you gave the clear impression of a man who has no plan to stop illegal immigration, because he simply doesn't care.

Indeed, Yvette Cooper, the new Home Secretary, offered the extraordinary suggestion that we should stop talking about 'illegal' immigration, and only about 'irregular' immigration. That is an insult to those, as I say, who have come here legally.

Nothing excuses the behaviour of the rioters, and they deserve to be banged up. But nothing excuses a Government that seems deaf to public concerns, and that suggests, moreover, that they actively dislike all members of the public who share those concerns.

All this bears mulling over, Sir Keir; and while you are at it you might re-think your whole economic approach.

You have bunged a huge increase in public-sector pay, with no increase in productivity, as a sop to your union paymasters, while cancelling the previous Conservative plan: which was to begin to trim the vast expansion in the size of Whitehall bureaucracy by 66,000 jobs.

We all know that 80 per cent of public-sector spending is on the salaries of public-sector workers, and yet Labour, again, has no plan whatever for reform – but axes building new hospitals instead.

You are about to pay for all this pay inflation with blatantly unnecessary growth-choking taxes, on pensions and investments and much else. It is madness.

It is the last thing we need now, after all the misery and expense of Covid. In a pathetic attempt to justify your tax hikes, you have lied about the state of the economy – and been caught out.

You have already put back the cause of free speech at universities, by revoking the Act that had just been passed to protect it.

You have appointed cronies – people who have personally given money to you or to your Chancellor, Rachel Reeves – to government posts.

Stop all this nonsense, and go on holiday, Prime Minister. Stand not upon the order of your going, but go at once.

Have some guts, face down your critics, and acquire the perspective that comes with distance and a kilo of retsina.

Go now, and don't come back till you have bucked up your ideas.","BORIS JOHNSON: Time to pack the Factor 50, Keir, check out of Britain - and reflect on the frenzy of utter stupidity Labour's embarked on",1

Emergency services descended on Dudley Street, which runs from Randwick to Coogee, shortly after 11am on Tuesday following a 'concern for welfare' call.

A police spokesperson described it is an 'ongoing situation' and warned the public to avoid the area.

At least a dozen armed riot police, including one officer holding a chainsaw, surrounded a unit block on the street.

The block is reportedly not far from a Catholic high school.

The situation is understood to be mental health-related and residents were advised to stay indoors.

'Dudley Street Randwick has been blocked by police and there are multiple police vehicles,' one X user posted.

Another person posted on social media that 'something major is going on in our Dudley Street, Randwick'.

'No cars or pedestrians but riot police and undercover cop cars have driven up Dudley Street - which is closed from St Paul's Street to Coogee Bay Road,' they added.

A spokesperson for NSW Police said the operation was prompted by a 'concern for welfare'.

'Police are speaking with a man inside a unit,' the spokesperson added.

'Specialist police are on scene. The public are urged to avoid the area.'

The tech giant slapped down Haugen after she testified to Congress on Tuesday, saying that the data scientist never attended meetings with top executives and that she was wildly misinformed about the company.

Mark Zuckerberg wrote in an open letter to his staff: 'I think most of us just don't recognize the false picture of the company that is being painted.'

Haugen told Capitol Hill how Facebook put its 'astronomical profits' above the safeguarding of its users and that Zuckerberg had been directly involved in decisions that increased 'misinformation, hate speech and other inciting content.'

She said that executives were aware that Facebook and Instagram, which it owns, were harmful for children, with a leaked internal study revealing that teenage girls had increased suicidal thoughts from using Instagram.

The 37-year-old said that Facebook's algorithms, centered around 'likes' and 'shares', rewarded 'dangerous online talk has led to actual violence that harms and even kills people.'

Her claims were devastating for Facebook's public image and prompted senators from across the aisle to attack the firm and Zuckerberg, who has previously been summoned to the Capitol to testify on his firm's practices.

Facebook's director of policy communications, Lena Pietsch, responded to Haugen's testimony by pointing out she worked at the company for less than two years.

Pietsch added that Haugen 'had no direct reports, never attended a decision-point meeting with C-level executives - and testified more than six times to not working on the subject matter in question.'

But Facebook agreed on the need for more regulation.

'It's time to begin to create standard rules for the internet,' Pietsch said.

'It's been 25 years since the rules for the internet have been updated, and instead of expecting the industry to make societal decisions that belong to legislators, it is time for Congress to act.'

In Haugen's blistering testimony she said:

Mark Zuckerberg is only 'accountable to himself' and has been directly involved in decisions that put profit over 'decreasing misinformation, hate speech and other inciting content'

Executives are aware that Facebook is harmful for children, with it 'exposing teenagers to anorexia content' and 'pulling families apart'

A leaked internal Facebook study showed 13.5% of British teenagers said their suicidal thoughts were more frequent because of Instagram (which FB owns)

Another leaked study found 17% of teen girls said their eating disorders got worse after using Instagram

The site profits from 'dangerous online talk has led to actual violence that harms and even kills people'

Facebook covered up the extent to which it knew about the planners of the Capitol siege

The firm 'hides vital information from the public, from the U.S. government, and from governments around the world'

Mark Zuckerberg on Tuesday evening defended his company, saying it was 'frustrating' to see a 'false picture' of Facebook being painted by Haugen

Frances Haugen on Tuesday appeared before Congress to discuss the workings of Facebook. She suggested a government entity be created to regulate Facebook during the scathing Senate hearing

Zuckerberg said Haugen painted 'a false picture of the company'.

In a memo he sent to all staff, which he posted on Facebook, he wrote: 'I'm sure many of you have found the recent coverage hard to read because it just doesn't reflect the company we know.

'We care deeply about issues like safety, well-being and mental health. It's difficult to see coverage that misrepresents our work and our motives.

'At the most basic level, I think most of us just don't recognize the false picture of the company that is being painted.'

Zuckerberg said it was 'just not true' that the company prioritizes profit over all other concerns, and said it was not in their interests to promote damaging content.

He said the company was doing a lot of work on moderation, and on protecting children.

But Zuckerberg's response was torn apart by lawmakers who agreed that Haugen's claims were backed up by evidence.

Democratic Senator Richard Blumenthal kicked off the hearing by calling Facebook 'morally bankrupt' and criticized Zuckerberg for going sailing in Hawaii with wife Priscilla Chan instead of answering questions from lawmakers.

Senator Ed Markey also piled on the absent tech billionaire, addressing him by name during the hearing to warn him that 'Congress will be taking action' with or without his help.

'Your time of invading privacy, promoting toxic content, and preying on children and teens is over. Congress will be taking action. You can work with us, or not work with us, but we will not allow your company to harm our children and our families and out democracy any longer,' Markey said.

Haugen told senators that no similar company's CEO has as much unilateral control as Zuckerberg does.

'Mark holds a very unique role in the tech industry in that he holds over 55% of all the voting shares for Facebook. There are no similarly powerful companies that are as unilaterally controlled,' she said. 'There's no one currently holding him accountable but himself.'

She said 'the buck stops with' Facebook's tech billionaire owner, adding that 'Facebook needs to take responsibility for the consequences of its choices.'

Later in the hearing Haugen said Zuckerberg himself even made choices that put engagement over public safety.

'We have a few choice documents that contain notes from briefings with Mark Zuckerberg where he chose metrics defined by Facebook like ""meaningful social interactions"" over changes that would have significantly decreased misinformation, hate speech and other inciting content,' she told Senator Ben Ray Lujan.

Markey lauded Haugen as a 'Twenty-first century American hero' for speaking out against the social media giant.

He also accused Facebook of being built on 'computer codes of misconduct.'

'Time and time again Facebook says one thing and does another. Time and time again Facebook fails to abide by the commitments that they had made. Time and time again, Facebook lies about what they are doing,' he said.

'Facebook's platforms are not safe for young people, as you said Facebook is like big tobacco, enticing young kids with that first cigarette...whistleblowing shows that Facebook uses harmful features.'

During his second round of hearing Markey accused Facebook of using lobbyists to block legislators' reform efforts.

Blumenthal criticized Facebook's founder earlier on in his opening statement on Tuesday morning.

Haugen suggested Facebook's self-created burden could have gotten so large that they simply didn't know what to do with it and felt 'trapped'

'Mark Zuckerberg ought to be looking at himself in the mirror today,' the Connecticut Democrat said. 'And yet rather than taking responsibility and showing leadership, Mr. Zuckerberg is going sailing.'

'Mark Zuckerberg you need to come before this committee, you need to explain to Frances Hougan, to us, to the world, and to the parents of America - what you were doing and why you did it.'

Whistleblower Francis Haugen says Facebook has put its 'astronomical profits before people'

Haugen began her testimony with a scathing opening statement accusing Facebook leadership of knowingly allow its products to 'harm children, stoke division and weaken our democracy.'

She celebrated a massive outage that affected Facebook and its related sites.

'Yesterday we saw Facebook get taken off the internet. I don't know why it went down, but I do know for more than five hours, Facebook wasn't used to deepen divides, destabilize democracies and make young girls and women feel bad about their bodies,' Haugen said.

She also said Facebook had done too little to prevent its platform from being used by people planning violence, claiming executives chose profit over safety whenever possible.

'The company's leadership knows ways to make Facebook and Instagram safer but won't make the necessary changes because they have put their astronomical profits before people,' she claimed.

The result of which, she said, 'has been more division, more harm, more lies, more threats and more combat. In some cases, this dangerous online talk has led to actual violence that harms and even kills people.'

Haugen acknowledged that problems with social media were incredibly complex - citing her experience working at four different social media platforms.

'However, the choices being made inside Facebook are disastrous - for children, for public safety, for our privacy and for our democracy - that is why I came forward. And let's be clear: it doesn't have to be this way. We are here today because of deliberate choices Facebook has made,' she said.

Haugen calls for government to step in and regulate Facebook

The whistleblower acknowledged that the site's mounting problems could be too large for it to handle on its own.

'You can declare moral bankruptcy and we can figure out how to fix these things together, because we solve problems together and we don't solve them alone,' she said.

She suggested Facebook's self-created burden could have gotten so large that they simply didn't know what to do with it.

'Facebook is stuck in a feedback loop they cannot get out of. They have been hiding this information because they feel trapped. Like, they would have come forward if they had solutions to these things. They need to admit they did something wrong, and that they need help to solve these problems.'

But she also doubted that Facebook's lack of solutions came from a lack of 'private research' as an executive once said.

'If they make $40 billion per year, they have the resources to solve these problems, they're choosing not to solve them,' she told Senator Rick Scott.

Haugen told Republican Senator Mike Lee that Facebook's artificial intelligence systems designed to filter out harmful content were relatively ineffective at catching hate speech - and even sometimes allowed drug-related content to get to kids.

'The reality is that we've seen from repeated documents within my disclosures, is that Facebook's AI systems only catch a very tiny minority of offending content. And best case scenario, and the case of something like hate speech, at most they will ever get 10 to 20 percent. In the case of children, that means drug paraphernalia ads like that, it's likely if they rely on computers and not humans, they will also likely never get more than 10 to 20 percent of those ads,' she said.

She suggested a social media-specific regulatory body within the government as a possible solution at several points in the hearing.

Haugen claimed oversight could 'make Facebook a more profitable company five or 10 years from now' and would be 'kinder, friendlier and more collaborative.'

She said such an agency is 'in everyone's interest.'

Until such regulation, the whistleblower warned, Facebook won't move to change on its own.

'Until incentives change at Facebook, we should not expect Facebook to change. We need action from Congress,' she said.

And such action may be coming - Markey promised during his allotted time that 'Congress will take action.'

Facebook responds to Haugen's claims during the hearing

A Facebook executive went after Haugen during the hearing, pointing out that she did not work with the data she was testifying on at the hearing.

'Just pointing out the fact that @FrancesHaugen did not work on child safety or Instagram or research these issues and has no direct knowledge of the topic from her work at Facebook,' Policy Communications Director Andy Stone wrote on Twitter Tuesday.

Senator Marsha Blackburn responded to Stone's tweet during the hearing.

'I will simply say this to Mr. Stone: If Facebook wants to discuss their targeting of children, if they want to discuss their practices of privacy invasion or violation of the Children's Online Privacy Act, I am extending to you an invitation to step forward, be sworn in and testify before this committee. We would be pleased to hear from you and welcome your testimony,' Blackburn said.

Haugen has said multiple times during the hearing that she didn't work in child safety but claimed the documents she viewed and leaked were available to all staff.

Stone later released a statement from Facebook's Director of Policy Communications Lena Pietsch. Pietsch dismissed Haugen as an ex-employee 'who worked for the company for less than two years' but agreed with her calls for more internet regulation.

'Today, a Senate Commerce subcommittee held a hearing with a former product manager at Facebook who worked for the company for less than two years, had no direct reports, never attended a decision-point meeting with C-level executives - and testified more than six times to not working on the subject matter in question,' the statement read.

Pietsch did agree with Hauge that Congress needed to act on reforms for any meaningful change to occur.

'We don't agree with her characterization of the many issues she testified about. Despite all this, we agree on one thing; it's time to begin to create standard rules for the internet. It's been 25 years since the rules for the internet have been updated, and instead of expecting the industry to make societal decisions that belong to legislators, it is time for Congress to act,' she said.

Facebook's Global Head of Safety Antigone Davis, who testified before the same panel last week, defended her company in an MSNBC interview during the hearing.

'Of course we want to allow for freedom of expression, but one of the underlying principles behind the work that we do is ensuring people's safety and security. Most people really do feel quite safe and secure on our platform, and they’re coming back and using our platform because they do feel safe and secure, and we are doing a good job to get that content off. But I do think there are validation systems that people want in place,' she said.

Davis, faced a barrage of criticism from senators on the Commerce panel at a hearing last Thursday. They accused Facebook of concealing the negative findings about Instagram and demanded a commitment from the company to make changes.

Davis defended Instagram's efforts to protect young people using its platform. She disputed the way The Wall Street Journal story describes what the research shows.

Facebook maintains that Haugen's allegations are misleading and insists there is no evidence to support the premise that it is the primary cause of social polarization.

'Even with the most sophisticated technology, which I believe we deploy, even with the tens of thousands of people that we employ to try and maintain safety and integrity on our platform, we´re never going to be absolutely on top of this 100% of the time,' Nick Clegg, Facebook´s vice president of policy and public affairs, said Sunday on CNN´s 'Reliable Sources.'

Facebook changed misinformation safeguards put in place ahead of election just before Capitol riot because 'they wanted that growth back'

Among its controversies, Facebook was used by people planning mass killings in Myanmar and in the Jan. 6 assault by Trump supporters who were determined to toss out the 2020 election results.

After the November election, Facebook dissolved the civic integrity union where Haugen had been working. That, she said, was the moment she realized 'I don´t trust that they're willing to actually invest what needs to be invested to keep Facebook from being dangerous.'

Haugen was greeted by Senator Richard Blumenthal and Senator Amy Klobuchar when she arrived for her testimony

Speaking to Senators on Tuesday, Haugen celebrated a massive outage that hit Facebook and its related sites the day before

Senator Amy Klobuchar, who is on the subcommittee, asked Haugen if the site removed safeguards against misinformation it had implemented for the election before the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol.

Haugen said the social media giant knew the content that was being shared was 'dangerous' before they increased site security but dropped those standards for the sake of 'growth.'

'Facebook has been emphasizing a false choice. They've said the safeguards that were in place before the election implicated free speech. The choices that were happening on the platform were really about how reactive and twitchy was the platform.'

'Facebook changed those safety defaults in the run-up to the election because they knew they were dangerous. And because they wanted that growth back...they returned to their original defaults.'

She also said Zuckerberg was 'directly presented with a list of soft interventions' - or options to lessen the volume of potentially harmful content - ahead of the election but decided not to because it would impact the platform's engagement rates.

'Mark Zuckerberg was directly presented with a list of soft interventions and chose to not remove downstream MSI in April of 2020, even in isolated and at-risk countries, if it had any impact on the overall MSI,' she said.

Haugen speculated that he did so because the MSI metric is tied to bonuses - 'If you hurt MSI, a bunch of people wouldn't get their bonuses.'

Blumenthal says Facebook is 'morally bankrupt' and Haugen says it intentionally leads young users to 'anorexia content'

Blumenthal said Facebook was facing a 'big tobacco moment' in the country's reckoning over its impact on a generation of young people, slamming the company as 'morally bankrupt.'

'The damage to self interest and self worth inflicted by Facebook today will haunt a generation,' Blumenthal said. 'Feelings of inadequacy, and insecurity, rejection and self hatred will impact this generation for years to come.

Later during the hearing Haugen told Senator Jerry Moran of Kansas that Facebook and Instagram were knowingly exacerbating problems that kids face.

'They know that severe harm is happening to children,' Haugen said.

She said Facebook targets 'children as young as eight' for its Messenger Kids app, and goes after kids under age 18 for Instagram.

Haugen also addressed the mental effects Facebook's algorithms have on children, particularly young girls, similar to building a tobacco addiction.

'Facebook knows that they are leading young users to anorexia content,' she said. 'It’s just like cigarettes. Teenagers don’t have any self-regulation. We need to protect the kids.'

At another point in the hearing Haugen was asked by Senator Dan Sullivan about what perspective people will have on Facebook years from now.

She answered: 'When Facebook has made statements in the past about how much benefit Instagram is providing to kids' mental health, like kids are connecting who were once alone, what I'm so surprised about that is - if Instagram is such a positive force, have we seen a golden age of teenage mental health in the last 10 years? No, we've seen escalating rates of depression and suicide among teenagers.'

Haugen added that the use of social media 'amplified' the risk of that, attributing it to Facebook's own research.

'I saw Facebook repeatedly encounter conflicts between its own profits and our safety. Facebook consistently resolved its conflicts in favor of its own profits. In some cases, this dangerous online talk has led to actual violence.' 'Mark holds a very unique role in the tech industry in that he holds over 55% of all the voting shares for Facebook. There are no similarly powerful companies that are as unilaterally controlled. ... There's no one currently holding him accountable but himself..' 'Almost no one outside of Facebook knows what happens inside of Facebook. The company intentionally hides vital information from the public, from the U.S. government, and from governments around the world.' 'We can afford nothing less than full transparency. As long as Facebook is operating in the shadows and hiding its research from public scrutiny, it is unaccountable. Until the incentives change, Facebook will not change. ' 'They want you to believe in false choices, they want you to believe you must choose between a Facebook full of divisive and extreme content or losing one of the most important values our country was founded on, free speech.' Democratic Senator Richard Blumenthal 'Their (Facebook's) profit was more important than the pain that it caused. There is documented proof that Facebook knows its products can be addictive and toxic to children, and it is not just that they made money - it’s that they valued their more than the pain they caused to children and their families. 'Facebook's failure to acknowledge and to act makes it morally bankrupt. Again and again, Facebook rejected reforms recommended by its own researchers. 'The damage to self worth, inflicted by Facebook today will haunt a generation. Feelings of inadequacy and insecurity and rejection and self-hatred will impact this generation for years.

Facebook whistleblower speaks out on CBS' 60 Minutes

After recent reports in The Wall Street Journal based on documents she leaked to the newspaper raised a public outcry, Haugen revealed her identity in a CBS '60 Minutes' interview aired Sunday night.

She claims Facebook had a role in the January 6 Capitol riots and is damaging for teenagers, particularly young girls.

The ex-employee challenging the social network giant with 2.8 billion users worldwide and nearly $1 trillion in market value is a 37-year-old data expert from Iowa with a degree in computer engineering and a master's degree in business from Harvard.

Facebook whistleblower Frances Haugen (pictured) will urge Congress today to regulate social media, saying the sites harm children and even lead to violence

Senator Amy Klobuchar, who is on the subcommittee, asked Haugen about the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol

She worked at companies including Google and Pinterest for 15 years prior to being recruited by Facebook in 2019.

'The company's leadership knows ways to make Facebook and Instagram safer and won't make the necessary changes because they have put their astronomical profits before people. Congressional action is needed,' she will say.

'As long as Facebook is operating in the dark, it is accountable to no one. And it will continue to make choices that go against the common good.'

Haugen, who worked as a product manager on Facebook's civic misinformation team, was the whistleblower who provided documents used in a Wall Street Journal investigation and a Senate hearing on Instagram's harm to teen girls.

The panel is examining Facebook's use of information from its own researchers on Instagram that could indicate potential harm for some of its young users, especially girls, while it publicly downplayed the negative impacts.

For some of the teens devoted to Facebook´s popular photo-sharing platform, the peer pressure generated by the visually focused Instagram led to mental health and body-image problems, and in some cases, eating disorders and suicidal thoughts, the research leaked by Haugen showed.

One internal study cited 13.5 percent of teen girls saying Instagram makes thoughts of suicide worse and 17 percent of teen girls saying it makes eating disorders worse.

Facebook owns Instagram as well as WhatsApp.

The company did not respond to a request for comment.

Haugen added that 'Facebook's closed design means it has no oversight even from its own Oversight Board, which is as blind as the public.'

That makes it impossible for regulators to serve as a check, she added.

'This inability to see into the actual systems of Facebook and confirm that Facebook's systems work like they say is like the Department of Transportation regulating cars by watching them drive down the highway,' her testimony says. 'Imagine if no regulator could ride in a car, pump up its wheels, crash test a car, or even know that seat belts could exist.'

The Journal's stories, based on Facebook internal presentations and emails, showed the company contributed to increased polarization online when it made changes to its content algorithm; failed to take steps to reduce vaccine hesitancy; and was aware that Instagram harmed the mental health of teenage girls.

Haugen says she told Facebook executives when they recruited her that she had asked to work in an area of the company that fights misinformation, because she had lost a friend to online conspiracy theories.

That's because of the 'instantaneous and spontaneous form of communication' on Facebook, Clegg said, adding, 'I think we do more than any reasonable person can expect to.'

By coming forward, Haugen says she hopes it will help spur the government to put regulations in place for Facebook´s activities. Like fellow tech giants Google, Amazon and Apple, Facebook has for years enjoyed minimal regulation in Washington.

Separately Monday, a massive global outage plunged Facebook, Instagram and the company's WhatsApp messaging platform into chaos, only gradually dissipating by late Monday Eastern time. For some users, WhatsApp was working for a time, then not. For others, Instagram was working but not Facebook, and so on.

Facebook didn't say what might have caused the outage, which began around 11:40 a.m. EDT and was still not fixed more than six hours later.",Facebook calls for internet to be regulated in statement criticizing Haungen as a low-level employee,1
https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/sep/08/trump-rally-north-carolina-mask,1,"A packed crowd of hundreds gathered in North Carolina for a Donald Trump campaign rally on Tuesday, with many people forgoing masks, in defiance of state guidelines capping gatherings at 50 people.

Ahead of the president’s visit to Winston-Salem, the chair of the local county commission, a Republican, urged Trump to wear a face mask. The state has a mask requirement in place to slow the spread of coronavirus.

“It’s been ordered by the governor,” said Dave Plyler, the Republican chairman of the Forsyth county board of commissioners, according to the Winston-Salem Journal. “When in Rome, do as the Romans do. When in North Carolina, do as the governor says.”

Trump “is a citizen of the United States, but he is also a guest in our county”, Plyler said. “Without a mask, he could get sick, and he could blame the governor.”

However, Trump did not wear a mask, and used the event to mock his Democratic opponent, Joe Biden, for following social distancing guidelines. “You ever see the gyms with the circles?” he said, an apparent reference to a Biden event held in a school gymnasium with attendees observing social distancing guidelines.

Nearly 178,000 people in North Carolina have tested positive Covid-19, with more than 1,000 cases reported on Tuesday – though the number of cases and deaths are slowly trending downward.

Recent polls have found Trump locked in a close race with Biden in North Carolina. As the coronavirus pandemic rages on, the president has often sought to focus on the economy and policing rather than the virus.

While supporters waited for Trump to arrive, Knockin’ on Heaven’s Door played over the loudspeakers, making for an inadvertently dark soundtrack.

Deriding the mass demonstrations across the country against racism and policing, Trump told the jam-packed, cheering crowd: “We decided to call our rallies peaceful protests.”

The president has previously used the phrase to describe gatherings of his supporters, saying that if protesters against police brutality are allowed to gather then his supporters should be able to as well.

“Because they have rules in these Democrat-run states that if you campaign you cannot have more than five people,” the president said. “You can’t go to church, you can’t do anything outside. If you are willing to riot, running down the main street, if you want to riot and stand on top of each other’s face and do whatever the hell you want to do, you are allowed to do that because you are considered a peaceful protester.”

His claims, however, are an exaggeration. In North Carolina, governed by Democrat Roy Cooper, gatherings are currently capped at 50, and masks are mandated. Going outside is allowed in North Carolina (as it is in all states), and churches are allowed to conduct services, though officials recommend that worshippers follow social distancing and wear masks.

There have been more than 6.3m cases of coronavirus in the US, with the country approaching 190,000 deaths. Trump’s rally comes as health experts warn the hunt for a vaccine has become increasingly politicized, with the Trump administration rushing to release one ahead of the November election.

Dr Anthony Fauci, the leading White House infectious disease expert, who has been increasingly at odds with Trump, stressed on Tuesday that a coronavirus vaccine would be unlikely to be ready “by the end of the year”. Fauci contradicted the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), which has signaled that health officials might expect a vaccine to be ready before the election.

“It’s unlikely we’ll have a definitive answer” on whether a vaccine is safe and effective by the election, Fauci said at the Research! America 2020 National Health Research Forum.",Crowds eschew masks at Trump rally as president mocks Biden over social distancing,1
https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-9701813/Mike-Pence-called-TRAITOR-faith-conference.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490,1,"Former Vice President Mike Pence was booed and called a 'traitor' at a Faith & Freedom Coalition event in Orlando Friday.

'It is great to be back with so many patriots. Dedicated to faith and freedom and the road to the majority,' Pence said at the 'Road to Majority'-themed event.

As he began thanking Ralph Reed, the head of the Faith & Freedom coalition, he was met with boos and people loudly shouting 'traitor!'

The Road to Majority conference attracted a number of conservative household names including Sens. Ted Cruz, Marco Rubio, Ron Johnson, Rick Scott, Marsha Blackburn, Lindsey Graham and House Minority Whip Steve Scalise.

And they pushed a number of right-wing talking points with Cruz, for example, remarking that 'critical race theory is bigoted. It is a lie, And it is every bit as racist as the Klansmen in white sheets.'

Cruz also said: 'I'm going to commit a radical act, I'm going to speak the truth. America is great. Christopher Columbus discovering America was a good thing. George Washington was an American hero. Thomas Jefferson was an American hero. Abraham Lincoln was an American hero.

He also lambasted the days when you could say 'Israel is our friend, boys and girls are different and the Wuhan virus came from Wuhan' without the 'fear of getting cancelled'

Pence barely introduced himself before the audience rebeled.

'And I want to thank my friend Ralph Reed for those overly generous words, I'm deeply humbled by them,' Pence said.

'Ralph Reed knows me well enough to know the introduction I prefer is a little bit shorter: I'm a Christian, a conservative and a Republican, and I'm honored to stand before you today,' he continued, as the shouts also continued.

In the lead-up to the January 6 MAGA riot, former President Donald Trump pushed Pence, who had a Constitutional duty to preside over Congress' counting of Electoral College votes, to throw out votes from key swing states - in an effort to overturn President Joe Biden's win.

'I hope Mike is going to do the right thing. I hope so. I hope so,' Trump told the crowd at the Ellipse on the morning of January 6, before droves of them stormed the Capitol. 'Because if Mike Pence does the right thing, we win the election.'

Trump falsely claimed to the crowd that Pence had 'the absolute right' to toss out Electoral Votes at his choosing.

Pence publicly said he didn't see it that way.

When rioters got to the Capitol later on January 6, some chanted 'hang Mike Pence' for his refusal to do Trump's bidding.

During Trump's second impeachment hearing, video footage showed Pence narrowly escaping from the crowd.

Trump never called to check in on him.

Earlier this month, Pence tried to push that he was still on Trump's good side telling an audience at the Lincoln-Reagan Dinner in Manchester, New Hampshire that he'd spoken to Trump 'many times' since they left office.

He admitted, however, that they do not 'see eye-to-eye' on the January 6 insurrection.

'But I will always be proud of what we accomplished for the American people over the last four years,' Pence said. 'And I will not allow Democrats or their allies in the media to use one tragic day to discredit the aspirations of millions of Americans,' he added.

He told the audience that he 'learned a lot serving alongside President Donald Trump.'

'Some people think we're a little bit different,' the ex-veep said. 'But I think what President Trump showed us was what Republicans can accomplish when our leaders stand firm on conservative principles and don't back down.'

'It was four years of consequence, four years of results,' Pence said. 'It was four years of promises made and promises kept.'",Mike Pence is called a 'TRAITOR' at faith conference,1
https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-9137169/Trump-blamed-ANTIFA-people-Capitol-riot-shot-House-GOP-leader-Kevin-McCarthy.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ito=1490&ns_campaign=1490,1,"Donald Trump falsely believes that 'ANTIFA people' were behind Wednesday's riot, he told the most senior Republican in the House, but does accept some blame for the unrest that killed five people.

Kevin McCarthy, the fiercely loyal House Minority Leader, told House Republicans on Monday that Trump bears some blame for last week's deadly Capitol riots and has accepted some responsibility, Politico reported, citing four Republican sources on a private call.

Trump has not publicly acknowledged any responsibility for the attack, which unfolded after he staged a rally on Wednesday and called on his supporters to 'fight' the election result and 'persuade' Republicans not to certify Joe Biden's victory.

However, Trump last night declared a state of emergency in D.C. amid ratcheting tensions over violent plots which could rock Capitol Hill ahead of Biden's inauguration.

The declaration allows the Department of Homeland Security and Federal Emergency Management Agency to coordinate with local authorities as Democrats had been demanding.

Last week's chaos resulted in the deaths of four rioters and one Capitol Police officer; dozens of injuries; and extensive damage throughout the ransacked building.

McCarthy strongly pushed back against Trump's claim that the rioters were Left-wing agitators intent on discrediting Trump and his followers - a claim made by staunchly pro-Trump congressman Matt Gaetz, and repeated by Fox News' anchors and pundits.

'It's not ANTIFA, it's MAGA,' McCarthy replied, according to Axios.

'I know. I was there,' McCarthy said, according to a White House official and another source familiar with the call.

McCarthy later reiterated his position during a two-hour meeting with Republicans in the House, telling them there is 'undisputedly' no evidence that people linked to ANTIFA participated in the insurrection.

The theory that anti-Trump agitators stirred up the unrest has been decisively debunked. Those arrested so far for their part in the riots have in many cases a long and public history of supporting the president: none of those detained has been a supporter of ANTIFA.

Trump, during the tense 30 minute conversation with McCarthy on Monday morning, also continued to insist that the election had been stolen from him.

McCarthy, exasperated, told him: 'Stop it. It's over. The election is over.'

WHAT DOES THE 25TH AMENDMENT SAY? CAN TRUMP'S CABINET REALLY TOPPLE HIM? The 25th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution deals with presidential authority in the event of death or removal from office, and was ratified in 1967, in the wake of John F Kennedy's assassination. What does the 25th Amendment say? It is in four sections, all dealing with the president leaving office during his or her elected term. The first section states that the vice president takes over the Oval Office if the president dies or resigns – or is removed – something which the original Constitution did not clearly state. Presidents of course can be removed by impeachment, a feature of the constitution from the start. They can also be removed through the 25th Amendment - of which more below. Section II states that if the vice president dies, or resigns – or is fired – both the House and Senate have to confirm a new vice president. Until 1967, presidents could change vice presidents mid-term on their own if they got the vice president to agree to resign - not something that actually happened, but which was possible in principle. Section III makes clear that a president can temporarily delegate his powers to the vice president, and later reclaim them when he - or she - is capable of serving. This is most often invoked if a president is under the influence of surgical anesthetic for a short period of time. Section IV is the amendment's most controversial part: it describes how the president can be removed from office if he is incapacitated and does not leave on his own. The vice president and 'a majority of either the principal officers of the executive departments or of such other body as Congress may by law provide' must write to both the president pro tempore of the Senate and the Speaker of the House, saying that 'the President is unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office.' The term principal officers of the executive departments would normally mean the cabinet secretaries. So at least eight of the president's 15 most senior Cabinet members together with the vice president must agree that a president should be removed before any plan can move forward. Notifying the House Speaker and the Senate president pro tempore is the act that immediately elevates the vice president to an 'acting president' role. The deposed president can contest the claim, giving the leaders of the bloodless coup four days to re-assert their claims to the House and Senate. Congress then has two days to convene – unless it is already in session – and another 21 days to vote on whether the president is incapable of serving. A two-thirds majority in both houses is required to make that determination. As soon as there is a vote with a two-thirds majority, the president loses his powers and is removed, and the vice president stops acting and is sworn in as president. But if 21 days of debate and votes ends without a two-thirds majority, the president gets back his powers. What could happen to trigger the 25th Amendment? Vice President Mike Pence and eight of the 15 'principal' Cabinet members would have to agree to notify Congress that President Donald Trump was incapable of running the country. That group is made up of the Secretary of State, Treasury Secretary, Secretary of Defense, Attorney General, Interior Secretary, Agriculture Secretary, Commerce Secretary, Labor Secretary, Health and Human Services Secretary, Transportation Secretary, Energy Secretary , Education Secretary, Veterans Affairs Secretary and Homeland Security Secretary. Their formal notification would go to the House Speaker and, in the senate, to the 'president pro tempore', the Senate's most senior member. As soon as the letter is sent, Pence would become 'acting president.' Alternatively, Congress could set up its own mechanism to decide if he is fit for office - maybe a commission, or a joint committee. Pence would still have to agree with its conclusion and then write formally to the Speaker and president pro tempore. Or another possibility is that the pool of 'principal officers' is considered to be bigger than the 15 and a majority of that group call Trump incapable. What if Trump does not agree? If Trump claims he is capable of holding office, he would write to the House Speaker and the president pro tempore of the Senate within four days, setting up three weeks of intense debate in both houses of Congress. Trump would be removed from office if both two-thirds majorities in both the House and Senate agreed with Pence and his cabal. If either of both chambers fell short of that mark, Trump would retain his powers and likely embark on a wholesale housecleaning, firing Pence and replacing disloyal Cabinet members. Are there any loopholes? The 25th Amendment allows Congress to appoint its own panel to evaluate the president instead of relying on the Cabinet – the men and women who work most closely with Trump – to decide on a course of action. It specifies that some 'other body as Congress may by law provide' could play that role, but Pence would still need to agree with any finding that the president is incapable of discharging his duties. That commission could hypothetically include anyone from presidential historians to psychiatrists, entrusted to assess the president's fitness for office. Another loophole is that it does not spell out that the Cabinet is needed to agree, but says that the 'principal officers' of the departments are needed. That term is undefined in the constitution. In some departments legislation appears to name not just the secretary but deputies and even undersecretaries as 'principal officers', so many more people could be called in to the assessment of Trump's fitness. But Trump's cabinet has a swathe of 'acting' cabinet officer - and it is unclear if they could therefore take part in removing him. Could Trump fire Pence if he rebelled? No. The vice president can resign or be impeached and removed - but he does not serve at the pleasure of the president. Is there any precedent for this? No. Only Section III, the voluntary surrender of presidential powers, has ever been used - and only very briefly. In December 1978, President Jimmy Carter thought about invoking Section III when he was contemplating a surgical procedure to remove hemorrhoids. Presidents Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush both voluntarily relinquished their powers while undergoing procedures under anesthetic. Section IV has also never been invoked, although there have been claims that Ronald Reagan's chief of staff Donald Regan told his successor, Howard Baker, in 1987 that he should be prepared to invoke it because Reagan was inattentive and inept. The PBS documentary 'American Experience' recounts how Baker and his team watched Reagan closely for signs of incapacity during their first meeting and decided he was in perfect command of himself.

McCarthy told Trump that he believes the president should call Biden and continue the tradition of meeting with him for a handover, prior to the inauguration.

He also said Trump should follow tradition and leave a welcome letter in the Resolute Desk for his successor.

Trump said he had not yet decided whether to do so.

Democrats are now poised to impeach Trump this week for 'inciting an insurrection.'

Some Republicans are expected to join Democrats in the vote to impeach Trump, but the U.S. Senate is unlikely to convene in time to consider the article before Trump leaves office at noon on Jan. 20.

In a memo to Republicans ahead of the call Monday, McCarthy told fellow lawmakers he does not back impeachment and suggested other measures, including censure of the president.

Republicans have been left deeply shaken and divided by Wednesday's events.

Some, such as Senators Lisa Murkowski and Pat Toomey, have said they want the president to resign.

Others are furious that it took Trump nearly 24 hours to release a video condemning the violence and lawlessness that overtook Capitol Hill, and saw the Senate chamber broken into by the mob.

They were further incensed by a report in The Washington Post, published on Monday, which claimed that Trump was slow to respond to their appeals for help because he was too gripped by live television coverage of the carnage.

The paper reported that McCarthy contacted Jared Kushner, Trump's son-in-law and senior adviser, while Senator Lindsey Graham phoned Ivanka Trump, the president's daughter, to beg for help.

Kellyanne Conway, a longtime Trump confidante and former White House senior adviser, called an aide who she knew was standing at the president's side.

Chris Christie, a close ally of the president's and a former governor of New Jersey, said he'd spent the last 25 minutes trying to reach Trump directly.

'The president caused this protest to occur; he's the only one who can make it stop,' Christie said.

'The president has to come out and tell his supporters to leave the Capitol grounds and to allow the Congress to do their business peacefully. And anything short of that is an abdication of his responsibility.'

The president still failed to react.

'He was hard to reach, and you know why? Because it was live TV,' said one close Trump adviser.

'If it's TiVo, he just hits pause and takes the calls. If it's live TV, he watches it, and he was just watching it all unfold.'

Trump watched with interest, pleased to see that his supporters were fighting so hard on his behalf, one close adviser told the paper.

Graham, one of Trump's strongest supporters, admitted that the president was slow to realize the magnitude of the problem.

'It took him awhile to appreciate the gravity of the situation,' Graham told the paper.

'The president saw these people as allies in his journey and sympathetic to the idea that the election was stolen.'

Mike Pence and Donald Trump met in the Oval Office on Monday night in a bid to repair their deeply-damaged relationship, which had been shredded by Wednesday's rioting.

Trump on Wednesday unleashed his followers on Pence, accusing his vice president of failing to support him in his bid to overthrow the election.

A mob of MAGA-hatted rioters stormed the Capitol and roamed the corridors calling for Pence to hang. A gallows was even set up outside Congress.

One high-profile Trump supporter, attorney Lin Wood, praised by Trump for doing 'good work' on election fraud, called for Pence to face the firing squad.

Yet on Monday evening Pence, who reportedly did not speak to Trump during or after the insurrection, was at the White House for a meeting described by aides as cordial.

CNN reported that Pence and his aides wanted to show that the country was not in total disarray.

'Need to telegraph to our allies and adversaries that we have a fully functioning government,' the source said.

John Roberts, Fox News' White House correspondent, tweeted a summary of the meeting

Fox News' White House correspondent, John Roberts, reported that a senior administration official said: 'The two had a good conversation, discussing the week ahead and reflecting on the last four years of the administration's work and accomplishments.'

The official said that the two men united in their contempt for the rioters, disowning those who stormed the Capitol.

'They reiterated that those who broke the law and stormed the Capitol last week do not represent the America First movement backed by 75 million Americans, and pledged to continue the work on behalf of the country for the remainder of their term.'

Pence, once known for his loyalty and subservience to the president, angered Trump both with his refusal to overturn the election, and with his announcement that he will attend Joe Biden's January 20 inauguration. Trump has confirmed he will not be there.

Pence, a devout Christian, infuriated Trump with his position on the election, and Trump tried repeatedly to change his mind.

'Do the courageous thing, Mike,' Trump said in one meeting, The Washington Post reported.

'It will be bad for you and for the country if you don't,' Trump said at another time, according to an official describing the meeting.

Marc Short, the vice president's chief of staff, began readying for an inevitable clash between the two men, a person who talked to him told the paper, and never considered that Pence could please the president.

Trump was attempting to convince Pence right until Wednesday morning, it was reported.

One former senior official told the paper that the rupture between the two men was highly unusual.

'The president could say, 'Mike I want you to go fly to Asia,' and he would do it, or 'Mike, I want you take over the coronavirus task force,' and he would do it, never questioned a thing,' said the former official.

'Pence would spend hours in the Oval. Pence would come in, he'd get his daily brief and then he'd get word of when the president would be coming into the Oval and then he'd go over there and they'd spend hours together.

'For them to not speak anymore is a paradigm I just never would have imagined.'

The meeting, however, appeared to suggest that the pair were attempting to patch things up, and that Pence was not going to press ahead with the 25th Amendment.

On Sunday it was reported that he had not yet made up his mind, although it was 'unlikely' he would press to remove the president.

On Monday, before their meeting, Nancy Pelosi and the House Democrats pressed ahead with the articles of impeachment.

Impeachment is scheduled for consideration at 9am Wednesday, if Trump refuses to resign and Pence won't initiate other procedures to remove him.

The impeachment effort itself will dominate the final week of Trump's presidency, and is almost certain to come to a historic result: the first time in history a president has been impeached twice.

Twitter stepped in to stop 'Hang Mike Pence' trending in the wake of the MAGA mob riot, after the phrase began trending on the platform in the early hours of Saturday morning.

The social media giant permanently banned Trump on Friday night, citing risks of 'further incitement to violence'.

A screenshot shows that of 1.26am, over 14,400 Twitter users had used the phrase.

Twitter confirmed in a statement to Newsweek that it had moved to block the phrase because it violated rules on trending subjects.

'We blocked the phrase and other variations of it from trending. We want trends to promote healthy discussions on Twitter. This means that at times, we may prevent certain content from trending,' a spokesperson said.

'As per our Help Center, there are Rules for trends - if we identify accounts that violate these rules, we'll take enforcement action.'

The phrase was no longer trending later in the day and it does not appear on the Twitter Trending USA site, which tracks trending topics.

On Twitter's Help Center, it has a rule to prevent violent threats against individuals as well as the glorification of violence.

The threatening phrase surfaced online in the wake of Wednesday's riot where Trump supporters - among them white supremacists, QAnon fanatics and Proud Boys - violently broke into the Capitol building in an attack that left five people dead.

Horrifying footage from the scene of the siege shows a mob chanting 'Hang Mike Pence' as they stormed the building.

A Reuters' photographer covering the riot also claimed he heard at least three Trump supporters speak about hanging the Vice President from a tree as a 'traitor'.

Jim Bourg, the Reuters News Pictures Editor in DC, tweeted Friday that he heard 'many more' speak about executing Pence as they stormed the Capitol and tried to hunt him down.

'I heard at least 3 different rioters at the Capitol say that they hoped to find Vice President Mike Pence and execute him by hanging him from a Capitol Hill tree as a traitor,' Bourg said.

Trump supporters scaled the walls of the Capitol and broke in, for the first time since 1814

Pence could certainly be forgiven for having little inclination to save Trump from the 25th Amendment.

While Pence was sheltering from the mob on Wednesday, Trump, at 2:24pm, tweeted: 'Mike Pence didn't have the courage to do what should have been done to protect our Country and our Constitution, giving States a chance to certify a corrected set of facts, not the fraudulent or inaccurate ones which they were asked to previously certify. USA demands the truth!'

Trump was watching the storming of the Capitol live on television, and left it to Pence to call up the National Guard and secure the building, according to multiple reports. Trump on Sunday took credit for summoning the reinforcements.

McConnell was evacuated from the Capitol, but praised Pence for his actions.

'Although the Vice President and I were not together during the evacuation, he personally got very involved and stayed in close contact with me as we worked to secure urgently needed resources to thwart the mob and I appreciate those efforts greatly,' McConnell said in a statement to The Washington Post.

McConnell told others he was enraged with Trump and planned to never speak to him again.

Pence skipped his speech to the Republican National Committee meeting, scheduled for the next day, and did not come to the White House.

He returned on Friday.

White House aides have been shocked and saddened by Trump's turning on Pence, The Washington Post reported.

One senior administration official described it as 'unconscionable, even for the president.'

'We're very lucky that Mike Pence is a decent guy and rational and levelheaded,' said Joe Grogan, the former head of the Domestic Policy Council under Trump.

He told the paper: 'If he had been replaced by someone as nuts as the people who have been surrounding the president as the primary advice givers for the last few months, we could have had even more of a bloodbath.

'Imagine what would have happened if Pence was devious and vile and didn't stand up for the Constitution.'

https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-10913721/Chair-January-6-committee-says-NO-plans-bring-criminal-charges-against-Trump.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ito=1490&ns_campaign=1490,1,"Members of the House committee investigating Trump's efforts to overturn his 2020 election defeat can't seem to make up their minds on whether to refer former President Donald Trump and his associates for criminal prosecution over their role in planning January 6 riot at the U.S. Capitol.

Members of the committee had called on Sunday for the US Justice Department to consider a criminal indictment, warning, 'the danger is still out there'.

But on Monday night, Chairman Bennie Thompson essentially ruled the matter out entirely, saying that it had no plans to make a referral to the DOJ.

""No, that's not our job,' Thompson said of referring Trump for criminal charges. 'Our job is to look at the facts and circumstances around January 6, what caused it and make recommendations after that.'

""We're going to tell the facts. If the Department of Justice looks at it, and assume that there's something that needs further review, I'm sure they'll do it,"" Thompson added.

Chairman of the House select committee investigating the January 6 attack on the US Capitol, Rep. Bennie Thompson, D-Miss, said the panel will not make any criminal referrals when it comes to former President Donald Trump

Chairman Bennie Thompson, D-Miss., as the House select committee investigating the January 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol continues to reveal its findings of a year-long investigation, on Capitol Hill in Washington, on Monday

He noted that the entirety of the committee's final report would be made public so that 'anybody can have access to it' - including the Department of Justice, which may decide to take independent action against Trump or those who assisted him in his attempts to overthrow the 2020 election.

'If they want, after reviewing it, to come back and ask to talk to some of the staff or the members who helped produce the report, I'm sure they will,' Thompson said.

At the same time, Attorney General Merrick Garland said that federal prosecutors are watching the hearings and the Justice Department will make the final decision on whether a formal criminal referral takes place.

'I am watching, and I will be watching all the hearings, although I may not be able to watch all of it live,' Garland said. 'But I will be sure that I am watching all of it. And I can assure you that the January 6 prosecutors are watching all of the hearings as well.'

Thompson's claim swiftly pushed back by panel members Liz Cheney and Adam Schiff saying no decision had been made

Rep. Liz Cheney (R-WY), vice chairwoman of the committee, was quick to walk back Thompson's statement Monday evening, saying that the committee had not reached any conclusion about 'potential criminal referrals.'

'The January 6th Select Committee has not issued a conclusion regarding potential criminal referrals. We will announce a decision on that at an appropriate time.'

Meanwhile, committee member and Democratic Rep. Adam Schiff (D-CA), said he believed that any decisions on criminal referrals would happen after the investigation concludes.

'We haven't had a discussion about that, so I don't know that the committee has reached a position on whether we make a referral or what the referrals might be,' Schiff told Anderson Cooper on CNN.

'I thought we were deferring that decision until we concluded our investigation. At least that's my understanding.'

Democratic Rep. Jamie Raskin of Maryland, said the panel is 'less concerned with whether or not there was a specific statutory offense committed than making clear to the public that there was no rational basis upon which anyone could conclude that (Trump) had actually won the election.'

A decision to prosecute will be up to the Justice Department, whether there is a formal criminal referral or not.

Garland has declined to comment on any of the new evidence being presented before the committee, noting that the DOJ does not comment on ongoing investigations.

'We do that both for the viability of our investigations and because it's the right thing to do with respect to the civil liberties of people under investigation.'

Donald Trump's daughter Ivanka Trump told the committee that it became 'increasingly clear' on election night that the vote count would extend for several days

Earlier on Monday, the committee revealed how Donald Trump shrugged off Jared Kushner's concerns about Rudy Giuliani's election fraud claims, the January 6 committee revealed in its second of six hearings on Monday.

The Democrat-led panel opened the hearing with videotaped depositions of Trump's advisers claiming he declared a premature victory on election night 2020 on the advise of a drunk Giuliani.

Vice Chair Rep. Liz Cheney said Trump 'rejected the advice of his campaign experts on election night' in favor of advice from 'an apparently inebriated Rudy Giuliani' who told him to declare victory that night and insist the vote count be stopped 'to falsely claim everything was fraudulent.'

The panel played audio of its investigators asking Kushner, for instance, what he said about the former New York City mayor's claims that Dominion Voting Systems was part of a vast conspiracy to rig its voting machines against Trump.

'Uh, basically, not the approach I would take if I was you,' Kushner said he told his father-in-law.

Trump dismissed him, insisting 'I have confidence in Rudy,' Kushner claimed.

Advisers' testimonies indicate that it was apparent within hours on election night that the vote count would take several days.

They were aware it could stretch from 'very early on,' according to his daughter and former White House adviser Ivanka Trump, Kushner's wife.

Lawmakers are suggesting that Trump's aides were dismissive of the election fraud claims being pushed by some of his allies, and that the former president continued pushing them despite warnings from both family and associates.

Cheney said at the outset of the hearing: 'Pay attention to what Donald Trump and his legal team said repeatedly about Dominion voting machines, far-flung conspiracies with a deceased Venezuelan communist allegedly pulling the strings.'

Former White House attorney Eric Herschmann said on video: 'What they were proposing, I thought, was nuts.'

Takeaways: Trump's mind was 'made up' of election fraud and his advisers describe the Giuliani factor The House panel investigating the Jan. 6, 2021 insurrection systemically made the case in its second hearing Monday that Trump and his advisers knew that his claims of fraud in the 2020 election were false. The argument is key to the committee's investigation as the nine-member panel details its evidence about what led to the violent insurrection. The rioters who broke into the Capitol that day and interrupted the certification of President Joe Biden's victory were echoing Trump's falsehoods that he, not Biden, had rightfully won the election. Takeaways from Monday's hearing: A witness pulls out, but video tells the story The hearing began with a scramble as Donald Trump's former campaign manager Bill Stepien, the panel's top Monday witness, said he would not appear due to a 'family emergency.' Committees chairman Mississippi Rep. Bennie Thompson said Stepien's wife was in labor. But the committee had a plan B - hours of Stepien's previous interview with the panel that was recorded on video. The committee aired multiple clips of that interview, along with others, as the hearing unfolded. Stepien told investigators that Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani was urging Trump to declare victory on election night, despite Stepien's warnings that it was 'way too early' to make a prediction like that. 'My belief, my recommendation, was to say that votes were still being counted, it's too early to tell, too early to call the race,' Stepien said in one clip. Trump went to the podium in the White House press room on election night and said that the early results were 'a fraud on the American public' and that 'frankly, we did win this election.' Trump's mind 'was made up' on election fraud and anyone who disagreed was 'weak' Trump's advisers told him repeatedly that he should wait on the results and should not declare that there was widespread election fraud. But Trump would not listen, and increasingly relied on wild claims that were pushed by Giuliani and Trump attorney Sidney Powell, among others, according to testimony. The panel showed video from Trump's daughter Ivanka Trump, her husband, Jared Kushner, and campaign aide Jason Miller. Ivanka Trump told the panel that 'it was clear' the election wouldn't be called on election night, and Kushner said he had told Trump at one point that Giuliani's advice was 'not the approach I would take.' Trump responded that he had confidence in Giuliani. Miller said there was a meeting on election night in which he told Trump that they shouldn't declare victory until they had a better sense of the numbers. But Trump told a room of advisers that anyone who didn't agree with Giuliani was being 'weak.' Stepien said his group of advisers was dubbed 'team normal' in contrast to the legal team pushing election fraud. Former Attorney General William Barr, who declared publicly at the time that there was no evidence behind Trump's fraud claims, said the president was increasingly becoming 'detached from reality.' Trump pushed multiple Attorneys General to pursue election fraud The committee made clear that Trump's quest to undermine the presidential election ran through two Justice Departments - one headed by Bill Barr, the other by Acting Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen. Trump had attempted to have Rosen replaced with a loyalist who would have directed election officials in states narrowly won by Joe Biden to send in an alternate slate of electoral votes. Barr's videotaped testimony suggests he told Trump that Giuliani and Powell's election fraud claims were 'crazy stuff,' singling out the Dominion Voting Systems allegations as 'among the most disturbing allegations.' 'Disturbing in the sense that I saw absolutely zero basis for the allegations. But they were made in such a sensational way that they obviously were influencing a lot of people,' Barr said. 'Members of the public, that there was this systemic corruption in the system and that their votes didn't count and that these machines controlled by somebody else... which was complete nonsense.' And after his departure, then-Acting Attorney General testified to the committee that he had to tell Trump that his legal teams' claims that there was rampant voter fraud in Fulton County, Georgia were 'just not true.' 'I told the president myself that - several times in several conversations - that these allegations about ballots being smuggled in - in a suitcase, and run through the machine several times, it was not true,' Rosen said. A monthslong campaign seeding doubt in the 2020 election Trump's claims of fraud did not start after election day. The committee showed clips where Trump previewed his strategy in speeches throughout his 2020 campaign. In August of that year, he told an audience that fraud was the only way he would lose. Stepien told the committee that he and House GOP Leader Kevin McCarthy had met with Trump in the summer of 2020 and made a two-pronged case for why he should stop criticizing mail-in voting. He and McCarthy told Trump that he was leaving 'a lot to chance' and that there were GOP party workers on the ground who could help get mail-in votes for Trump. McCarthy, who has declined to cooperate with the Jan. 6 panel despite a subpoena, was 'echoing the same argument,' Stepien said. 'But the president's mind was made up,' Stepien said. The election night 'Red Mirage' Chris Stirewalt, a former political editor for Fox News Channel, testified in person at the hearing. Stirewalt made the election night call that President Joe Biden won Arizona - a moment that prompted 'anger and disappointment' in Trump's circle at the White House, Miller said. Stirewalt explained that the network, along with others, had expected that there would be a so-called 'red mirage' at the beginning of the evening as in-person Republican votes came in, and many of the mail-in votes that would be counted later on would lean Democratic. He noted it happens every election. Trump had not only exploited that pattern to make false claims of fraud, but contributed to it in his campaign to call mail-in voting into question. 'We had gone to pains, and I'm proud of the pains, we went to, to make sure that we were informing viewers that this was going to happen because the Trump campaign and the president had made it clear that they were going to try to exploit this anomaly,' Stirewalt said.

Barr told Trump election fraud claims were 'crazy stuff' in White House meeting where he thought the ex-president would fire him

Barr said he told the president that the election fraud theories he and Giuliani were pushing were 'crazy stuff' and that 'they were wasting their time on and doing a great, great disservice to the country.'

He claimed the former president's fraud claims came 'right out of the box on election night' in the previously unseen video.

'I went over there and I told my secretary that I thought I would probably be fired,' Barr said in the video, describing a previously-planned White House meeting. 'I said, you might have to pack up for me.'

Barr said Trump was 'as mad as I've ever seen him' after the then-attorney general told the Associated Press that he saw no proof of widespread election fraud.

'You didn't have to say this. You must have said this because you hate Trump. You hate Trump,' Barr said Trump told him.

The former Justice official said he raised Trump and his allies' claims about Dominion Voting Systems in particular, finding them 'among the most disturbing allegations.'

'Disturbing in the sense that I saw absolutely zero basis for the allegations. But they were made in such a sensational way that they obviously were influencing a lot of people,' Barr said. 'Members of the public, that there was this systemic corruption in the system and that their votes didn't count and that these machines controlled by somebody else... which was complete nonsense.'

'And it was being laid out there and I told them that it was - it was crazy stuff, and they were wasting their time on that. And it was doing great, great disservice to the country.'

He said Trump's election fraud claims were mounting every day, comparing them to a game of whack-a-mole.

''There was an avalanche of all these allegations of fraud that built up over a number of days and it was like playing Whack-a-Mole because something would come out one day and then the next day it would be another issue,' Barr said.

Audio testimony from Acting Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen, who took office after Barr's departure at the end of December, shows the former president pursued his fraud claims after Barr left but was again rebuffed by his own Justice officials.

Rosen told the committee he let Trump know the allegations of fraud in Georgia were 'just not true.'

'I told the president myself that - several times in several conversations - that these allegations about ballots being smuggled in - in a suitcase, and run through the machine several times, it was not true,' Rosen said.

Trump advisers suggest Giuliani pulled the strings on election night

Playing a video deposition from the former New York Mayor himself, Giuliani takes a large sip of water before answering that 'yes' he was at the White House residence in the early morning hours of November 4.

'It went over beyond midnight, yes,' Giuliani said.

The panel also played video from the deposition of former Trump campaign manager Bill Stepien, who dropped out of the hearing at the last minute after his wife went into labor.

Stepien told House investigators that he had heard Giuliani was 'upstairs' in a reception area looking to 'talk to the president.'

He recalled huddling with former Trump adviser Jason Miller, Justin Clarke and ex-Chief of Staff Mark Meadows 'to listen to whatever Rudy presumably wanted to say to the president.'

Miller was asked if he observed anyone in that meeting had too much to drink - to which he named Giuliani as well.

Asked if he himself recalled the meeting, Giuliani told House investigators: 'I - I - I mean I spoke to the president. They may have been present. But I spoke to the president several times that night.'

Miller, however, was more direct in laying the blame at the former Trump lawyer's feet.

'There were suggestions, by I believe it was Mayor Giuliani, to go and declare victory and say that we'd won it outright,' the former Trump adviser said on video.

He said Giuliani made clear that 'everyone who didn't agree with that position was being weak.'

Stepien said he encouraged Trump to say: 'It's too early to tell, too early to call the race. But you know, we are proud of the race we we ran and we think we're in in good position. And we'll have more to say about this.'

He said Trump disagreed with that plan.

Trump did hold an unprecedented press conference at the White House on election night where he claimed with absolutely no proof that the vote count was rife with 'fraud on the American public.'

Later on Stepien's testimony showed that member of Trump's orbit knew they were facing defeat even as the ex-president continued to claim victory.

'You know, I, we told him, the group that went over there, outlined, you know, my belief in, in chances for success at this point and then we pegged it at, you know, 5, maybe, maybe, 10 percent based on recounts that were, you know, either were automatically initiated or could be initiated based on, you know, realistic legal challenges, not all the legal challenges that eventually were pursued,' the former campaign manager claimed.

'Are you out of your effing mind?': White House lawyer says he dismissed pro-Trump lawyer John Eastman's election fraud theories

Former White House lawyer Eric Herschmann was among the bluntest to rebuff Trump and his allies' election fraud claims.

'Are you out of your effing mind?' Herschmann recalled asking pro-Trump lawyer John Eastman in his videotaped deposition. 'I only want to hear two words coming out of your mouth from now on: orderly transition'

'There was never an indication of interest in what the actual facts were': Top quotes from the second January 6 hearing 'The mayor was definitely intoxicated': Former Trump advisor Jason Miller on Rudy Giuliani 'I don't know that I had a firm view of what he should say': Ivanka Trump on what her father should say on election night when it was too early to call the result 'Right out of the box on election night, the President claimed that there was major fraud underway. I mean, this happened, as far as I could tell, before there was actually any potential of looking at evidence': Former Attorney General Bill Barr 'Very, very, very, very bleak': Trump's former campaign manager Bill Stepien on their chances of winning the 2020 election 'I told him that the stuff his people were shoveling out to the public was bulls***': Barr on election fraud claims. 'There was never an indication of interest in what the actual facts were': Barr on Trump's attitude to fraud claims. 'The 2020 election was not close': Republican campaign lawyer Bens Ginsberg Advertisement

While the clip lacks context, Eastman is known for authoring a memo that outlined a false theory presented to former Vice President Mike Pence on how he could unilaterally overturn the 2020 election results.

In another portion of his taped testimony, Herschmann explained why he believed election fraud theories about Dominion Voting Systems being pushed by Giuliani and fellow pro-Trump lawyer Sidney Powell were 'completely nuts.'

'It was a combination of Italians and Germans, I mean, different things have been floating around as to who was involved - I remember Hugo Chavez, and the Venezuelans, and she has an affidavit from somebody who says they wrote a software or something in the Philippines. It was just all over the radar,' the former White House attorney said.

Those same claims are currently at the heart of separate $1.3 billion lawsuits from Dominion against Giuliani and Powell, among others.

Former Philadelphia official received death threats after being targeted by Trump

The committee honed in on Giuliani's role in pushing Trump's election fraud claims in the second half of its hearing, featuring testimony from former officials in Georgia and Pennsylvania. Both states narrowly went to Biden in 2020 and were lightening rods for the ex-president's attempts to overturn the vote count.

One of those officials, Philadelphia city commissioner Al Schmidt, testified on Monday that he and his family were subjected to 'disturbing threats' after the former president singled him out by name for his refusal to go along with his election fraud demands.

'The threats prior to that tweet – and on some level it feels almost silly to talk about a tweet – but we can really see the impact that they have, because prior to that, the threats were pretty general in nature. 'Corrupt election officials in Philadelphia are going to get what's coming to them'; 'You're what the Second Amendment is for'; 'You're walking into the lion's den.' All sorts of things like that,' Schmidt explained during his testimony in person to the panel on Monday.

'After the president tweeted at me by name, calling me out the way that he did, the threats became much more specific, much more graphic,' he said, adding that they 'included not just me by name, but included members of my family by name, their ages, our address, pictures of our home, just every bit of detail that you can imagine.'

'That was what changed with that tweet.'

January 6 select committee member Zoe Lofgren placed on the screen redacted versions of threats that Schmidt had received after the former president's tweet.

'You lied. You a traitor (sic). Perhaps 75cuts and 20bullets will soon arrive,' one text read, mentioning the name of one of his family members.

The same individual sent a second message with: 'You betrayed your country.'

A separate email sent to Schmidt's wife's account threatening that the Philadelphia commissioner would be 'fatally shot.'

'Heads on spikes,' the message said in all caps along with the hashtag 'Q' – a likely reference to the conspiracy QAnon.

Giuliani rages at 'hysterical Liz Cheney during the hearing

The former New York City mayor appeared on an episode of former Trump adviser Steve Bannon's podcast as the January 6 committee's second hearing was underway, where he claimed the Democrat-led panel had 'no case' but did not explain further why he believed so.

'The millions of hours they've spent trying to find a crime on Donald Trump and they can't do it. They started this frame about five years ago,' Giuliani said on Steve Bannon's podcast.

'It's the same cast - Bennie Thompson, and shifty Adam Schiff, you see Swalwell in the background. The completely hysterical Liz Cheney, who has gone off her deep end.'

Committee begins second hearing after lawmakers make clear they believe Trump committed criminal offenses

'This morning, we'll tell the story of how Donald Trump lost an election, and knew he lost an election, and as a result of his loss decided to wage an attack on our democracy,' Chairman Rep. Bennie Thompson said in his opening statement.

Former ABC News president James Goldston was seen arriving on Capitol Hill Monday morning ahead of the second hearing.

Axios reported last week that lawmakers recruited Goldston - who also helmed Good Morning America and Nightline as executive producer - to shape their mountains of evidence into a 'blockbuster' presentation.

The most highly-anticipated testimony was expected to come from former Trump campaign manager Bill Stepien, but he was forced to withdraw less than an hour before the hearing was meant to start after his wife went into labor.

'Mr. Stepien was in town and preparing for his testimony here today in response to a subpoena when he got a call that his wife had gone into labor. He notified committee council and he immediately headed to hospital to be with her,' his lawyer told reporters outside of the hearing room.

The first hearing, held last Thursday at 8 p.m. Eastern Time, featured testimony from Capitol police officer Caroline Edwards and documentary filmmaker Nick Quested.

Edwards' moving testimony captured the night, as she compared the Capitol to a 'war zone' and recalled 'slipping in people's blood' as she defended the building from Trump's mob of violent supporters - experiencing a traumatic brain injury in the process.

That session was led chiefly by chairman Thompson, a Democrat, and Republican vice chair Cheney.

It also featured excerpts from videotaped depositions with former Attorney General Bill Barr and Trump's daughter and White House adviser, Ivanka, both making clear they believed at the time that there was no widespread fraud.

Multiple members of the select committee suggested they gathered enough evidence to bring criminal charges against Trump over the weekend. Appearing across a slew of Sunday news programs, panel members made clear that they hope Attorney General Merrick Garland is paying close attention to their hearings.

'I would like to see the Justice Department investigate any credible allegation of criminal activity on the part of Donald Trump or anyone else,' committee member Rep. Adam Schiff said on ABC News' This Week.

He later added: 'They need to be investigated if there's credible evidence, which I think there is.'

Rep. Jamie Raskin, meanwhile, said he doesn't want to 'browbeat' Garland but noted the committee has already laid out criminal statutes they believe Trump violated through a series of court filings.

'I think that he knows, his staff knows, the US attorneys know, what's at stake here,' Raskin told CNN's State of the Union.

'They know the importance of it, but I think they are rightfully paying close attention to precedent in history as well, as the facts of this case.'

Rep. Elaine Luria said the committee's hearings would focus heavily on Trump's 'dereliction of duty,' particularly during the 187 minute-gap between when the former president's supporters first broke into the Capitol and when he called them off.

'We've pieced together a very comprehensive tick tock timeline of what he did. And then 187 minutes, you know, this man had the microphone; he could speak to the whole country. His duty was to stand up and say something and try to stop this,' Luria said on NBC's Meet the Press.

'So, we'll talk about that and what I see to be his dereliction of duty, and he had a duty to act.'

During their first hearing the panel contextualized the January 6 attack into a wider alleged plot by Trump and his allies to overturn the 2020 presidential election.

https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/aug/10/belarus-opposition-candidate-rejects-election-result-protests-svetlana-tikhanovskaya-lukashenko,1,"Belarus’s opposition has issued a message of defiance, rejecting the results of a presidential election marred by vote-rigging as the country braced for a second night of protests against President Alexander Lukashenko.

“I will believe my own eyes – the majority was for us,” Svetlana Tikhanovskaya told reporters in the capital, Minsk, on Monday, after widespread reports of vote-tampering in Sunday’s election.

Tikhanovskaya said she considered herself the winner, not Lukashenko, and described the election as massively rigged. “The authorities should think about how to peacefully hand over power to us,” she said. “I consider myself the winner of this election.”

Her aides said the opposition wanted a vote recount at polling stations where there were reports of vote tampering. They also said the opposition wanted to hold talks with authorities about how to bring about a peaceful change of power.

Lukashenko, who is facing the deepest crisis of his 26 years in power, has threatened to crush any illegal rallies. He claimed that the protests were being directed from abroad, singling out Poland, Britain, and the Czech Republic.

Tikhanovskaya has stopped short of joining street protests and her team released a statement on Monday evening saying they feared her appearance could lead to “provocations”.

But the harrowing scenes of violence on the streets of Minsk and dozens more Belarusian cities are expected to bring more people on to the streets on Monday evening, with rallies anticipated to begin at 7pm.

The protests have largely been decentralised, with no clear leader, although popular bloggers on social media have played an important role in their coordination. Protesters organising over Telegram channels discussed bringing protective gear such as goggles and first-aid kits as they expected fresh clashes with riot police armed with batons, rubber bullets, water cannon and stun grenades.

The country’s election commission reported late on Monday that Lukashenko had won 80.08% of the vote while Tikhanovskaya took just 10.09%, despite a popular wave of support for the opposition candidate, whose political rallies have drawn some of the country’s largest crowds since the days of the Soviet Union.

Similar, preliminary results released on Sunday prompted unprecedented protests in cities across the country, posing the greatest threat to Lukashenko – often referred to as Europe’s last dictator – since he came to power. Foreign observers have not declared a Belarusian election free and fair since 1995.

Police detained about 3,000 people in Sunday’s bloody clashes, the Belarusian interior ministry said, with more than 2,000 of them in the country’s regions, where support for Lukashenko is higher than in the capital.

Lukashenko declared on Monday that he would put down the opposition rallies, calling the protesters “sheep” under foreign control who were “wanting to spoil the holiday”.

“I warned that there wouldn’t be a maidan, however much some people want that,” Lukashenko said on Monday, referring to a popular uprising in Ukraine that toppled a pro-Kremlin leader in 2014. “People need to settle down, calm down,” he said.

Lukashenko’s victory was quickly endorsed by Xi Jinping of China and Vladimir Putin of Russia, who has feuded with Lukashenko in recent weeks. In a congratulatory message, Putin urged Lukashenko to consider further economic and legal integration with Russia, which the opposition has warned would undermine Belarus’s sovereignty.

The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, stopped short of congratulating Lukashenko and in a statement called for restraint and an end to street violence which took place in more than 20 cities on Monday in the largest mass protest since Lukashenko took power in 1994.

A reporter for the Guardian saw police use water cannon and rubber bullets against protesters, while photographs showed field medics tending to bloodied protesters with wounds from batons and rubber bullets. One protester said the elections results were a “spit in the face”.

“It’s certainly the biggest protest I’ve ever seen in Belarus since Lukashenko came to power,” said David Marples, a professor at the University of Alberta and an expert on Belarus. “In terms of the elections that Lukashenko’s held, there’s been nothing like it. It seems to me that the whole country really is in favour of change.”

Video and photographs of the clashes also showed police using Czech-made stun grenades. The manufacturer denied on Monday that it had sold the devices to Belarus, which is under an arms embargo. Protesters have also been contending with a shutdown of the internet, as well as blocking of independent Belarusian news sites.

Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European commission, called for Belarus to publish accurate results, and condemned the violence against opposition supporters. “Harassment and violent repression of peaceful protesters has no place in Europe,” she said.

Analysts said it was the deepest crisis Lukashenko had faced in his career. He was already facing unprecedented anger over his handling of the economy and a bungled coronavirus response. Before the elections he jailed opposition candidates and targeted foreign allies, accusing Moscow of sending mercenaries to destabilise the country.

Tikhanovskaya was initially a stand-in candidate for her husband, a popular YouTuber jailed earlier in the year. She has grown into an effective campaigner, attracting more than 63,000 people to a rally last month in Minsk, and thousands more in small cities and towns usually dominated by Lukashenko.

She has been joined on stage by two other female politicians in a “trio” that has transformed the image of the country’s male-dominated politics.",Belarus opposition candidate rejects election result after night of protests,1

https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-12482727/Proud-Boys-Enrique-Tarrio-sentence.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490,1,"Former Proud Boys national chairman Enrique Tarrio will be sentenced on Tuesday afternoon for his role in a plot to attack the U.S. Capitol in a failed bid to stop the transfer of power from Donald Trump to Joe Biden.

Tarrio, 39, is the final leader of the neo-fascist group convicted of seditious conspiracy in the January 6, 2021, attack to receive his punishment and faces 33 years in prison.

Three fellow Proud Boys found guilty by a Washington D.C. jury of the rarely used sedition charge were sentenced last week to prison terms ranging from 15 to 18 years - less than prosecutors wanted.

The Justice Department has asked for Tarrio to spend more than three decades in prison, describing him as the ringleader of a plot to use violence to shatter the cornerstone of American democracy and overturn the election victory by Joe Biden, a Democrat, over Trump, the Republican incumbent.

The far-right propagandist wasn't in Washington on January 6 - he was arrested two days earlier in a separate case - but prosecutors say he helped put in motion and encourage the violence that stunned the world and interrupted Congress' certification of Biden's electoral victory.

Former Proud Boys national chairman Enrique Tarrio was found guilty for his role in the January 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol

Proud Boys leader Enrique Tarrio (pictured with Joseph Biggs) was found guilty of seditious conspiracy over January 6 riot in 2021

Tarrio was convicted in May of conspiring to block the transfer of presidential power in the hopes of keeping Republican Donald Trump in the White House after he lost the 2020 election

Tarrio discussed 'revolutions' and 'storming' the Capitol complex prior to January 6, but was arrested upon entry into the capital on January 5, 2021 for a prior offense of burning the Black Lives Matter flag and on several weapons charges.

The Miami native was supposed to be sentenced last week in Washington's federal court, but his hearing was delayed because Judge Timothy Kelly got sick.

Kelly, who was nominated to the bench by Trump, sentenced Tarrio's co-defendants to lengthy prison terms - though far shorter than prosecutors were seeking.

Self-described Proud Boys organizer Joe Biggs sobbed as he was sentenced to 17 years on Thursday for his role in the riot after pleading for leniency to take care of his daughter and ailing mother.

Judge Kelly wasn't having it, as he said Americans are the envy of the world and U.S. elections must be respected, telling Biggs: 'You did play a role in riling up the crowd.

'If you don’t like how an election is being conducted... you can speak out, call, write or meet with election officials. You can engage in peaceful protest. File a lawsuit.'

The judge ruled that Biggs qualified for a terrorism sentencing enhancement because he teared down a fence that stood between police and rioters.

Ethan Nordean, who prosecutors said was the Proud Boys' leader on the ground on January 6, was sentenced to 18 years in prison, tying the record for the longest sentence in the attack.

Prosecutors had asked for 27 years for Nordean, who was a Seattle-area Proud Boys chapter president.

Oath Keepers founder Stewart Rhodes, who was found guilty of seditious conspiracy in a separate case, was sentenced in May to 18 years in prison. Prosecutors, who had sought 25 years for Rhodes, are appealing his sentence and the punishments of other members of his antigovernment militia group.

'Tarrio has repeatedly and publicly indicated that he has no regrets about what he helped make happen on January 6,' prosecutors wrote in court documents.

Lawyers for the Proud Boys deny that there was any plot to attack the Capitol or stop the transfer of presidential power.

'There is zero evidence to suggest Tarrio directed any participants to storm the U.S. Capitol building prior to or during the event,' his attorneys wrote in court papers.

'Participating in a plan for the Proud Boys to protest on January 6 is not the same as directing others on the ground to storm the Capitol by any means necessary.'

Police arrested Tarrio in Washington on Jan. 4, 2021, on charges that he defaced a Black Lives Matter banner during an earlier rally in the nation´s capital, but law enforcement officials later said he was arrested in part over concerns about the potential for unrest during the certification. He complied with a judge´s order to leave the city after his arrest.

On Jan. 6, dozens of Proud Boys leaders, members and associates were among the first rioters to breach the Capitol. The mob´s assault overwhelmed police, forced lawmakers to flee the House and Senate floors and disrupted the joint session of Congress for certifying Biden´s victory.

The backbone of the government´s case was hundreds of messages exchanged by Proud Boys in the days leading up to Janury 6.

As Proud Boys swarmed the Capitol, Tarrio cheered them on from afar, writing on social media: 'Do what must be done.' In a Proud Boys encrypted group chat later that day someone asked what they should do next.

Tarrio responded: 'Do it again.'

Tarrio wrote 'Do what must be done' on social media as they swarmed the Capitol, and when asked what they should do next, he replied: 'Do it again'

Prosecutors argued the Proud Boys were at the front lines of the mob on Capitol grounds and were there when the first barriers were breached

'Make no mistake,' Tarrio wrote in another message. 'We did this.'

Tarrio led the neo-fascist group - known for street fights with left-wing activists - when Trump infamously told the Proud Boys to 'stand back and stand by' during his first debate with Joe Biden.

During the month long trial, prosecutors argued that the Proud Boys viewed themselves as foot soldiers fighting for Trump as the Republican spread lies that Democrats stole the election from him.

Attorneys argued that members of the group were prepared to go to war to keep their preferred leader in power.

Defense lawyers denied there was any plot to attack the Capitol or stop Congress' certification of Biden's win.

The investigation has become the largest for the Justice Department in American history, and it hadn't tried a seditious conspiracy case in over a decade.

The riots followed months of false claims by Trump and his allies that the election had been rigged against him.

A select House committee investigated the riots and in its final report accused Trump of a criminal conspiracy to overturn the results of the 2020 election.

The committee estimated that from the election to Jan. 6, the president and aides made hundreds of efforts to pressure officials to overturn the results.

Trump supporters surround a noose and a gallows near the Capitol, on January 6

Targets included states he lost but that had GOP-led legislatures such as Michigan, Pennsylvania, Georgia, and Arizona.

Trump has since been indicted for this role in the riots, with a grand jury indictment accusing him of spreading 'lies' and 'sham' investigations while stoking an 'angry' mob on January 6.

Special Counsel Jack Smith said in a televised public statement following the release of the indictment that the attack on the Capitol was 'fueled by lies' made by Trump 'targeted at obstructing the bedrock function of the U.S. government - the nation's process of collecting, counting and certifying the results of the presidential election.' He pledged that his office will conduct a 'speedy' trial.

Trump is facing four counts including conspiracy to defraud the U.S. government and obstruct the electoral count for trying to overturn the 2020 election. The 45-page indictment says he was 'determined to remain in power' despite 'having lost.'

He and his six co-conspirators 'used knowingly false claims of election fraud' to try to 'subvert the legitimate election results and change electoral votes' to take down Joe Biden, according to the indictment.

The singer and actress, who was the first black woman to be crowned Miss America, will perform the song 'Lift Every Voice and Sing' while hosting PBS's 41st 'A Capitol Fourth' annual celebration, which airs Sunday.

The song was first written as a poem in 1900 by NAACP leader James Weldon Johnson and has long held the nickname as the 'Black National Anthem.'

Williams said her performance of the song will not only honor the nation's traditional Independence Day, but also the country's newly designated holiday.

'It's in celebration of the wonderful opportunity that we now have to celebrate Juneteenth. So we are reflective of the times,' she told the Associated Press.

The song is not replacing the US National Anthem, with Grammy Award-winning singer Renée Fleming opening the show with a special performance of the traditional tune.

Several other singers and musicians will also be performing a variety of different tunes during the celebration including Gladys Knight, Jimmy Buffet, Cynthia Erivo and Alan Jackson.

But the inclusion of the 'Black National Anthem' has sparked controversy on social media.

Some social media users hit out at the announcement, calling it 'divisive' and a contradiction of efforts to create 'unity.'

'I view this as divisive creating a culture only caring about skin color, makes her a useful Fool for the left!' one person tweeted.

Another person wrote: 'If you want unity, a black national anthem doesn't sound like it.

'Vanessa Williams will be performing that song (whatever the hell it is) at the Capitol Fourth celebration.'

Some slammed the move as 'ridiculous' and 'woke', accusing the inclusion of the song as a way to 'create racism.'

'This is ridiculous. There is no black America. There is no 'Black National Anthem' as there is not a black nation,' one person tweeted.

'There is one nation under God. Everything this woke culture does is something to divide us. I will not be watching as you create racism.'

Others hit out at the celebration of Juneteenth on July 4 that is 'for ALL Americans.'

'What a farce! July 4th is for ALL Americans regardless of race. Not singing the National Anthem is discriminatory toward everyone who is NOT black,' one person wrote.

'July 4th is not the childish Juneteenth but the national day of celebrating our Independence.'

'Well isn't that cute. That will really bring country together,' added another.

'So every skin color & nationality should have its own national Anthem? So where do you stop?'

Juneteenth commemorates the official end of slavery in the US when the last group of enslaved African Americans learned of their freedom under President Abraham Lincoln's 1863 Emancipation Proclamation.

Joe Biden signed a bill into law two days before the celebration last month, declaring it the first Juneteenth National Independence Day.

A total of 14 House Republicans voted against the bill to make it a federal holiday with some arguing it would divide Americans based on race and have them choose between celebrating Juneteenth or July 4 - an argument some appeared to push online over Williams' song choice.

Others questioned why Williams was not performing the US National Anthem.

'This name needlessly divides our nation': The arguments from GOP lawmakers against Juneteenth National Independence Day Juneteenth, the day marking the emancipation of slaves in the US, was finally made a federal holiday last month after 155 years. Joe Biden signed a bill into law two days before the celebration, declaring it the first Juneteenth National Independence Day. While the Senate unanimously passed the bill, a total of 14 House Republicans voted against making it a federal holiday. Some voting against it claimed it would divide Americans based on race and have them choose between celebrating Juneteenth or July 4. Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky claimed: 'Naming this day 'National Independence Day' would create confusion and push Americans to pick one of those two days as their independence day based on their racial identity.' Rep. Chip Roy of Texas made a similar argument: 'This name needlessly divides our nation on a matter that should instead bring us together by creating a separate Independence Day based on the color of one's skin.' Rep. Andy Biggs objected to the phrase Independence Day in the holiday's formal name and said he would have voted for it if it was called 'Juneteenth National Emancipation Day.' Advertisement

'A long time admirer of Vanessa Williams. Why not the National Anthem Vanessa?' one person wrote.

However, other people celebrated the news of Williams singing the song, saying 'Lift Every Voice and Sing' is the 'only national anthem' they will recognize.

'Vanessa Williams....that's the only national anthem I'll acknowledge on the 4th,' one person wrote.

'I'm always happy to hear Vanessa Williams sing anything at all, but this I am especially looking forward to!' added another.

Several others mocked the people up in arms over the song, pointing out that the song has been around for a century and that the 'Black National Anthem' is simply a nickname.

'So many of my fellow white people shedding so many white tears over the 'controversy' of Vanessa Williams singing a song at the 4th of July shindig tomorrow...' one person wrote.

'You gotta love it...! So much manufactured outrage! My advice? Get over it. Seriously.'

Another person agreed, writing: 'White people being up in arms about Vanessa Williams performing Lift Every Voice and Sing is really interesting. This song has existed as the Black National Anthem for over 100 years.

'They really have no clue about Black culture, while we know them better than they realize.'

Another person questioned how Americans have not heard the song before: 'Ma'am... Are you seriously trying to tell us you've never heard of 'Lift Every Voice and Sing' aka 'The Black National Anthem'?

'And why are you going after Vanessa Williams? She isn't the one who dubbed the song with this nickname.'

Meanwhile, one person posted a photo of some of the pro-Trump mob who stormed the US Capitol on January 6 in a violent riot that left five dead.

'Actual photos of the people pissed about the Black national anthem,' they wrote.

'Karen would like to speak to Vanessa Williams manager.'

Williams said her performance of the song will not only honor the nation's traditional Independence Day, but also the country's newly designated holiday

In his fiercest criticism yet of the former-President's role in the insurrection attempt, Biden said Trump watched the events unfold 'in the comfort of the [White House] private dining room' while law enforcement officers were attacked by his supporters.

'Every day we rely on law enforcement to save lives,' Biden said in a prerecorded speech to the National Organization of Black Law Enforcement Executives' annual conference in Orlando, Florida.

'Then, on Jan. 6, we relied on law enforcement to save our democracy,' he said.

Biden, who remains in isolation in the family quarters of the White House after testing positive for COVID-19 last week, has previously slammed Trump for helping to incite the mob on Jan. 6, 2021, with a 'web of lies' about the 2020 presidential election being marred by widespread voter fraud that never actually occurred.

But his comments to the conference were the clearest link Biden has made between Trump and the insurrection since a House committee investigating the attack on the Capitol began holding hearings in June as part of its work to investigate the riots.

In his fiercest criticism yet of the former-President's role in the insurrection attempt, Biden said Trump watched the events unfold 'in the comfort of the [White House] private dining room' while law enforcement officers were attacked by his supporters (pictured)

'You saw what happened. The Capitol police, the D.C Metropolitan police, other law enforcement agencies were attacked and assaulted before our very eyes.'

Officers were 'Speared, sprayed, stomped on, brutalized,' said Biden, whose voice is still raspy and deeper than usual as he recovers from the effects of the coronavirus.

'Lives were lost. And for three hours, the defeated former president of the United States watched it all happen as he sat in the comfort of the private dining room next to the Oval Office.'

He added that while Trump was 'doing that, brave law enforcement officers are subject to the medieval hell for three hours.'

That referenced Cassidy Hutchinson, a former Trump administration White House aide, testifying before the House Jan. 6 committee about Trump's temper as he sat in his dining room and watched TV as his plans to overturn the election fell apart.

Biden didn't mention the committee's work specifically during the taped address and has previously largely avoided the topic.

He said after its opening hearing that the work was about allowing 'no one to place a dagger at the throat of our democracy,' but also noted then that he'd not had time to watch the first installment.

The committee held its final summer hearing last week, which focused on Trump's failing to help disperse attackers overrunning the Capitol - even as top aides and members of his family implored him to call for an end to the violence.

White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre had suggested previously that, while Biden had been able to tune in occasionally to the committee's work, he hadn't been able to focus much on the proceedings as he concentrated on doing his job as president.

Whether Biden has had more time to watch as he recovers from COVID-19 is unclear.

Trump plans to be in Washington on Tuesday to address the America First Agenda Summit, the first time he's returned to the nation's capital since leaving office.

Jean-Pierre offered no comment about that speech on Monday, saying, 'I don't know what he's coming to talk about.'

In his pre-taped comments, Biden noted that law enforcement officers during the insurrection were 'dripping in blood, surrounded by carnage, face-to-face with a crazed mob that believed the lies of the defeated president.'

'The police were heroes that day. Donald Trump lacked the courage to act,' the president said.

'The brave women and men in blue all across this nation should never forget that. You can't be pro-insurrection and pro-cop. You can't be pro-insurrection and pro-democracy. You can't be pro-insurrection and pro-American.'

Trump will address the America First Policy Institute's two-day America First Agenda Summit as some advisers urge him to spend more time talking about his vision for the future and less time relitigating the 2020 election as he prepares to announce an expected 2024 White House campaign.

'I believe it will be a very policy-focused, forward-leaning speech, very much like a State of the Union 5.0,' said Brooke Rollins, AFPI's president.

Composed of former Trump administration officials and allies, the nonprofit is widely seen as an 'administration in waiting' that could quickly move to the West Wing if Trump were to run again and win.

Trump's appearance in Washington comes as his potential 2024 rivals have been taking increasingly overt steps to challenge his status as the party's standard-bearer.

They include former Vice President Mike Pence, who has been touting his own 'Freedom Agenda' in speeches that serve as an implicit contrast with Trump.

'Some people may choose to focus on the past, but I believe conservatives must focus on the future. If we do, we won't just win the next election, we will change the course of American history for generations,' Pence had planned to say in a speech at the Heritage Foundation in Washington on the eve of Trump's visit.

Pence's appearance was postponed because of bad weather, but he will be delivering his own speech Tuesday morning before the Young America's Foundation not far from the AFPI meeting.

Trump has spent much of his time since leaving office fixated on the 2020 election and spreading lies about his loss to sow doubt about Biden's victory.

Indeed, even as the Jan. 6 committee was laying bare his desperate and potentially illegal attempts to remain in power and his refusal to call off a violent mob of his supporters as they tried to halt the peaceful transition of power, Trump continued to try to pressure officials to overturn Biden's win, despite there being no legal means to decertify the past election.

On Tuesday, he plans to focus on public safety.

'President Trump sees a nation in decline that is driven, in part, by rising crime and communities becoming less safe under Democrat policies,' said his spokesman, Taylor Budowich.

'His remarks will highlight the policy failures of Democrats, while laying out an America First vision for public safety that will surely be a defining issue during the midterms and beyond.'

Beyond the summit, staff at the America First Policy Institute have been laying their own groundwork for the future, 'making sure we do have the policies, personnel and process nailed down for every key agency when we do take the White House back,' Rollins said.

The nonprofit developed, she said, from efforts to avoid the chaotic early days of Trump's first term, when he arrived at the White House unprepared, with no clear plans ready to put in place.

As Trump was running for reelection, Rollins, then the head of Trump's Domestic Policy Council, began to sketch out a second-term agenda with fellow administration officials, including top economic policy adviser Larry Kudlow and national security adviser Robert O'Brien.

When it became clear Trump would be leaving the White House, she said, AFPI was created to continue that work 'organized around that second term agenda that we never released.'

The organization, once dismissed as a landing zone for ex-Trump administration officials shut out of more lucrative jobs, has grown into a behemoth, with an operating budget of around $25 million and 150 staff, including 17 former senior White Houses officials and nine former Cabinet members.

The group also has more than 20 policy centers and has tried to extend its reach beyond Washington with efforts to influence local legislatures and school boards.

Pictured: Police officers try to hold back the mob of Trump supporters on Jan. 6

An 'American leadership initiative,' led by the former head of the Office of Personnel Management, Michael Rigas, launched several weeks ago to identify future staff loyal to Trump and his 'America First' approach who could be hired as part of a larger effort to replace large swaths of the civil service, as Axios recently reported.

The group is one of several Trump-allied organizations that have continued to push his polices in his absence, including America First Legal, dedicated to fighting Biden's agenda through the court system, the Center for Renewing America and the Conservative Partnership Institute.

The summit is intended to highlight AFPI's 'America First Agenda,' centered around 10 key policy areas including the economy, health care and election security.

It includes many of Trump's signature issues, like continuing to build a wall along the southern border and a plan to 'dismantle the administrative state.'

In a speech Monday, former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, whose 'Contract with America' has been credited with helping Republicans sweep the 1994 midterm elections, praised the effort as key to future GOP victory.

https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/may/10/republicans-trump-election-big-lie,1,"Ron DeSantis was exultant. “The way Florida did it I think inspires confidence; I think that’s how elections should be run,” the state governor told reporters last November. “Rather than us be at the centre of a Bush v Gore in 2020, we’re now being looked at as the state that did it right.”

This boast of a smoothly run election just six months ago makes DeSantis’s actions this week all the more curious. The governor suddenly found it necessary to impose sweeping changes that limit mail-in voting and ballot drop boxes – and signed the new law live on the Fox News network on Thursday with no other media allowed.

It was perhaps the most brazen example yet of a renewed assault on American democracy crafted and led by former president Donald Trump and his Republican allies, electrified by “the big lie”, the false claim of a stolen election in 2020.

Far from losing influence over the party, critics say, Trump has in fact burrowed far into its DNA so that the two are now all but inseparable. And far from treating the 6 January insurrection at the US Capitol as a catharsis to break the spell, Republican-controlled state legislatures are using his false claim of election fraud to justify a sweep of anti-democratic measures across America.

On Friday the Texas house of representatives backed a bill to bar election officials from sending voters unsolicited mail-in ballot applications, while giving party-affiliated poll watchers greater access to voting sites. Restrictions on voting rights have also been signed into law in Georgia and Iowa with similar moves afoot in Ohio and Michigan. Activists warn that people of colour will be disproportionately prevented or discouraged from voting.

Sylvia Albert, voting and elections director for Common Cause, which campaigns for expanded voter access, told the Associated Press: “We are seeing the strong effect of President Trump’s big lie. We are seeing the Republican party go all-in on supporting him and his lies. We are seeing them use this opportunity to create deliberate barriers to voting for Black and brown voters. It’s un-American.”

Hopes that Trump would fade quietly into retirement and golf at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida were shattered last week. Having remained relatively marginal during Joe Biden’s first hundred days, which restored a calm of sorts to Washington, the former president launched a new web page and posted several tirades reviving his preposterous claim that he was the true winner of the 2020 election.

Notably he challenged Democrats and the media’s use of the label “the big lie” as shorthand for his bogus allegations of election fraud, stating: “They are right in that the 2020 Presidential Election was a Big Lie, but not in the way they mean.” His own definition, he said, is the stolen election itself, “the greatest Fraud in the history of our Country!”, even bigger than the Russia investigation and his two impeachments.

Trump’s characteristically judo-like move – flipping the weight of his opponents against them – was reminiscent of the way he appropriated the phrase “fake news”, once used to describe misinformation widespread on the web, and weaponised it to go after the media.

The 45th president also used his playbook to sow doubt and distrust by egging on his supporters’ legally meaningless investigations of an election that he lost by 7m votes six months ago. The Republican-controlled senate in Arizona, for example, has ordered a private recount of 2.1m ballots in Maricopa county, hiring a Florida-based contractor called Cyber Ninjas.

The justice department has expressed concern about ballot security and potential voter intimidation arising from the extraordinary audit. Katie Hobbs, Democratic secretary of state in Arizona, warned in a letter that parts of the recount “appear better suited for chasing conspiracy theories”, including one that thousands of fraudulent ballots were flown in from Asia using paper with bamboo fibres.

But the former commander-in-chief is deadly serious about it. Maggie Haberman, Washington correspondent for the New York Times, tweeted: “Trump is obsessed with the controversial Arizona audit and has told people he thinks it could undo the election.” In fact the audit cannot change the outcome of the election because the results were certified months ago in the state and Congress.

In another statement this week, Trump recycled his spurious claims of late-night vote “dumps” in Michigan and Wisconsin and demanded a review. Perhaps most bizarrely, he also saluted Windham, a town of 14,000 people in New Hampshire, where it transpired there had been an undercount of Republican votes in the election for the state legislature.

It would be easy for sceptics to dismiss 74-year-old Trump as a sore loser ranting into the void. But according to a CNN poll, 70% of Republicans believe that Biden did not win enough legitimate votes to be president. From the 30 state houses controlled by Republicans to the party leadership in Capitol Hill, Trump’s power and influence now appear absolute and fealty to the “big lie” is the ultimate test of devotion.

Senator Ted Cruz of Texas this week proudly tweeted a photo of himself dining with Trump at Mar-a-Lago, assuring fans: “He’s in great spirits!” Dissenters, by contrast, face hostility and political exile. Senator Mitt Romney, the sole Republican to vote to impeach Trump twice, was loudly booed and called a “traitor” at a Utah Republican party convention.

Liz Cheney, the party’s number three in the House of Representatives, is set to be ousted this week after urging colleagues to renounce the “cult of personality”. Senator Lindsey Graham countered that Republicans cannot “move forward” without Trump, telling Fox News: “I’ve always liked Liz Cheney, but she’s made a determination that the Republican party can’t grow with President Trump. I’ve determined we can’t grow without him.”

Cheney voted to impeach Trump after the US Capitol riot that left five people dead but her greatest offence appears to be denouncing “the big lie” for “poisoning our democratic system” and her call for true conservatives to abide by the rule of law. This is tantamount to heresy in the Republican party of 2021.

Kurt Bardella, a former spokesman and senior adviser on the House oversight committee, said: “What we’re seeing is the new really ideological core of the Republican party is fidelity to this lie that fuelled an insurrection attempt on January 6. It’s something that I think is even bigger than Trump at this point because it’s really rooted in truth versus lies and it says a lot that the only ‘transgression’ that Liz Cheney is guilty of is telling the truth about the results of a free and fair election.

“When that is cause to purge somebody from your leadership ranks, what that says about your party is that you are codifying your status as an anti-democratic force in America. The things that are happening here are so radical that if they were happening anywhere else in the world, we would call that a lurch towards extremism, a lurch towards the ingredients that result in terrorism.”

The imminent demise of Cheney suggests that Kevin McCarthy, the minority leader in the House, and other senior Republicans have concluded that throwing in their lot with Trump is key to winning next year’s midterm elections, which often depend on a party’s most committed supporters.

There was evidence for this in Texas last weekend when Susan Wright, the widow of the first member of Congress to die after contracting Covid-19, advanced to a House runoff for her late husband’s seat with Trump’s endorsement, whereas an avowed anti-Trump candidate crashed and burned.

Now, as his return to the spotlight gathers pace, the reality TV star turned politician is set to endorse more “America first” candidates committed to “election integrity” and return to campaign rallies. He is also said to be considering another run for the White House in 2024 – a further stress test of America’s perilously fragile democracy.

Tara Setmayer, a political analyst and former Republican communications director on Capitol Hill, said: “They learned no lessons whatsoever and it’s clear that the Republican party can no longer be considered a party that supports our American democracy. It’s no longer a party that values our constitutional institutions because everything that Donald Trump represents and what he continues to spew – implying that there was some massive fraudulent election that delegitimises Joe Biden – is so antithetical to everything that the Republican party claims to stand for.”",Trump’s grip over Republicans hardens as party cleaves to election ‘big lie’,1

Community centres, charities and local businesses were targeted last week in shameful scenes that have blighted towns and cities on UK streets in the wake of last week's Southport stabbing attack.

Almost 400 people have been arrested as vehicles were set alight and shops looted by balacalva-clad mobs with hotels being housed by migrants and asylum seekers also being targeted.

Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer today chaired an emergency Cobra meeting and vowed to set up a 'standing army' of specialist officers to tackle what he has condemned as 'far-right thuggery'.

Tommy Robinson, his ally 'Danny Tommo', Reclaim party leader Laurence Fox and figures from hate group Patriotic Alternative have been among those pouring fuel on the flames with inflammatory posts on X, Telegram, Facebook and TikTok.

Yet some of those who have taken to the streets don't know why they are there and are asking what they are even protesting about.

In one Facebook post advertising a protest in Weymouth and Portland, one person asks 'what in particular are we protesting' or 'is it everything in general' to which someone replies: 'It's everything in general.'

In Hull, a picture of two young women loaded with supposedly looted goods of fake Crocs were said to have been heard to be boasting with glee that 'it's like Christmas'.

The Lush store in the city was left with smashed front windows and products littered outside the front door.

The retailer said its staff were 'devastated at what has happened to our beautiful shop in Hull and how our fellow retailers have also been treated'.

A spokesperson said: 'We are proud to be part of a multi-racial Britain and to be part of the wonderful, vibrant and diverse community of Hull.

'Our wonderful shop manager and team have worked tirelessly to get the shop ready to start trading again.

'I want to thank those that came to help with the clean-up, from contractors repairing our windows and doors, the cleaning team that worked through the night, to the community of Hull who have shared their well-wishes to our team.'

Humberside Police arrested 29 people after the 'mindless thuggery' on Saturday.

Assistant Chief Constable Thom McLoughlin has vowed 'more will follow' as the force combs through videos and photos that have been sent in.

'I can assure you more will follow as we continue to extensively view numerous clips and videos that have been sent into us as well as circulating on social media to further assist with multiple lines of enquiry,' he said.

While a woman with a United Kingdom flag draped over her shoulders says during one protest as she grasps a mini flag in her hand: 'Put it another way. When you've got the Titanic and they filled it with too many people, what happened? It sunk.'

In the video she snarls: 'And that's what is happening to England. We're sinking. Too many here.'

The Titanic sank on April 14, 1912, during its maiden voyage across the Atlantic when it hit an iceberg at full speed. More than 1,500 men, women and children were killed.

Hundreds of far-right thugs have been arrested during six days of escalating disorder, which have seen attacks on police and buildings set alight.

Sir Keir vowed rioters would 'regret' engaging in 'far-right thuggery' and promised those involved in unrest would 'face the full force of the law' as he addressed the nation on Sunday.

After the Cobra meeting today, the premier said that 'there are a number of actions that came out of the meeting'.

'The first is we will have a standing army of specialist public duty officers so that we will have enough officers to deal with this where we need them,' he said.

'The second is we will ramp up criminal justice. There have already been hundreds of arrests, some have appeared in court this morning.

'I have asked for early consideration of the earliest naming and identification of those involved in the process who will feel the full force of the law.

'Thirdly, I have been absolutely clear that the criminal law applies online as well as offline. I am assured that that is the approach that is being taken.

'Whatever the apparent motivation, this is not protest, it is pure violence and we will not tolerate attacks on mosques or our Muslim communities.

'So the full force of the law will be visited on all those who are identified as having taken part in these activities.'

Sir Keir denied that 'two-tier policing' was being carried out in the UK.

He told broadcasters: 'There is no two-tier policing.

'There is policing without fear or favour – exactly as it should be, exactly what I would expect and require. So that is a non-issue.'

During the Cobra meeting, the PM 'paid tribute to the hard work of police officers over the past week and sent best wishes to those who have been injured protecting our streets', Downing Street said.

The talks were attended by Sir Keir, Deputy PM Angela Rayner, Home Secretary Yvette Cooper, Justice Secretary Shabana Mahmood, Technology Secretary Peter Kyle, Attorney General Richard Hermer, and Darren Jones, the Chief Secretary to the Treasury.

They met with senior police and prison service leaders, bosses from the National Crime Agency (NCA), and other top officials.

20 Jul 2023 21.00 BST Summary of the day Here’s a recap of today’s developments: Donald Trump faced a deadline of midnight on Thursday to say if he would appear before a Washington grand jury convened by the special counsel Jack Smith to consider federal charges over his election subversion and incitement of the attack on Congress on 6 January 2021.

Prosecutors had assembled evidence to charge Trump with three crimes, the Guardian reported late on Wednesday, citing two people familiar with the matter. They were: obstruction of an official proceeding, conspiracy to defraud the United States, and an unusual statute that makes it unlawful to conspire to violate civil rights.

A federal grand jury investigating Trump’s efforts to overturn the 2020 election has heard testimony from an aide who was with the former president for much of the day on 6 January 2021. William Russell was asked to appear on Thursday after making previous grand jury appearances. A data expert who worked on the 2020 election was also reportedly scheduled to appear before a grand jury.

House speaker Kevin McCarthy has denied he privately promised Trump that he would get legislation passed that would erase Trump’s two impeachments. According to a Politico report, in return for delaying an endorsement for Trump’s 2024 president election, McCarthy pledged that he would get the House to vote to expunge both impeachments against the former president. The outlet said McCarthy had promised to do so before Congress leaves for an August recess.

The Democratic-led Senate judiciary committee voted to advance a supreme court ethics reform bill that would tighten financial disclosures and bolster recusal requirements for justices. The vote was along party lines, with Republicans adamantly opposed. The panel vote came after months of scrutiny on the court over ethical controversies supreme court justices have been involved in.

Conservative non-profit groups steered by the rightwing legal activist, Leonard Leo, reportedly orchestrated a $1.8m public relations campaign to defend and celebrate supreme court justice, Clarence Thomas, after he faced renewed scrutiny over his past misconduct claims.

Democratic presidential candidate Robert F Kennedy Jr defended himself against accusations of racism and antisemitism at a hearing on alleged “weaponization” of the federal government. Kennedy provoked anger last week when he was filmed falsely suggesting that the coronavirus could have been “ethnically targeted” to spare Ashkenazi Jews and Chinese people. A report seen by the Guardian said Kennedy has a long history of racism, antisemitism and xenophobia. Share Updated at 21.02 BST

20 Jul 2023 20.53 BST Florida Governor Ron DeSantis backed Senator Tommy Tuberville’s months-long blockade on military nominations over the Pentagon’s abortion policy, saying that the policy would “go out the window” if he became president. Asked by radio host Hugh Hewitt if he thinks Tuberville should release his hold, DeSantis replied: “No I don’t.” He added: The military’s policy is not following US law. They are using tax dollars. They’re funding abortion tourism, which is not an appropriate thing for the military to be doing. He said: Day one as commander-in-chief, that policy will go out the window. Tuberville, the Republican senator for Alabama, mounted his obstruction effort earlier this year. He is seeking the end of Department of Defense policy that provides paid time off and covers travel costs for servicewomen and dependents in need of abortion services. Tuberville’s blockade has so far impacted nearly 300 military promotions, according to the Hill. The Pentagon has said more than 650 leadership positions could be vacant by the end of the year. Joe Biden and the US defense secretary, Lloyd Austin, said last week that the senator’s hold is jeopardising US national security. Share

20 Jul 2023 20.38 BST Maya Yang Texas women who were denied abortions took the stand and delivered harrowing testimonies of their experiences of carrying life-threatening pregnancies as a result of the state’s highly restrictive abortion laws. The women are part of a lawsuit filed in March by the Center for Reproductive Rights, which is seeking clarification on which situations fall under the “medical emergency” exception in Texas’s abortion bans. The lawsuit appears to be the first of its kind where women who were denied abortions are suing a state since the supreme court overturned Roe v Wade last year. During Wednesday’s hearing, plaintiff Samantha Casiano delivered an emotional testimony about being forced to give birth to a baby who died four hours later as a result of a fatal birth defect. Twenty weeks into her pregnancy, Casiano discovered that her baby had anencephaly, a rare condition in which parts of the baby’s skull and brain are missing. Casiano said that doctors informed her that they were unable to perform an abortion in the state and that she was instead given funeral home information. “I felt like I was abandoned,” Casiano said. I had this funeral home paper and this is just supposed to be a scan day. Casiano went on to describe her thought processes upon learning about her baby’s defect, telling the court that she considered getting an abortion out of state but was also afraid of losing her job or being jailed. She said: I felt like I was imprisoned in my own body. At one point, as Casiano read aloud a doctor’s note about her high-risk pregnancy, she became overwhelmed and vomited during the hearing. Following a recess, Casiano returned to the stand and said that recalling the events “just makes my body remember, and it just reacts”. She added: I now have a psychiatrist … I now vomit a lot more. I’ve never vomited before like that, ever, before my pregnancy. My body’s never reacted that way. Read the full story here.

20 Jul 2023 19.35 BST Donald Trump’s court dates are set to clash with the Republican primary calendar. The former president faces three civil trials in New York, one to begin in October and two in January. The clash is raising extraordinary and unprecedented questions about the logistical, legal and political challenges of various trials unfolding against the backdrop of a presidential campaign, according to the New York Times. The paper cites Bruce Green, a Fordham University professor and former prosecutor, as saying: The courts will have to decide how to balance the public interest in having expeditious trials against Trump’s interest and the public interest in his being able to campaign so that the democratic process works. That’s a type of complexity that courts have never had to deal with before. Share

20 Jul 2023 19.22 BST Martin Pengelly In polling averages for the Republican primary, Donald Trump leads by about 30 points. He has maintained that lead even while facing 34 criminal charges in New York, over hush-money payments to the porn star Stormy Daniels; 37 federal charges over his retention of classified documents; the prospect of state and federal indictments over his election subversion; a $5m fine after being held liable for sexual abuse and defamation against the writer E Jean Carroll; and ongoing investigations of his business affairs. Denying all wrongdoing, Trump has pleaded not guilty to all criminal charges. Nonetheless, polling regarding a notional general election shows him in a close race with Joe Biden. Earlier this week, Miles Taylor, who was a US homeland security official when in 2018 he wrote a famous anonymous New York Times column warning of Trump’s unfitness for office, told the Guardian Trump could yet return to the White House. “There’s been a number of polls that show the ex-president beating Joe Biden by several points,” Taylor said. It would be hubris to say, ‘Oh, no, we would beat him again a second time.’ Actually, I don’t think that. If the election was held today, I think Donald Trump would defeat Joe Biden, and that really concerns me. Taylor also pointed to the supine nature of the Republican party, saying McCarthy, the House speaker, “thought Trump was a buffoon and a danger and I’m sure Kevin still thinks that privately” but is unwilling, or unable, to move in any way against him. Taylor said: Those people publicly, because they’re afraid, are still supporting the man. That collective anonymity is putting us in pretty seriously great danger. Share

Ms Etchingham, while presenting the 10pm newscast on Friday, seemingly took aim at Thomas Birley, a thug who stole a police baton and helped set fire to the Holiday Inn Express in Rotherham, which was filled with asylum seekers, on August 4.

'The longest prison sentence yet for someone involved in last month's riots has been handed down to a former painter and decorator. The only walls he'll be staring at for the next nine years will be those of a prison cell,' she said, apparently reading from a tele-prompter.

It is unclear if Ms Etchingham wrote the news script or merely just read a snarky jab penned by the show's producers. MailOnline has approached ITV for comment.

Birley, 27, was sentenced on Friday to nine years in prison, with five years on licence as part of a 14-year extended sentence. He previously pleaded guilty to arson with intent to endanger life, violent disorder and possessing an offensive weapon.

Birley stole a police baton and stoked a fire in a bin by an entranceway to the Holiday Inn Express on August 4. It came amid a wave of riots across the country after the fatal stabbing of three young girls in a knife attack in Southport on July 29.

The actions of Birley - who previously posted on social media 'I can't be racist because my wife has two black eyes' - and his fellow rioters caused those inside the hotel to fear for their lives, and staff were so afraid they barricaded themselves inside a panic room, the court heard.

The self-described 'God's gift to decorating' has previous convictions including criminal damage, attacking emergency workers and racially aggravated harassment.

Birley was sentenced to nine years in prison at Sheffield Crown Court by Judge Jeremy Richardson, who said his actions were 'suffused with racism from beginning to end'.

Judge Richardson said his case was 'unquestionably' one of the most serious of the dozens he has dealt with in the past month in relation to the rioting outside the Holiday Inn.

Sheffield Crown Court heard how the painter and decorator of Swinton, Rotherham, was involved in many of the worst incidents, including adding wood to the fire in the large industrial bin which had been pushed against an exit and helping place a further bin on top of the one ablaze.

Birley was also filmed throwing missiles at the police, squaring up to officers while brandishing a police baton and throwing a large bin which crashed into a line of officers with riot shields.

The defendant became the first person to be sentenced for arson with intent to endanger life following the 12 hours of violence in Manvers which left 64 police officers, three horses and a dog injured.

Judge Richardson heard how 22 staff in the hotel barricaded themselves into its panic room with freezers and 'thought they were going to burn to death'.

Addressing Bailey, the judge continued: 'I have now watched much recorded CCTV and recorded footage of events.

'It is clear as clear could be, you and many like you were intent on spreading a hateful message of violence and racism.

'You were well to the fore in all of this. The disorder was grotesque.'

Body worn video from officers showed Birley throw a bin and rocks at officers before deliberately blocking an entrance to the hotel, which was previously set alight, with a sheet of wood and a large bin.

Judge Richardson said all those in the hotel were 'in peril of being killed or seriously injured' and told Bailey: 'You intended to endanger the lives of them all.'

He also said Birley had been encouraged to join the disorder 'by malicious and ignorant posts' on social media.

'You were a leading participant in ignorant, racist attempts at mob rule,' the judge said.

He said he needed to pass a lengthy sentence due to Birley's ongoing dangerousness, which included an extended five-year licence period.

A pre-sentence report showed Birley held views which 'raised alarm' with a probation officer, the judge said, including hints of a 'white supremacist mindset'.

Birley's social media shows a litany of sexist and racist posts in which he used racial slurs and joked about being in prison.

In December, he wrote on Facebook: 'I can't be racist - my wife has two black eyes.'

And before sentencing last night, he posted an Oasis quote: 'Don't look back in anger.'

Older posts from his previous appearances at court show he called police officers 'piggy b******s' and told them to 'f*** off'.

Birley has been sentenced to an extended sentence of 14 years, with nine years in prison for arson with intent to endanger life, two years and eight months for violent disorder and 12 months for possession of an offensive weapon. He will serve a five-year extended licence period.

The hotel was targeted by Birley and around 400 others during days of rioting involving violence, arson and looting as well as racist attacks, which followed the killings of three young girls in the northern town of Southport on July 29.

There were more than 200 asylum seekers in the building and the judge heard how automated fire alarms told them to leave but they were trapped inside.

The Southport attack was initially blamed on an Islamist migrant, false claims based on online misinformation. An 18-year-old, Axel Rudakubana, who was born in Cardiff and has Christian parents, has been charged with three counts of murder as well multiple charges of attempted murder.

A protest in Southport the day after the killings turned violent and riots spread across the country in unrest not seen in Britain since 2011, when the fatal shooting of a black man by police triggered several days of street violence.

Police and prosecutors have responded rapidly, with roughly 1,300 people having been arrested and around 200 jailed – one for as long as six years for violent disorder.

Others have been charged for inciting racial or religious hatred online.

Elsewhere on Friday, four teenagers were sentenced at Truro Crown Court for disorder that erupted in Plymouth in the days after the attack.

Judge Richardson said Birley's case was 'unquestionably' one of the most serious of the dozens he has dealt with in the past month in relation to the rioting outside the Holiday Inn (Birley not pictured)

So far, a total of 26 people have been charged in connection with the unrest which gripped the city on the evening of Monday 5 August.

Yesterday, Thursday 5 September, a 16-year-old girl and three 17-year-old boys, appeared at Truro Crown Court after having been convicted of violent disorder. All four, who cannot be named for legal reasons, were given referral orders which impose strict conditions on each individual. They were also ordered to pay court costs.

Chief Inspector Tom Cunningham said: 'We continue to pursue those who were involved in the violent disorder that night and hold them to account.

'Last month, the city saw dozens of people intent on violence which has had an understandable effect on our community and continues to cause concern, particularly among our diverse communities.

'Our neighbourhood officers, including those within the Devon & Cornwall Police Diverse Community Team, have been working closely with groups to ensure that anyone who has concerns knows where to seek support and anyone who has been a victim of hate crime has the confidence to come forward.

'There are many ways to report incidents, including third party reporting; by visiting a local hate crime reporting centre where a specialist or representative from your protected characteristic community can help you through the reporting process and offer support. The below link outlines where you can find these centres.

'There are also many charities, groups, and organisations which can offer support, advice, and ways to report the incident without having to talk directly to the police.'

A man was also jailed for more than two years for his role in violent disorder in Southport on 30 July.

Connor Ashley Piggott, 25 years, of Landsdown Road, Chester appeared at Liverpool Crown Court on Thursday 5 September, after pleading guilty to violent disorder.

He was sentenced to two years, four months in prison.

Birley wore a face covering that appeared to be made out of a plastic bag but kept removing it to shout at police officers

Bodycam footage showed the moment Birley identified himself to police officers before being placed under arrest

Detective Chief Inspector Tony Roberts said: 'The despicable actions of those involved that day left more than 50 officers injured and Piggott was seen on video repeatedly throwing bricks toward police officers.

'Like many others, he wore a balaclava in a bid to hide his identity. But thanks to officers who trawled many hours of CCTV and social media footage, his efforts were in vain.

'Piggott was positively identified as one of those launching objects towards officers who had been dispatched to the area to protect the public.

'He will now spend a significant amount of time in prison and I hope he spends that time reflecting on his actions that day.

'To date, we have arrested 96, charged 60 and sentenced 43 people, and there will be many more to come.

'We continue to identify more people who attended the disorder in Merseyside and we will not stop until we've put everyone we possibly can before the courts.'",ITV News' Julie Etchingham issues savage dig at migrant hotel arsonist given heaviest sentence yet over UK riots,1
https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8825687/UK-temporarily-recalls-ambassador-Belarus.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490,1,"Britain has temporarily recalled its Ambassador to Belarus after Alexander Lukashenko expelled 35 diplomats from neighbouring Poland and Lithuania.

Minsk asked the two NATO countries, both vocal critics of the Belarusian regime, to scale back the number of diplomatic staff they had in Belarus on Friday amid political unrest following President Lukashenko's contested reelection.

Authorities in Minsk have cracked down on protests disputing the results of the election for more than two months, with demands made for Lukashenko's resignation and freedom for political prisoners.

The opposition says he must quit but Lukashenko has accused them of being Western 'puppets' intent on overthrowing his government. He has received backing from Russian President Vladimir Putin.

Lukashenko, dubbed Europe's last dictator, has also accused NATO countries of a military build-up on his border.

Last, Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab announced that Britain's Ambassador to Belarus, Jacqueline Perkins, is being temporarily recalled in solidarity with Poland and Lithuania.

Seven other European countries, including Germany, Romania and the Czech Republic, have also withdrawn their Ambassadors.

Jacqueline Perkins: A closer look at Britain's Ambassador to Minsk Jacqueline Perkins arrived in Minsk in August 2019 to take up her appointment as Britain's Ambassador to the Republic of Belarus. Prior to this she was Deputy Ambassador at the British Embassy in Kuwait. Jacqueline joined the FCDO in 1989. She has had overseas postings to Abu Dhabi, Cairo and Bahrain, as well as spending a year in Egypt on Arabic language training. At the FCDO in London she has worked on Germany, the EU and the Middle East. Jacqueline studied Modern Languages (German and Russian) at the University of Cambridge and has an MA in International Relations from the University of Notre Dame in the USA. She comes from Cornwall, is married and has a son and a daughter, both of whom are at university in the UK. Advertisement

The diplomatic stand-off marks a further deterioration in relations between European capitals and Minsk.

Last week, the EU followed Britain and Canada in imposing sanctions on senior figures in Belarus who they say are responsible for human rights abuses against opposition campaigners.

Mr Raab said in the wake of the election that the UK did not accept the result as he hit out at the 'violence used by the Belarusian authorities to suppress' demonstrations that followed the vote.

Last night, Mr Raab tweeted: '(The UK) condemns Belarus' decision to expel Polish & Lithuanian diplomats. Completely unjustified and will only isolate the Belarusian people.

'In solidarity, we are temporarily recalling our Ambassador for consultations on the situation in Belarus.'

Mr Lukashenko, who has been the sole occupant of the position since it was established 26 years ago, won with 80 per cent of the vote while his main challenger Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya received only 10 per cent.

She and her supporters refused to recognise the result as valid, and mass protests have rocked Belarus ever since.

Tikhanovskaya was forced to go into exile in Lithuania after receiving threats following the disputed vote.

Belarus says Lithuania and Poland are interfering in its internal affairs by hosting Tikhanovskaya and other opposition figures and refusing to accept the election result.

It asked both countries to scale back the number of staff at their embassies amid tensions over the crackdown.

Both countries had initially refused to comply with the demand to cut staffing but then recalled their Ambassadors in Belarus for consultations in the hope of reducing tensions.

Deputy Foreign Minister Marcin Przydacz told Reuters: 'The Belarusian authorities requested us to limit the number of our diplomatic personnel in Belarus. That means that more than 30 diplomats are leaving Belarus right now and coming back to Warsaw.'

Lithuanian Foreign Ministry spokesman Rasa Jakilaitiene said the country had recalled five diplomats 'in hope that the step is sufficient to keep the possibility of a dialogue'.

The Belarusian Government has detained more than 10,000 people since the protests began, according to the Viasna human rights centre.

This week, Belarus police detained 317 people and deployed water cannon during mass protests against Lukashenko.

Many opposition activists have been beaten up by police and thousands have been arrested during months of unrest.

https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-9569675/Israel-heading-scale-WAR-warns.html,1,"Benjamin Netanyahu has threatened to 'inflict blows that Hamas has not dreamed of' prompting Hamas to retaliate with 130 rockets of its own, as the deadly fighting in the middle east continued on Wednesday.

Israeli strikes killed several of the Islamist group's top commanders on Wednesday, and destroyed another multi-storey building in Gaza City, as the U.N. warned of a 'full scale war' in the region.

Israeli fighter jets dropped two bombs on the 14-storey Al-Sharouk tower, which housed the bureau of the Al-Aqsa television channel, and is the third tall structure in Gaza City levelled since the bombing campaign began Monday.

The Israeli Prime Minister issued the threat as he visited a hospital in the city of Holon today, paying tribute to those wounded in fighting between the two sides that is now at its worst point since the 2014 Gaza War.

Referencing the deaths of Hamas commanders earlier in the day - including Brigadier General Bassem Issa and Jamal Zabda, head of the group's rocket unit - Netanyahu vowed: 'This is only the beginning.'

His comments came despite international calls for urgent deescalation and as Israel braces for more missile strikes overnight to avenge the deaths of its commanders.

In just two days of fighting, Hamas has fired more than 1,000 rockets at Israel, while the Jewish state has carried out counter-strikes against what it called military targets.

But the civilian death toll is quickly mounting, with at least with at least 65 Palestinians including 14 children and three women killed as of Wednesday evening, alongside seven Israelis including one child and one soldier.

Calls for deescalation of the conflict have come from senior politicians around the world, including the United Kingdom, the United States and Russia.

America's President Biden 'will nominated a qualified, experienced ambassador to Israel over the coming weeks,' White House press secretary Jen Psaki said on Wednesday. 'Our objective here is deescalation as we look to protecting people in the region.'

Biden's British counterpart Boris Johnson Boris condemned the spiralling conflict, saying he was 'urging Israel and the Palestinians to step back from the brink and for both sides to show restraint' on Wednesday morning.

Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov called for an urgent meeting of the Middle East Quartet in order to halt violence between Israel and the Palestinians.

Another multi-storey building was destroyed in Gaza on Wednesday evening by an Israeli air strike, prompting Hamas to retaliate with 130 rockets of its own, as the deadly fighting in the middle east continued on Wednesday.

Ms Psaki said that the Biden administration has 'had more than 25, high level calls and meetings by senior US officials with senior officials from Israel, the Palestinian Authority, and their partners and other stakeholders.

'A lot of it is happening, privately through diplomatic channels, it's happening with officials in the region we're in regular dialogue, multiple times per day as I noted with the Egyptian and Qatari officials, who have significant influence over Hamas - and our objective here is descalation as we look to protecting the people to reach out.'

Meanwhile, U.S. Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken has called Netanyahu to reaffirm America's support for Israel's right to defend itself from Hamas rocket attacks.

The country's State Department said he also repeated U.S. calls for a de-escalation of violence and the Biden administration's belief that both Israelis and Palestinians have the right to live in safety and security.

Blinken announced earlier he was sending a senior diplomat to the region to make similar appeals in person to Israeli and Palestinian officials. He also said that Israel had an 'extra burden' to avoid civilian casualties as it responds to the attacks.

According to the State Department, Blinken also told Netanyahu that as he and President Joe Biden have said in the past, the administration believes Israelis and Palestinians should 'enjoy equal measures of freedom, security, prosperity, and democracy.'

He also 'emphasised the need for Israelis and Palestinians to be able to live in safety and security, as well as enjoy equal measures of freedom, security, prosperity, and democracy,' in an apparent effort for the Biden administration to demonstrate that it cares about Palestinian rights, according to Politico.

Also on Wednesday, speaking alongside United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, Russia's Lavrov said: 'Today we've come to the common opinion that the most pressing task is to convene the Quartet of international mediators - Russia, the United States, the UN and the EU.'

Israeli police announced Wednesday that they are imposing a nighttime curfew on the central city of Lod, that was the scene of unrest in recent days

Police said in a statement that officers would enforce the ban on people entering Lod, residents leaving their homes, and people in public spaces starting at 8 p.m.

Lod has seen two nights of violent protests, including the torching of dozens of vehicles, a synagogue, and violent clashes between Arab protesters and police. Israeli authorities declared a state of emergency in the city and deployed Border Police forces.

Hamas has confirmed that Bassem Issa, commander of its Gaza City Brigade, was among those 'martyred' today.

Shin Bet, Israel's internal security agency, named another three slain Hamas officers: Jamaa Tahla, responsible for the improved accuracy of the group's rockets; Jamal Zabeda, chief of 'special projects' in the munitions department; and Hazzem Hatib, head engineer in the munitions wing.

The militants have launched more than 1,050 rockets at Israel since Monday, killing six civilians, including an Arab-Israeli girl in the city of Lod in the early hours of this morning.

'The army will continue to attack to bring a total, long-term quiet. Only when we reach that goal will we be able to speak about a truce,' Defence Minister Benny Gantz said today from the southern town of Ashkelon where two Israeli women were killed by Hamas rockets on Tuesday.

Along the Gaza border, an Israeli soldier was killed by an anti-tank missile, the military said.

As clashes continued on Israel's streets on Wednesday, one of Israel's two chief rabbis appealed for restraint as media reported a spread of street attacks by Jews on members of the country's Arab minority, some of whom have mounted violent protests in solidarity with Gaza Palestinians.

'We must not be dragged into provocations and inflicting harm on people or property,' Sephardi Chief Rabbi Yitzhak Yosef said in a statement. 'The Torah of Israel grants no license for taking the law into one's hands and acting violently.'

But after his comments, a large crowd of ultranationalist Israelis attacked a car in a Tel Aviv suburb they suspected was driven by an Arab, dragging the driver out of the car and beating him.

A video from the scene on Wednesday shows the driver trying to maneuver the vehicle to flee the scene but colliding into two other vehicles. He is then pulled from the vehicle and beaten. TV footage from the scene showed the driver motionless on the ground.

A doctor at Tel Aviv's Ichilov hospital said the driver was hospitalized with serious injuries. Dr. Eyal Hashiva told reporters he suffered major trauma to his entire body but was in stable condition.

Hamas militants and their allies have fired more than 1,000 missiles at Israel, though many have been shot down by the Iron Dome defence system, while others have landed inside Gaza. The Israeli towns of Ashdod, Ashkelon and Yehud have been struck, as well as the most populous city, Tel Aviv. In the Gaza Strip, the Israeli Air Force has targeted suspected Hamas strongholds in Gaza City as well as the southern settlements Rafah and Khan Yunis

The United Nations has warned the two sides they risk a 'full-scale war' if there is not an urgent ceasefire.

'Stop the fire immediately. We're escalating towards a full-scale war. Leaders on all sides have to take the responsibility of de-escalation,' Tor Wennesland UN Special Envoy to the Middle East tweeted.

Just after daybreak, the Israeli Air Force unleashed dozens of strikes within the course of a few minutes with what appeared to be bunker buster bombs targeting underground Hamas infrastructure.

The Israeli Defence Forces later dispatched two infantry brigades to the area of a downed militant drone, indicating preparations for a possible ground invasion.

Boris Johnson condemned the spiralling conflict this morning hours after his former counterpart Donald Trump blamed 'weak' Joe Biden for allowing things to escalate.

'I am urging Israel and the Palestinians to step back from the brink and for both sides to show restraint,' the Prime Minister said. 'The UK is deeply concerned by the growing violence and civilian casualties.'

Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab spoke to the Israeli foreign minister on Tuesday and will speak to the Palestinian prime minister on Wednesday, MPs were told in Westminster.

Despite international condemnation for the bloodshed, the worst since the 2014 war, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has rejected calls for ceasefire, vowing last night to 'step up' attacks.

Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh said in turn that 'if Israel wants to escalate, we are ready for it'.

The tensions began a month ago in Jerusalem, where heavy-handed police tactics during Ramadan and the threatened eviction of dozens of Muslim neighbourhoods ignited protests and clashes with police. On Monday, a riot on Temple Mount left hundreds of Palestinians wounded before Hamas started launching rockets.

The International Criminal Court at the Hague announced this morning it was looking at possible 'crimes' committed as the ferocious cross-border engagement entered its third day.

'I note with great concern the escalation of violence in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, as well as in and around Gaza, and the possible commission of crimes under the Rome Statute (which founded the ICC)', Fatou Bensouda tweeted.

More than a hundred Hamas rockets were launched at Israel's most populous city, Tel Aviv, last night after a tower block in Gaza suspected of being a Hamas headquarters was destroyed by an Israeli air strike.

Israel is not a member of the court and has rejected the probe.

Israelis sing to keep their spirits up in a Tel Aviv bomb shelter Footage has emerged of Israelis singing in a bomb shelter as fighting between the Jewish state and Hamas intensified today amid warnings of all-out war. The video was taken in Tel Aviv overnight as the city was targeted by a barrage of rockets fired from Gaza. It shows a large group of people standing in what appears to be a basement car park being led in song by Shuli Rand, a well-known Jewish actor and musician. The song is called Between Holiness and Secularity, and the lyrics that appear in the video translate as: 'Please save me and please keep me from harm.' Footage has emerged of Israelis in a bomb shelter in Tel Aviv overnight singing as the city was targeted by 201 Hamas rockets Tel Aviv found itself targeted overnight by rockets as Hamas said 210 rockets had been fired at the city, which is Israel's most-populous. The strike was in retaliation for a multi-storey block of apartments that was blown up in Gaza, Hamas said. At least 65 people have been killed in Gaza since violence escalated on Monday, according to the enclave's health ministry. Six people have been killed in Israel, medical officials said.

The IDF have assassinated several top militant commanders, including Hassan Kaogi, head of the Hamas intelligence department, in their airstrikes.

In a statement, the army said it carried out a 'complex and first-of-its-kind operation.' Those targeted, it said, were 'a key part of the Hamas 'General Staff'' and considered close to the head of the group's military wing.

Hamas later confirmed they had lost several of their top brass, including its military chief in Gaza City, Bassem Issa.

The Israelis accuse the Palestinian fighters of using their own people as human shields, but the civilian casualties in the Gaza Strip have only hardened the position of the extremists who have launched hundreds more missiles.

In Israel's central city of Lod, a girl and her father were killed in the early hours of Wednesday by rocket fire from Gaza. Israel's foreign ministry identified the girl as 16-year-old Nadin Awad, an Arab Israeli.

Her cousin, Ahmad Ismail, told public broadcaster Kan that he was near Nadin when she was killed alongside her father Khalil Awad, 52.

'I was at home, we heard the noise of the rocket. It happened so quickly. Even if we had wanted to run somewhere, we don't have a safe room,' Ismail told Kan.

Lod also saw riots after thousands of mourners joined a funeral for an Arab man killed by a suspected Jewish gunman the previous night.

The crowd fought with police, and set a synagogue and some 30 vehicles, including a police car, on fire, Israeli media reported.

Paramedics said a 56-year-old man was seriously hurt after his car was pelted with stones.

The Israeli President Reuven Rivlin described it as a 'pogrom' carried out by a 'bloodthirsty Arab mob,' after Netanyahu declared a state of emergency in the mixed Jewish-Arab city.

'The sight of the pogrom in Lod and the disturbances across the country by an incited and bloodthirsty Arab mob, injuring people, damaging property and even attacking sacred Jewish spaces is unforgivable,' Rivlin said.

Yair Revivo, mayor of the city, last night called for army back-up to help secure the area, saying 'civil war' was breaking out.

'This is Kristallnacht in Lod,' said Revivo, in reference to the Nazi pogrom against German Jews in 1938.

'I have called on the prime minister to declare a state of emergency in Lod. To call in the IDF. To impose a curfew. To restore quiet. There is a failure of governance.

'This is a giant incident - an Intifada of Arab Israelis. All the work we have done here for years [on coexistence] has gone down the drain.'

Netanhayu made a pre-dawn tour of the city to declare a state of emergency.

'We will not tolerate this; we need to restore calm,' Netanyahu said in Lod. 'If this isn't an emergency situation, I don't know what is. We are talking about life and death here.'

TRUMP: 'WEAK' BIDEN TO BLAME FOR CONFLICT Former US President Donald Trump blamed his successor Joe Biden's 'weakness' for the renewed clashes in the Middle East. Writing on his website Trump, he said: 'When I was in office we were known as the Peace Presidency, because Israel's adversaries knew that the United States stood strongly with Israel and there would be swift retribution if Israel was attacked. 'Under Biden, the world is getting more violent and more unstable because Biden's weakness and lack of support for Israel is leading to new attacks on our allies. 'America must always stand with Israel and make clear that the Palestinians must end the violence, terror, and rocket attacks, and make clear that the U.S. will always strongly support Israel's right to defend itself. 'Unbelievably, Democrats also continue to stand by crazed anti-American Rep. Ilhan Omar, and others, who savagely attack Israel while they are under terrorist assault.' Advertisement

Asked whether the actions of the police against protesters may have played a role, he shut down the suggestion, saying: 'These events have no excuse; this is fundamental hate.'

It comes after the PM, speaking after two women were killed in Hamas strikes yesterday, said he 'deplored' the deaths in Israel, adding that the country's military would 'further increase both the intensity and the rate' of its own air strikes against Gaza.

'Hamas will be hit in ways that it does not expect,' Netanyahu said. 'We have eliminated commanders, hit many important targets and we have decided to attack harder and increase the pace of attacks.'

The homes of three Hamas commanders were destroyed overnight on Wednesday.

A significant barrage had begun by 3am, with Israel firing into the Gaza Strip.

'In response to HUNDREDS of rockets in the last 24 hours, the IDF has struck a number of significant terror targets and terror operatives across the Gaza Strip, marking our largest strike since 2014,' the IDF confirmed.

'We are currently striking more terror targets in Gaza.'

In Israel, five people including three women have been killed.

One of the three women was in her 60s and another in her 80s, and died during Hamas rocket attacks earlier on Tuesday.

The third woman, aged 50, was killed on Tuesday evening when a rocket hit a building in the Tel Aviv suburb of Rishon Lezion.

The renewed confrontation, following weeks of tensions and clashes in the contested Jerusalem, was sparked on Monday evening when Hamas fired a barrage of missiles towards Jerusalem.

It continued into the early hours of Wednesday morning, with more rockets being fired by the Islamist group into Tel Aviv, and by Israel into Gaza.

On Tuesday afternoon, Trump posted to his website, saying that America 'will always strongly support Israel's right to defend itself' as he criticised Biden over the growing crisis.

Earlier, the White House had said Biden was being briefed on the escalating situation.

Israel's Iron Dome defence system continued to struggle with the volume of rockets being fired from Gaza on Tuesday evening, after an Israeli air strike caused a 13-storey residential building to collapse in Gaza City.

Residents of the collapsed residential block and the surrounding area had been warned to evacuate the area around an hour before the air strike, according to witnesses, and there were no reports of casualties two hours after it collapsed.

Shortly after the attack, Hamas - the Islamist group that rules inside Gaza - and the Islamic Jihad group said they would respond by firing rockets at Tel Aviv, which they did by firing 210 rockets towards Beersheba and Tel Aviv in response to the bombing of the tower buildings in Gaza City.

Air raid sirens and explosions were heard around the city, and the skies were lit up by the streaks of multiple interceptor missiles launched towards the incoming rockets.

Pedestrians ran for shelter, and diners streamed out of Tel Aviv restaurants while others flattened themselves on pavements as the sirens sounded.

The Israel Airports Authority said it had halted take-offs at Tel Aviv airport 'to allow defence of the nation's skies'.

Video broadcast on Israeli Channel 12 television showed interceptor missiles rising above the runways.

'We are now carrying out our promise,' Hamas's armed wing said.

'The Qassam Brigades are launching their biggest rocket strike against Tel Aviv and its suburbs, with 130 rockets, in response to the enemy's targeting of residential towers.'

The sound of the outgoing rockets could be heard in Gaza. As the rockets rose into the skies, mosques across Gaza blared with chants of 'God is great,' 'victory to Islam' and 'resistance.'

One rocket struck a bus in the central city of Holon, just south of Tel Aviv. Medics said three people, including a five-year-old girl, were wounded and the bus went up in flames.

Israel said it had sent 80 jets to bomb Gaza, and dispatched infantry and armour to reinforce the tanks already gathered on the border, evoking memories of the last ground incursion into Gaza to stop rocket attacks, in 2014.

More than 2,100 Gazans were killed in the seven-week war that followed, according to the Gaza health ministry, along with 73 Israelis, and thousands of homes in Gaza were razed.

The U.N. Security will hold emergency consultations Wednesday on the escalating violence between Palestinians and Israelis.

The U.N. Mideast envoy, Tor Wennesland, is expected to brief the 15 council members virtually at the closed meeting, which is being called at the request of China, Tunisia and Norway.

China holds the council presidency this month and its U.N. mission confirms plans for the second emergency meeting in three days. It is an indication of growing international concern about the conflict and where it might lead.

The U.N.'s most powerful body has not yet taken any action.

China, Tunisia and Norway proposed a draft statement at Monday's meeting expressing 'grave concern' at escalating tensions and calling on Israel to cease evictions.

Egypt was been trying to broker a cease-fire into Tuesday, but the cycle of violence was gaining momentum.

Even before the Israeli deaths, the Israeli military said it was sending troop reinforcements to the Gaza border and the defence minister Benny Gantz ordered the mobilisation of 5,000 reserve soldiers.

But contrary to Egypt's efforts, Iran's Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei urged Palestinians to 'build up power' on state television, saying 'Zionists (Israel) only understand the language of force'.

Iran and Israel consider one-another arch enemies, with Iran refusing to recognise the existence of Israel as a state since the 1979 Iranian Revolution.

Iranian state TV on Tuesday quoted Khamenei as saying that it was a duty of every state to take a stand and condemn this 'evil, criminal, brutal and cruel' action by Israel.

Khamenei also said Palestinian need to be empowered in order to 'force' Israel to accept their rights.

'They should make themselves powerful, resist and confront so as to force the other party to withdraw from crime and surrender to what's right and fair,' Khamenei said.

Iran backs anti-Israel militant groups across the region, including Hamas and Islamic Jihad in the Gaza Strip.

In the U.S., the White House said on Tuesday that Biden was being briefed daily on developments in Jerusalem and Gaza, and has directed his team to engage intensively with senior Israeli and Palestinian officials as well as leaders throughout the Middle East.

Press secretary Jen Psaki said on Tuesday that Biden's team is communicating a clear and consistent message in support of de escalation.

'That is our primary focus,' she said, adding that Biden supports Israel's 'legitimate right to defend itself and its people' and at the same time condemns ongoing 'rocket attacks by Hamas and other terrorist groups including against Jerusalem.'

She added that the Biden administration 'will also continue to support a two state solution to the Israeli Palestinian conflict.'

But on his own website, Trump posted a message saying that 'America must always stand with Israel and make clear that the Palestinians must end the violence, terror, and rocket attacks, and make clear that the U.S. will always strongly support Israel's right to defend itself.'

Trump criticised Biden, saying: 'Because Israel's adversaries knew that the United States stood strongly with Israel and there would be swift retribution if Israel was attacked.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu tours Lod early on Wednesday. He declared a state of emergency in the central city as police accused Arab residents of waging 'wide-scale riots'

'Under Biden, the world is getting more violent and more unstable because Biden's weakness and lack of support for Israel is leading to new attacks on our allies.'

Tuesday also saw a pipeline belonging to an Israeli state-owned energy company hit in a rocket attack from Gaza, an Israeli government official and an energy sector official told Reuters.

Video broadcast by Channel 12 showed flames rising from what appeared to be a large fuel vat near the Israeli Mediterranean city of Ashkelon, south of Tel Aviv.

Operations at a power plant in Ashkelon were not interrupted, Channel 13 TV said.

In Israel, residents of Ashkelon have been running to shelters as air raid sirens wail.

'At around 5am, we were woken by sirens. We had to hide in the wardrobe because there is no shelter in the house,' said Shelly Belayev, whose building was heavily damaged, its facade blackened and an apartment devastated.

'There was a very strong explosion, I have never heard a sound like it. I quickly realised the missile fell here,' she said.

'I went outside, I was in shock.'

By late Tuesday, the violence extended to Tel Aviv, which came under fire from a barrage of rockets launched from the Gaza Strip. The outgoing volleys set off air raid sirens across the city, and the main international airport quickly closed

Since the sirens began late Monday, barrages of rockets launched from the Hamas-controlled Palestinian enclave have rained down on the coastal city, located just north of the Gaza Strip.

The deluge continued on Tuesday, with Hamas' armed wing the Qassam Brigades saying it had fired 137 rockets on Ashkelon and nearby Ashdod within just five minutes during the afternoon.

Islamic Jihad, an ally of Hamas, announced on Tuesday that two of its commanders were killed during continued Israeli air strikes on the Gaza Strip.

Sources within the group said the strikes in central Gaza, also 'wounded eight people, including a woman and her two children.'

On Tuesday, Israel Defence Forces (IDF) claimed it had killed a top Hamas Commander in a statement , saying: 'We just killed the commander of the Hamas anti-tank missile unit, Iyad Fathi Faik Sharir. He was in charge of carrying out anti-tank missile attacks on Israel. Our aircraft are currently striking additional terror targets'.

Other high-profile Hamas targets are also said to have been killed. One was identified as Samah Abed al-Mamlouk, who the IDF said was in a hideout along with other operatives. He is said to have been in charge of the Islamic Jihad's rocket arsenal.

The United Nations said it was 'deeply concerned' over the escalation of violence in the region, warning Israel that Palestinians must be allowed the freedom to congregate and protest.

'We condemn all violence and all incitement to violence and ethnic division and provocations,' spokesman Rupert Colville told reporters in Geneva on Tuesday.

He added: 'No force should be used against those exercising their rights peacefully.' When use of force is necessary, it should comply fully with international human rights standards, he added.

Colville said the office of UN rights chief Michelle Bachelet was particularly concerned about the impact of the violence on children.

Lindsey Graham said former President Donald Trump's second impeachment trial set such a bad precedent that House Republicans, if they retake the majority, will go after Vice President Kamala Harris for her Black Lives Matter support.

'If you use this model, I don't know how Kamala Harris doesn't get impeached if the Republicans take over the House, because she actually bailed out rioters and one of the rioters went back to the streets and broke somebody's head open,' Graham told Chris Wallace on 'Fox News Sunday.'

Graham, a top Trump ally in the Senate, called the ex-president the 'most potent force' in the Republican Party and suggested Trump's daughter-in-law Lara Trump would likely win the 2022 North Carolina GOP Senate primary after retiring incumbent Sen. Richard Burr voted in favor of Trump's conviction.

Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham said Sunday that he believed President Donald Trump's second impeachment trial set such a bad precedent that if Republicans win back the House they'll try to impeach Vice President Kamala Harris for her Black Lives Matter support

'Democrats have sat on the sidelines and watched the country be burned down for a year and a half and hadn’t said a damn word and most Republicans are tired of the hypocrisy,' Graham said, after suggesting Harris (pictured) could be impeached over backing a bail-out fund for BLM protesters

The twice acquitted Trump was spotted golfing Sunday at his West Palm Beach, Florida Trump International Golf Course. Graham said on 'Fox News Sunday' he planned to travel to Florida to visit with the ex-president soon

Graham said he objected to the speed in which the House of Representatives, which is controlled by the Democrats, impeached Trump on the heels of the January 6 insurrection.

'He is the first president to ever be impeached without a lawyer, without a witness, without an ability to confront those against him and the trial record was a complete joke, hearsay upon hearsay and we've opened Pandora's box to future presidents,' Graham said.

Graham said Democrats did this 'because they hate his guts.'

'This thing is turning into a nightmare for the presidency,' the South Carolina Republican offered.

He pointed to Harris as someone equally impeachable because on June 1, the then U.S. senator asked Americans to help protesters reacting to the Memorial Day death of George Floyd to donate to the Minnesota Freedom Fund.

Since then, a number of reports have come out that said the Minnesota Freedom Fund helped release rape and murder subjects from jail while they were awaiting trial.

The organization's aim is to release those awaiting trial 'as we seek to end discriminatory, coercive, and oppressive jailing.'

'Democrats have sat on the sidelines and watched the country be burned down for a year and a half and hadn’t said a damn word and most Republicans are tired of the hypocrisy,' Graham argued.

Graham was echoing the whataboutism on display Sunday by Trump's defense lawyer Michael van der Veen, who went as far to say that MAGA rioters were actually inspired by the summer's Black Lives Matter protests when they attacked the Capitol Building.

'Many of the people who infiltrated the Capitol took pictures of themselves and posted them on social media,' van der Veen pointed out. 'To some, it seems, they thought it was all a game. They apparently believe that violent mobs, destruction of property, rioting, assaulting police and vandalizing historic treasures was somehow now acceptable in the United States.'

Graham (right) made the comments on 'Fox News Sunday' with Chris Wallace (left), where he also called Trump the 'most potent force' in the Republican Party and said Trump's daughter-in-law, Lara Trump, would likely win the 2022 North Carolina GOP Senate primary

The former president is seen on his West Palm Beach golf course Sunday, as Graham referred to him as 'the most vibrant member of the Republican Party' as well as the 'most potent member'

'Where might they have gotten that idea?' the Trump lawyer mused. 'I would suggest to you that it was not from Mr. Trump.'

'I submit to you that it was month after month of political leaders and media personalities, bloodthirsty for ratings, glorifying civil unrest and condemning the reasonable law enforcement measures that are required to quell violent mobs,' van der Veen said.

Democratic House impeachment managers were trying to convince senators that Trump was directly responsible for inciting the insurrection on January 6.

They came 10 Republican votes shy of conviction.

Wallace asked Graham if he thought Trump beared any responsibility for the MAGA riot.

'No, in terms of law, no,' the senator said. 'He bears responsibility of pushing narratives about the election that I think are not sound and not true, but this was politically protected speech.'

Graham also wasn't swayed by the last bit of evidence the House Democratic impeachment managers got added to the record - a statement by Rep. Jaime Herrera Beutler that detailed a call between Trump and House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy.

In the call, Trump resists calling off the mob, and initially doesn't believe it's his supporters responsible for the attack.

'It doesn't tell me a whole lot, because it's all hearsay,' Graham said.

The South Carolina senator then expressed that he believed Trump needed to stay central to the Republican Party.

Graham said he planned to go visit the ex-president in Florida soon.

On Sunday, Trump, who's been living at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach, was spotted golfing at nearby course.

'Donald Trump is the most vibrant member of the Republican Party. The Trump movement is alive and well. People believe he brought change to Washington. Policy wise it was long overdue,' he said.

'All I can say is that the most potent force in the Republican Party is President Trump. We need Trump-plus and at the end of the day, I’ve been involved in politics for over 25 years, the president is a handful and what happened on January 6th was terrible for the country, but he's not singularly to blame,' Graham continued.

Graham said that former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley was wrong to say that the party should walk away from Trump.

'North Carolina, the biggest winner I think of this whole impeachment trial is Lara Trump,' he added. 'My dear friend Richard Burr who I like and have been friends to a long time just made Lara Trump almost a certain nominee for the Senate seat in North Carolina to replace him.'

Burr was one of seven Republican senators who voted Saturday for Trump's conviction. He previously announced his retirement from the Senate after the current term.

Lara Trump hasn't said if she'll pursue the Senate seat yet.

'If she runs - and I’ll certainly would be behind her because I think she represents the future of the Republican Party,' Graham said.",Graham predicts House Republicans will impeach Kamala Harris over Black Lives Matter support,1

A large black bear, accompanied by her cubs, has visited every summer for the last six years with neighbors welcoming her - and let the family share their food.

Michael Costello, who lives in Farmington, Connecticut, said: 'She comes down every year. One mama bear and her cubs.

'I know it's the same bear because she's double-tagged. It's one mama bear who's raised several generations of cubs. She has four cubs this year.'

In the adorable footage, one cub is climbing onto the half-submerged pool cover to paddle around in the water, before a second little bear joins him.

Yet another cub decided to follow his siblings in exploring the pool, diving underwater with just its ears and nose visible. Afterwards, the cub went to roll around in the wood chips.

But the bear family isn't done exploring just yet, as they head indoors into the garage to find some food.

Michael says the bear is - perhaps concerningly - comfortable in the neighborhood and has started coming into his house to get at bird feed and peanut butter in his pantry.

The bear has also used his swimming pool, a neighbor's trampoline and has been seen sitting on their porches with their cats.

https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/apr/23/pandemic-potentially-a-death-sentence-for-many-prison-inmates-experts-warn,1,"Chronic overcrowding and underfunding have left prisons around the world vulnerable to being ravaged by coronavirus, criminal justice experts have warned.

The challenges of a record global prison population of 11 million have been brought to light in a report published by Penal Reform International (PRI) which found that 102 countries have prison occupancy levels of more than 110%.

Social distancing and personal infection control are almost impossible in overcrowded settings where poor ventilation and sanitation are likely increase the speed at which the virus spreads.

Florian Irminger, executive director of PRI, said: “Prison systems globally were at crisis point before the coronavirus pandemic. Now prisons across the world are ticking time bombs set to be devastated by this virus because of overcrowding, lack of basic healthcare, limited access to clean water … and inhumane living conditions.”

In Bangladesh 10 doctors serve 68 prisons, while Ghana has two doctors covering 46 prisons with 15,000 inmates.

Overcrowding and inhumane detention conditions are key factors contributing to poor health, said the report, published jointly with the Thailand Institute of Justice. In October 2019, 45 deaths caused by malnutrition and lack of medical care were reported in Bukavu prison in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, which exceeds its capacity by 528%.

Outbreaks of Covid-19 and deaths from the virus have been recorded in prisons in numerous countries including China, Iran, Kenya, India, Belgium, Spain and the UK.

There are grave concerns about the impact the pandemic will have on prisons across sub-Saharan Africa, where the full force of Covid-19 is yet to be felt.

Doreen Namyalo Kyazze, PRI’s Africa programme manager in Kampala, said: “It is frankly terrifying to think how Covid-19 will impact on prisons in the region, which are some of the most severely overcrowded in the world and are extremely lacking in healthcare services, as well as the most basic sanitary conditions.

“In some cases, civil society has had to provide vital supplies for prisoners such as soap, basins, water and medicines to meet their basic health needs.”

One female inmate at a Sierra Leone prison told researchers: “We have been deprived of water as there is no tap and the well gets dry. We have to manage with the limited water we have.”

A prison officer at the same facility revealed there were 64 inmates living in a space designed for 18: “Overcrowding is a big challenge in terms of where to keep inmates and how to ensure hygiene and water supply. We have been using offices as cells for inmates, some even share a bed because there is no space.”

Olivia Rope, director of policy at PRI, said only bold, coordinated international action could mitigate the damage of Covid-19 in prisons, where the mortality rate is already up to 50% higher than in the outside world.

“Your life is literally at greater risk when detained … [and] violence in places of detention is increasing, with crisis responses triggering the use of riot squads, which often turn out to be fatal,” she said.

Prisons in more than 100 countries operate above their occupancy rates, with 20 countries at double their capacity limit. “The spread of Covid-19 in some of these prisons could – and in some cases is already – a death sentence”, said Rope.

Pakistan has 10,000 confirmed cases of Covid-19, with 98 confirmed cases in prisons according to Sarah Belal of the Justice Project Pakistan. Both figures are thought to be grossly underestimated due to lack of widespread testing.

The virus has lifted the lid on existing systemic issues, said Belal: “The capacity of our prisons is 63,000 but we have 74,118 prisoners … there is just no way we have the capacity to manage with the number of people that are in our prisons, neither do we have the resources.

“In Punjab alone, before Covid-19 there were 108 vacant posts for medical officers, there is usually one in each prison … 10% of Punjab prisons did not have ambulances, and the rate of tuberculosis and hepatitis was rampant. You are looking at a population that is already extremely vulnerable to dying of an infectious disease like Covid-19.”

The UN assistant secretary general for human rights, Ilze Brands Kehris, has called on states to reduce their prison populations, including by releasing those who are vulnerable to the virus or are low-risk offenders.

Measures have already been taken in some countries that have suffered outbreaks. In France, courts were asked to delay short-term prison sentences, while states including Iran and Kenya opted to release some people from prison early.

In the UK, where the Ministry of Justice confirmed earlier this week that 15 prisoners have died from Covid-19, the government’s temporary release scheme to combat the spread of the virus had to be suspended after six inmates were mistakenly freed. Plans to release 4,000 risk-assessed prisoners within two months of release are due to resume this week.","Pandemic potentially a 'death sentence' for many prison inmates, experts warn",1
https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/mar/07/police-use-water-cannon-in-georgia-to-disperse-protests-at-authoritarian-law,1,"Police in the former Soviet state of Georgia have used water cannon and teargas in an attempt to disperse thousands of people who rallied on Tuesday night after parliament gave its initial backing to a draft law on “foreign agents” which critics say represents an authoritarian shift.

Some protesters threw petrol bombs and stones at police in the centre of the capital Tbilisi, as demonstrators warned that the draft law could hurt the south Caucasus country’s hopes of EU membership.

The law, backed by the ruling Dream party, would require any organisations receiving more than 20% of their funding from overseas to register as “foreign agents”, or face substantial fines.

Critics have said it is reminiscent of a 2012 law in Russia that has since been used to crack down on dissent.

Georgia’s president, Salome Zourabichvili, has said she intends to veto the law if it crosses her desk but the parliament could override her veto. She expressed solidarity with the protesters on Tuesday.

“You represent a free Georgia, a Georgia which sees its future in the west, and won’t let anyone to take this future away,” she said in an address recorded in the US, where she is on an official visit.

“Nobody needs this law … everyone who has voted for this law has violated the constitution,” she said.

Protesters angrily remonstrated with police armed with riot shields who then used teargas and water cannon. At least three petrol bombs, as well as stones, were thrown at police.

People suffering from the effects of teargas were being treated on the steps outside the parliament building.

“I came here because I know that my country belongs to Europe, but my government doesn’t understand it”, said 30-year-old protester Demetre Shanshiashvili.

“We are here to protect our country because we don’t want to be part of Russia again,” he added, referring to the almost two centuries Georgia spent as part of the Russian Empire and Soviet Union.

Earlier, the law had comfortably passed its first parliamentary reading, Georgian media outlets reported.

Some of the protesters gathered outside the parliament building carried Georgian, EU and US flags, and shouted: “No to the Russian law,” and “You are Russian” at politicians inside the legislature.

Russia is viewed as an enemy by many Georgians, after Moscow backed separatists in the breakaway Georgian regions of Abkhazia and South Ossetia in the 1990s. Hundreds of thousands of Georgians remain internally displaced within the country after several bouts of bloody ethnic conflict.

Speaking in Berlin on Tuesday, the Georgian prime minister, Irakli Garibashvili reaffirmed his support for the law, saying the proposed provisions on foreign agents met “European and global standards”.

The ruling party, which says it wants Georgia to join the EU, has accused critics of the bill of opposing the Georgian Orthodox Church, one of the country’s most respected and influential institutions.

On Monday, a committee hearing on the law ended in a brawl in parliament.

More than 60 civil society organisations and media outlets have said they will not comply with the bill if it is signed into law.

Georgia’s government has in recent years faced criticism from observers, who say the country is drifting towards authoritarianism.

Social media companies are increasingly facing criticism over their role in allowing graphic content and misinformation to be shared.

'Switch it off if you can. Switch it off,' Environment Minister Tanya Plibersek said on ABC News on Wednesday.

'I really don't think that the social media companies are doing as much as they ought to be to support the police in their efforts to keep calm in the community.'

E-Safety Commissioner Julie Inman Grant told ABC Radio she would consider legal options against X and Meta, the parent company of Facebook, after issuing removal notices for extreme material on Tuesday.

The companies have 24 hours to act.

'I wouldn't say that they don't care,' Grant said, adding 'unfortunately, we have seen a ratcheting back of trust and safety operations across the platforms and across the industry.'

Asked by a listener whether she had the power to shut down X in Australia, Grant said she had a wide range of powers including 'different kinds of court notices', which she would consider at 2.30pm on Wednesday once the 24-hour window had expired.

A 16-year-old boy has been arrested and charged over what investigators labelled a religiously motivated terror attack on Monday at Christ the Good Shepherd Church at Wakeley in the city's west.

https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/aug/18/enrique-tarrio-proud-boys-sentencing-jan-6,1,"The US justice department is seeking 33 years in prison for Enrique Tarrio, the former Proud Boys leader convicted of seditious conspiracy in one of the most serious cases to emerge from the attack on the US Capitol, according to court documents.

The harsh sentence request came as it emerged that Christopher Worrell, another member of the extremist group, has disappeared, days before he was due to be sentenced on Friday

The sentence for Tarrio, if imposed, would be by far the longest punishment that has been handed down in the massive prosecution of the riot on 6 January 2021. The Oath Keepers founder Stewart Rhodes, who was convicted of seditious conspiracy in a separate case, has received the longest sentence to date – 18 years.

Tarrio, who once served as national chairman of the far-right extremist group, and three lieutenants were convicted by a Washington jury in May of conspiring to block the transfer of presidential power in the hopes of keeping Donald Trump in the White House after the Republican president lost the 2020 election.

Tarrio, who was not at the Capitol riot itself, was a top target of what has become the largest justice department investigation in American history. He led the neo-fascist group – known for street fights with leftwing activists – when Trump infamously told the Proud Boys to “stand back and stand by” during his first election debate with Democrat Joe Biden.

During the months-long trial, prosecutors argued that the Proud Boys viewed themselves as foot soldiers fighting for Trump as the Republican spread lies that Democrats stole the election from him, and were prepared to go to war to keep their preferred leader in power.

“They unleashed a force on the Capitol that was calculated to exert their political will on elected officials by force and to undo the results of a democratic election,” prosecutors wrote in their filing on Thursday. “The foot soldiers of the right aimed to keep their leader in power. They failed. They are not heroes; they are criminals.”

Meanwhile on Friday it emerged that the authorities are looking for Worrell, of Naples, Florida, who was “unaccounted for” ahead of his sentencing. He was convicted of using pepper-spray gel on police officers as part of the mob storming the Capitol in 2021.

Worrell had been under house arrest in Florida since his release from jail in Washington in November 2021, less than a month after a judge substantiated his civil-rights complaints about his treatment in the jail.

Prosecutors had asked a judge to sentence Worrell to 14 years. Court records show the sentencing was canceled on Tuesday and a warrant issued for his arrest, initially under seal.

More than three dozen people charged in the Capitol siege have been identified by federal authorities as leaders, members or associates of the Proud Boys, whose members describe it as a politically incorrect men’s club for “western chauvinists”.

As well as the long sentence for Tarrio, prosecutors are also asking for a 33-year-sentence for one of Tarrio’s co-defendants, Joseph Biggs of Ormond Beach, Florida, a self-described Proud Boys organizer.

They are asking the judge to impose a 30-year prison term for Zachary Rehl, who was president of the Proud Boys chapter in Philadelphia; 27 years in prison for Ethan Nordean of Auburn, Washington, who was a Proud Boys chapter president; and 20 years for Dominic Pezzola, a Proud Boys member from Rochester, New York.

A total of about 1,000 people have been charged with federal crimes related to the January 6 riot. More than 600 of them have pleaded guilty or been convicted after trials decided by a jury or judge.

'It's worse now because in 30 years since what happened to Rodney the situation with police has gotten worse not better.

'Now, a black man, George Floyd can be murdered by police in cold blood.'

Dennetta, 55, spoke as violent protests and widespread looting is expected to continue across Los Angeles for a fifth day in wake of Floyd's death on Memorial Day in Minneapolis.

On Saturday afternoon Mayor Eric Garcetti told Angelenos, 'This is not 1992,' saying he had no plans to call in the National Guard as thousands of people took to the streets to protest.

The mayor quickly revised his statement later in the day, however, asking California's governor to deploy 500 National Guard troops to LA - reminiscent of the military presence during the 1992 trouble.

Sadly, Dennetta fears the scenes we're witnessing on the streets of LA are worse than 28 years ago.

Dennetta, 55, spoke as violent protests and widespread looting is expected to continue across Los Angeles for a fifth day in wake of Floyd's death on Memorial Day in Minneapolis

And she feels the Los Angeles Police Department has learned little since her husband Rodney was almost beaten to death by four white LAPD officers with batons during an arrest.

She said Rodney, who died in 2012, would also have encouraged people to remain calm if he was still alive - echoing the famous words he spoke in the midst of the 1992 riots in which he called for people to 'get along'.

Dennetta too calls for the violence and looting in LA to stop, but says the protests against what happened to George Floyd and police violence against the black community must continue.

Floyd, a black man, had begged for help and said he couldn't breathe as his neck was pinned under the knee of white police officer Derek Chauvin during an arrest last week in Minneapolis.

'If Rodney was alive today, he would be hurt by what happened to George and the rioting,' she said.

'We're in a worse position now than 30 years ago because our lives don't matter.

'I don't think LAPD has learned from Rodney to this day and I wish that was not the case but it is.

'I think LAPD is as bad as Minnesota Police.

'Honestly I do not know where they get some of their officers from.

'It's like they deliberately get officers who don't like minorities. They're failing because they're not seriously tackling the racism problem.'

She said Rodney, who died in 2012, would also have encouraged people to remain calm if he was still alive - echoing the famous words he spoke in the midst of the 92' riots in which he called for people to 'get along'

'The police think they can do whatever they want. They are meant to protect and serve the people but they are serving themselves.

'I hope the violence does end now otherwise I'm worried someone is going to get killed. I'm scared.'

She added: 'Please, protest in peace. Violence is not making the point, that's losing the message.'

Dennetta, the mother of Rodney's daughter Lora, said the law should also be changed so that more police officers like those that attacked Rodney and George Floyd can be prosecuted.

She said: 'It's like the justice system just can't get them to jail right now, that's what we as a community need to address.

'We have to be at the meetings where laws are made so that we have a real voice. Let's get our people into positions of power, to speak and use their voices.'

Speaking about the shocking death of Floyd in Minnesota over a week ago, she said: 'I couldn't believe what I was seeing on the news.

'It was awful, to see him crying out for his life, his mom.

'The cop had his hands in his pockets as if it was something he did every day. It hurt my heart.

'I didn't think it would be a repeat of '92 at first but I did when the officers involved didn't get arrested straight away.

'All four who were there should have been arrested. Not just the one guy. And he should be charged with first-degree murder, nothing less.'

'Between the gang banging and the police, what's this country going to be like for him?

'His mom Lora is doing great things with The Rodney King Foundation. I'm so proud of her and what she's doing.

'She wants peace, education and social justice, which I support, and the foundation gives scholarships to African American fathers.

'She's unhappy with the violence but she and I understand why it's happening.'

She said if she could speak to Floyd's family, she would ask them to find comfort in prayer.

'What they're going through, I would say to them pray every day. Ask God to help you, it's the only thing that can truly help you. They will want to be mad and angry but that is no good for them.'

Dennetta, who lives in San Pedro, California, said she hasn't been able to attend any of the protests herself due to health problems and she's also 'nervous' about the violence.

'I've been on peace walks with My Tribe Rise and been feeding the homeless and I'm looking forward to continuing that work,' she said.

Can we stop making it horrible for the older people and the kids? It's just not right. It's not right. It's not going to change anything. We'll get our justice.'

https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/feb/24/emmanuel-macron-opens-paris-agricultural-fair-to-protests-from-farmers,1,"Hundreds of protesting farmers clashed with police in Paris as Emmanuel Macron toured the annual agricultural fair on Saturday. The French president had opened the fair as angry farmers blew whistles and shouted insults.

Riot police initially kept the protesters at a safe distance as he toured the fair, tasting honey from Normandy and cheeses from the Alps, and shaking hands with exhibitors. But as he entered the fair’s livestock area, hundreds of demonstrators crashed the gates and clashed with police.

In the ensuing confusion, the fair was repeatedly closed and then reopened to the public. Police arrested three people for creating disturbances but they were later released, Paris prosecutors said.

In a separate incident, farmers poured manure on the stand of dairy company Lactalis, which they accuse of not paying enough for its milk.

Farmers’ leaders had warned Macron that his visit to the fair – a fixture of the presidential calendar – would not go smoothly if the government had not delivered on their promises to meet their demands.

He had begun the day at the fair with a two-hour meeting with the leaders of the three main farmers unions: the Fédération Nationale des Syndicats d’Exploitants Agricoles (FNSEA), Jeunes Agriculteurs and Coordination Rurale.

Standing at a plastic table, his jacket off and shirt sleeves rolled up, the president listened to complaints about prices, red tape and state aid. It was a step down from the national debate he had originally planned before scrapping it after a row over who could be invited.

“I always prefer dialogue to confrontation,” Macron said. “I am telling you that work is being done on the ground, we are in the process of simplifying things.”

Lindsey Graham blasted the move by House impeachment managers to connect President Trump through tweets and statements to Proud Boys and other violent extremists who stormed the Capitol.

The presentation by the managers at Wednesday's start of the impeachment trial stretched by to the first presidential debate when Trump took heat for failing to condemn the group and white supremacy when asked about it.

Trump told the far right group at the Sept. 30th debate to 'stand back and stand by' when asked about it by moderator Chris Wallace. As the managers pointed out, numerous Proud Boy members were spotted at the riot, and federal authorities have arrested Proud Boy members in connection with the riot.

'The legal theory they have is absurd – that somehow that Trump’s a secret member of the Proud boys,' said Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), scoffing at arguments connecting Trump to the rioters who took the Capitol

Graham, a close advisor to Trump while in office who has blasted the impeachment effort, slammed the argument Wednesday.

“The legal theory they have is absurd – that somehow that Trump’s a secret member of the Proud boys,' he scoffed.

He said the videos mustered by managers made him 'mad' and said Capitol Police ' had every right to use deadly force, they should have used it. The people in charge of securing the Capitol left the country.'

But he also predicted Democrats weren't picking up support in the court of impeachment, where most GOP senators already appear locked in.

The impeachment trial recounted Graham calling Ivanka Trump pleading her to get Trump to call off his supporters

'You realize that there were people, insurrectionists, that tried to affect the peaceful transfer of power and that should give anyone who loves our republic great pause,' said Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-La.)

The trial revealed how Sen. Mitt Romney was redirected away from the angry mob by a Capitol police officer

In this image from video, House impeachment manager Del. Stacey Plaskett, D-Virgin Islands, speaks during the second impeachment trial of former President Donald Trump in the Senate at the U.S. Capitol in Washington, Wednesday, Feb. 10, 2021

'Well I think there's more votes for acquittal after today than there was yesterday. Because hypocrisy is pretty large for these people, standing up to, you know, rioters when they came to my house, Susan Collins’ house, I think this is a very hypocritical presentation by the House,' he said.

He was making an argument, derided by some as 'what about-ism,' about protesters who have protested or harassed lawmakers – although Graham's most recent encounter with protesters came at a Washington, DC airport when he was harangued by Trump supporters calling him a 'traitor.'

Impeachment managers stressed the role of members of the Proud Boys, pictured here in Portland, in the riot

Graham also made an appearance at the trial when Rep. David Cicilline (D-R.I.) brought up his pleas to Ivanka Trump to intervene to get the president to call off the mob. Cicilline was constructing an argument that Trump did 'nothing' to call off his rampaging supporters.

'It took him awhile to appreciate the gravity of the situation,' Graham told the Washington Post after January 6th.

Sen. Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, who joined five other Republicans in voting that the trial was constitutional Tuesday, made a statement Wednesday connecting the riots directly to the counting of the electoral votes – which relates to the Democratic charge that Trump incited it for his own ends.

'There's so much to say that should be taken away. How do you narrow it?' said Cassidy, who faced backlash from the state Republican Party after his vote.

'You realize that there were people, insurrectionists, that tried to affect the peaceful transfer of power and that should give anyone who loves our republic great pause,' he said.

But there were not signs of any major visible shift in where the votes are, even after managers aired jarring footage of Trump supporters throwing objects and hurling obscenities at Capitol Police officers, bashing in windows, and revealed security footage showing just how close senators and House members were to the job.

One senator who wasn't persuaded by the evidence was Missouri Republican Josh Hawley. He was spotted viewing the proceedings from the Senate visitor's gallery rather than the floor. Senate rules on impeachment are so strict that they mention imprisonment for those who speak out of turn during the proceedings.

Bannon's rollercoaster saga in the public eye took another unfortunate turn Friday when a federal judge sentenced him to four months in prison following his conviction on contempt of Congress charges.

Things could have gone worse for the former chief White House strategist and defiant podcaster, with Judge Carl Nichols imposing a modest $6,500 fine for criminal contempt for his defiance of a congressional subpoena from the House January 6th committee.

Bannon will have no trouble paying the fine, and could have had to shell out much more after refusing to participate in the committee process and declining to speak on his own behalf.

Former chief White House strategist Steve Bannon was sentenced to four months in prison for defying a congressional subpoena. His lawyer David Schoen says he has a 'bulletproof' appeal coming

And he gets to remain out of prison – for now – after Judge Nichols allowed him to remain free pending an appeal, which his lawyer David Schoen claimed was 'bulletproof.'

The sentence came as Bannon is still facing trial in New York based on corruption charges related to the 'We Build the Wall' scheme, after Donald Trump issued a preemptive pardon of federal charges in his final hours as president.

Bannon was convicted in June of contempt of Congress for defying a subpoena from the committee investigating the January 6 Capitol riot.

A jury found Bannon, 68, guilty of two misdemeanor counts for refusing to provide testimony or documents to the House of Representatives select committee.

He faced up to two years in federal prison. But prosecutors had sought only six months. His lawyers countered with probation and asked for home confinement.

Each count carries a minimum sentence of 30 days in jail, as well as a fine of $100 to $100,000.

The verdict by the jury of eight men and four women, after less than three hours of deliberations, marked the first successful prosecution for contempt of Congress since 1974, when a judge found G. Gordon Liddy, a conspirator in the Watergate scandal that prompted President Richard Nixon's resignation, guilty.

His conviction ends a chapter for a stunning rise and fall for a man who seemingly came out of nowhere to lead Donald Trump to the presidency.

The famed flame-thrower was Trump's campaign manager in the final stages of the 2016 election, having risen from his role at Breitbart to become one of the most influential right-wing voices.

Bannon joined Trump in the White House but fell out with him in spectacular fashion and turned on Trump and, in particular, his son-in-law Jared Kushner.

He was forced out and roamed Europe trying to set up a right-wing political movement across the continent, before returning to the US where in August he was arrested for allegedly attempting to defraud Trump supporters who donated to a crowdfunded effort to build the U.S.-Mexico border wall.

The former investment banker was arrested on August 20, 2020 on a $28 million yacht, owned by a fugitive Chinese billionaire.

Bannon was the campaign CEO for its last 88 days after the ousting of Paul Manafort - who became a convicted felon himself.

He was pardoned by Trump on the eve of the president's departure from the White House as a remarkable reward for loyally insisting that the election was stolen.

The Virginia-born strategist, who worked alongside Kellyanne Conway as campaign manager, encouraged Trump to go after his primary opponents, clash with Republican Party elites, and launch tirades against China and global trade.

Bannon was seen as being a driving force behind attempts to frame a populist appeal to 'forgotten' Americans.

He had informally advised Trump before jumping on board from the conservative Breitbart website, which was backed by billionaire Rebekah Mercer.

He became, in the White House, Trump's Chief Strategist, with a West Wing office close to the Oval Office.

Bannon clashed with many within the White House - in particular Jared Kushner (right)

Bannon dismissed Kushner and his wife, Ivanka Trump, as 'globalists' and openly mocked them

Bannon for a while had the ear of the president, but made the fatal mistake of clashing with the other power center: Kushner and Ivanka Trump, who Bannon sneeringly named Javanka.

He fought internecine battles and sometimes forged unexpected partnerships with Trump's first chief of staff, Reince Preibus, during chaotic early days of the Trump administration.

But after it was revealed he had been cooperating with Michael Wolff in his scathing Trump takedown, Fire and Fury, the president fired him, in August 2017.

Not only had Bannon consented to on-record interviews, he took aim at Trump family members, including Donald Trump Jr.

He called the infamous 2016 Trump Tower meeting about dirt on Hillary Clinton that was attended by Trump Jr., Paul Manafort, and Kushner 'treasonous' and 'unpatriotic.'

He predicted of authorities: 'They're going to crack Don Jr. like an egg.'

Wolff reported in 2018 that Bannon told investigators: 'Even if you thought that this was not treasonous, or unpatriotic, or bad s**t, and I happen to think it's all of that, you should have called the FBI immediately.'

Bannon, pictured in the White House in January 2017, made many enemies within the team

Trump in characteristic fashion distanced himself with Bannon after throwing him overboard.

'Steve Bannon has nothing to do with me or my presidency' Trump said at the time.

'When he was fired, he not only lost his job, he lost his mind.'

After he was out at the White House, Bannon was subpoenaed by Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigators who were probing Trump campaign contacts with Russians.

He reportedly met with them for 20 hours, speaking on multiple occasions, and his assessments are reflected in the Mueller report.

The former Goldman Sachs banker is worth an estimated $48 million, according to White House financial disclosures made in 2017.

He has enjoyed an eye-catchingly varied career, including a stint during the early 1990s as boss of the Biosphere 2 experiment, which locked scientists way in a greenhouse for two years to see if they could become self-sufficient.

He lost his lucrative backing from Robert Mercer and his daughter Rebekah, after the publication of Fire and Fury. He also lost his job at Breitbart, which pushed him to seek new horizons.

From his base at an 800-year-old monastery outside of Rome, Bannon travelled to Paris, telling the far-right Front National that 'history is on our side and will bring us victory'.

Bannon for a while had the ear of the president, but made the fatal mistake of clashing with the other power center: Kushner and Ivanka Trump, who Bannon sneeringly named Javanka

Italy was unimpressed, and last year, Italy's Culture Ministry, which owns the mountaintop monastery, withdrew a 19-year lease, citing violations of contractual obligations.

In May that ruling was overturned, allowing work on the Dignitatis Humanae Institute think-tank to continue.

More recently Bannon has retained some of his power as an influential Trump world voice, appearing frequently on television and running a podcast where Trump aides are guests. There have been persistent reports of regular contact between the two men, but no known in person meetings.

Trump - who fell out with the former Breitbart editor in spectacular fashion, dismissing him in August 2017 as washed-up 'Sloppy Steve' - tried to distance himself from Bannon, saying: 'I haven't been dealing with him for a very long period of time.'

Bannon was the eighth close Trump associate to be arrested or convicted of a crime, a list that also includes former campaign chairman Paul Manafort, longtime friend and adviser Roger Stone, former national security adviser Michael Flynn and former personal lawyer Michael Cohen.

Bannon helped make confronting China a centerpiece of Trump's 2016 campaign, a posture the president has continued into his tenure in office.

Another key tenet of that election was building a wall on the southern border that Trump said Mexico – not the U.S. government – would pay for.

Bannon began scheming to start a new U.S. political party that he planned to call the 'National Union Party' - the temporary name Abraham Lincoln and the Republican Party had adopted in 1864 to attract War Democrats and Unionists - imagining that he could unite disaffected populists on both ends of the political spectrum and make his own run at the White House.",How the multimillionaire Steve Bannon went from the White House to jail sentence,1

The eight others were sentenced to seven months behind bars for illegally crossing the border.

The sentencing follows the imposition of a sweeping new security law in Hong Kong this year that has given the government broad powers to prosecute political dissidents.

A number of activists have fled the city for overseas and political organisations have shuttered their doors as Beijing seeks to keep a lid on unrest that rocked the financial hub for months last year.

The 10 adults in the group first appeared before the Shenzhen court on Monday, but the trial - like many in China's opaque legal system - was not open to foreign reporters or diplomats

The pair arrived back in the city around noon on Wednesday.

The 10 adults in the group first appeared before the Shenzhen court on Monday, but the trial - like many in China's opaque legal system - was not open to foreign reporters or diplomats.

These 10 were also fined up to 20,000 yuan (US$3,060) in addition to their jail terms.

But the Yantian District People's Procuratorate said it would not pursue its case against the two teenagers, surnamed Hoang and Liu.

Families of the accused were only notified of the trial date three days before the hearing and were unable to attend due to the short notice and Covid-19 restrictions.

Following the passing of the National Security Law that would tighten on freedom of expression, Hong Kong protesters marched on the streets to demonstrate

Their lawyers were barred from meeting the detainees, with authorities instead appointing state-approved legal representation.

The lawyers on Wednesday said the sentences were too heavy and the allegation of organising a border crossing was not substantiated.

The United States on Monday called for the immediate release of the group who it said was 'fleeing tyranny'.

'Communist China will stop at nothing to prevent its people from seeking freedom elsewhere,' a US embassy spokesperson said.

Some of the group were already facing prosecution in Hong Kong. The two minors face charges of conspiracy to commit arson and possession of an offensive weapon.

The security law that now blankets Hong Kong gives authorities sweeping powers of prosecution for acts deemed terrorism, secession, subversion or collusion with foreign entities. Pictured: A man is detained by riot police during a demonstration

Amnesty International said in a statement that the group were at risk of torture serving sentences in mainland Chinese jails.

'These sentences meted out after an unfair trial lay bare the dangers faced by anybody who finds themselves tried under the Chinese criminal system,' said Amnesty International's Asia-Pacific Regional Director Yamini Mishra.

'The Chinese authorities have shown the world once again that political activists will not receive a fair trial.'

China's foreign ministry on Monday pushed back against comments by foreign countries on the case.

Beijing says the new security law was needed to restore peace and stability but critics have condemned it as a fatal attack on Hong Kong's freedoms

Washington must 'immediately stop interfering in China's internal affairs through the Hong Kong issue and immediately stop interfering in China's judicial sovereignty', spokesman Zhao Lijian told reporters.

In a joint letter over the weekend, the families said they 'strongly condemn' the authorities' decision to hold the trial in 'de facto secret'.

The security law that now blankets Hong Kong gives authorities sweeping powers of prosecution for acts deemed terrorism, secession, subversion or collusion with foreign entities.

The city had enjoyed unique freedoms since its handover from Britain in 1997, with a deal promising a 'one country, two systems' arrangement for 50 years.

https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-9209781/America-vows-action-Myanmar-military-coup-not-reversed.html,1,"President Joe Biden on Monday threatened new sanctions on Myanmar after its military staged a coup and arrested the civilian leaders of its government, including Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi - and pointedly called the country 'Burma.'

Warning: Joe Biden said he will consider sanctions in the wake of the coup which unfolded on Monday morning

Biden assailed the country's armed forces for the coup, calling it a 'direct assault on the country's transition to democracy and rule of law.'

The coup has been roundly condemned internationally.

'The United States removed sanctions on Burma over the past decade based on progress toward democracy,' Biden said in a statement.

'The reversal of that progress will necessitate an immediate review of our sanction laws and authorities, followed by appropriate action. The United States will stand up for democracy wherever it is under attack.'

Myanmar has been a Western democracy promotion project for decades and had been a symbol of some success. But over the past several years, there have been growing concerns about its backsliding into authoritarianism. Disappointment with Suu Kyi, the former opposition leader, has run high, especially over her resistance to reining in repression of Rohingya Muslims in the country's west.

Secretary of State Antony Blinken had condemned the coup in a statement released overnight, and called for the military to 'reverse these actions immediately'.

The White House's use of 'Burma' not 'Myanmar' is a pointed snub to the coup leaders. The country was renamed Myanmar by the last military junta in 1989, but the name was not adopted by the U.S. and other countries because the regime was not democratically elected.

Myanmar had been used by the U.S. as a 'courtesy,' White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Monday in a tacit suggestion that the coup leaders did not deserve courtesy.

The generals struck amid fears that Suu Kyi would use her new mandate - which saw her humiliate military-backed parties at a vote held last year - to reform the constitution and remove their stranglehold on power.

Military leaders, who claim the vote was fraudulent, have now declared a year-long state of emergency, appointed Vice President Myint Swe - a former general - as acting president, and closed all banks until further notice.

'The United States expresses grave concern and alarm regarding reports that the Burmese military has detained multiple civilian government leaders, including State Counsellor Aung San Suu Kyi, and civil society leaders,' the statement said.

'We call on Burmese military leaders to release all government officials and civil society leaders and respect the will of the people of Burma as expressed in democratic elections on November 8. The United States stands with the people of Burma in their aspirations for democracy, freedom, peace, and development.'

All government functions have been transferred to Senior General Min Aung Hlaing to 'guarantee national stability' until fresh elections can be held, the military said via its own TV channel after state TV went off air, while promising the vote would take place within a year.

The NLD released a statement they said had been written by Suu Kyi before her arrest, which called for people 'to protest against the coup' while warning that generals want to 'put the country back under a dictatorship'.

Along with the US, the UK, Japan and Australia were among those condemning the coup early Monday, with British Prime Minister Boris Johnson saying: 'The vote of the people must be respected and civilian leaders released.'

China - which has been a long-term supporter of the military - urged all sides to 'resolve their differences... to protect political and social stability'.

Myanmar - a former British colony known as Burma - gained independence in 1948, initially as a democracy though with heavy influence from the military which had been instrumental in the fight for self-governance.

But amid rampant infighting, corruption and ethnic persecution, the government lost control and in 1962 the military was invited to form a unity government under a socialist one-party system.

The military junta then ruled Myanmar for the next five decades, until partial elections held in 2010 ushered in a new age of civilian rule from 2011.

Full elections held in 2015 handed power to Suu Kyi's party, though with a guaranteed share of power for the military.

Why has the military staged a coup? Myanmar's military is central to the country's political life - it led the fight for independence in 1948, formed the country's first government, and then ruled as a junta for five decades after abandoning democracy in 1962. That all appeared to change in 2010 with a return to democracy that saw an elected government sworn in - though in reality the military was guaranteed control of key ministries and 25 per cent of seats in parliament. Free elections held in 2015 saw Aung San Suu Kyi's party win a large majority with the military hammered, amid the belief that she would reform the constitution and remove the military from power altogether. More elections held last year handed an even larger share of power to Suu Kyi, prompting fears among military top-brass that their powers were about to be removed. On Monday, just hours before the new government was due to be sworn in, the military struck - arresting Suu Kyi, president Win Myint, and many of the country's most-influential MPs - officially for 'voter fraud'. With border closures already in place and international governments distracted by domestic issues and the coronavirus pandemic, they have faced few obstacles. A year-long state of emergency has now been declared, Vice President Myint Swe - a former general - declared leader, and banks shut until further notice. 'Free' elections will take place after the state of emergency ends, the military has claimed. Advertisement

Elections held last year handed yet-more power to Suu Kyi's party, and - amid fears of constitutional reforms which would strip the military of much of its influence - generals alleged voter fraud and threatened to step in.

With the new government due to be sworn in on Monday, the coup took place in the early hours.

A year-long state of emergency has been declared, power transferred to military leaders, and all banks closed until further notice.

Myo Nyunt, the spokesman for the NLD, said Suu Kyi, a state counselor and Nobel Peace Prize laureate, along with President Win Myint, had been 'detained' in the capital Naypyidaw.

'We heard they were taken by the military,' he told AFP, adding that he was extremely worried about the pair. With the situation we see happening now, we have to assume that the military is staging a coup.'

The White House said President Biden had been briefed about the situation and called upon the Myanmar military to release the leaders.

'The United States opposes any attempt to alter the outcome of recent elections or impede Myanmar's democratic transition, and will take action against those responsible if these steps are not reversed,' the White House said in a statement.

British Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab added: 'The democratic wishes of the people of Myanmar must be respected, and the National Assembly peacefully re-convened.'

UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres 'strongly' condemned the military's detention of Suu Kyi, President Win Myint and other leaders.

'These developments represent a serious blow to democratic reforms in Myanmar,' spokesman Stephane Dujarric said in a statement.

'We request the release of stakeholders including state counsellor Aung San Suu Kyi who was detained today,' Japan's foreign ministry said in a statement urging 'the national army to quickly restore the democratic political system in Myanmar.'

'We call on the military to respect the rule of law, to resolve disputes through lawful mechanisms and to release immediately all civilian leaders and others who have been detained unlawfully,' Australian Foreign Minister Marise Payne added.

Singapore's Ministry of Foreign Affairs expressed 'grave concern about the latest situation in Myanmar,' adding hopes that all parties would 'exercise restraint.'

Indonesia's foreign minister likewise expressed 'concern' while also urging 'self-restraint.'

But Philippine presidential spokesman Harry Roque said the situation is an 'internal matter.'

'Our primary concern is the safety of our people, he said. 'Our armed forces are on standby in case we need to airlift them as well as navy ships to repatriate them if necessary.'

A military spokesman did not answer phone calls seeking comment.

An NLD lawmaker, who asked not to be named for fear of retaliation, said another of those detained was Han Thar Myint, a member of the party's central executive committee.

Elsewhere, the chief minister of Karen state and several other regional ministers were also held, according to party sources, on the very day when the new parliament was to hold its first session.

Myo Nyunt said it was not clear what would happen to the newly elected MPs.

General's daughter-turned freedom fighter Aung San Suu Kyi Aung San Suu Kyi was born under British rule in what was then Burma to General Aung San, one of the heroes of the country's fight for independence. General San was assassinated in 1948, while Ms Suu Kyi was just two years old and shortly before the country gained independence. In 1960 - two years before the country entered full dictatorship - she left her home country for India, where her mother had been appointed ambassador in Delhi. Four years later Ms Suu Kyi went to study philosophy, politics and economics at Oxford University where she met her future husband, British academic Michael Aris. Suu Kyi and her British husband Michael Aris are pictured with son Alexander in London in 1973 An historian who lectured on Bhutanese, Tibetan and Himalayan culture and history, Ms Suu Kyi married Aris in a Buddhist ceremony in 1972. Ms Suu Kyi spent some time after the wedding living and working in Japan and Bhutan, where Aris was private tutor to the monarch's children, before the couple settled in the UK to raise their own children - Alexander and Kim. In 1988, Ms Suu Kyi returned to her home country - at first to tend to her critically-ill mother, but soon became embroiled in pro-democracy protests after the country's military ruler General Ne Win stepped down. Placed under house arrest in 1989, the military held elections the following year which Ms Suu Kyi won - though they decided to ignore the result. She was kept under house arrest for the next six years, during which time she was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize, before being freed in 1995 - though kept under strict travel restrictions and bans on speaking to media. Ms Suu Kyi last saw her husband that same year, before he died from prostate cancer in Oxford in 1999. Over the next decade she continued to press for democratic reform of Myanmar while spending time in and out of house arrest - and was locked up during the country's first elections in 2010. In 2012 she won a seat as an MP and was sworn in as leader of the opposition. Her party won power in 2015, and while she became defacto leader of the country she was banned from the official role because her children are British. Advertisement

Myanmar's commander-in-chief and new leader, General Min Aung Hlaing General Min Aung Hlaing, commander-in-chief of Myanmar's military, is now the country's leader after being handed control of the government using powers embedded in the constitution. Born in 1956 in then-Burma as the son of a civil engineer, Hlaing studied law at the Rangoon Arts and Science University - where classmates remembered him as a reserved student with little interest in politics. While fellow students joined demonstrations, Hlaing made annual applications to join the premier military university, the Defence Services Academy (DSA), succeeding on his third attempt in 1974. General Min Aung Hlaing, who is now the country's ruler after a coup against the government According to a member of his DSA class he was an average cadet. 'He was promoted regularly and slowly,' said the classmate, adding that he had been surprised to see Hlaing rise beyond the officer corps' middle ranks. In fact, Hlaing took over the running of the military in 2011 as Myanmar's transition to democracy began. By the onset of Suu Kyi's first term in 2016, he had transformed himself from a soldier into a politician - using a popular Facebook page to promote his activities and meetings with dignitaries. Hlaing studied other political transitions, diplomats and observers said, and has made much of the need to avoid the chaos seen in Libya and other Middle Eastern countries after regime change in 2011. Hlaing extended his term at the helm of the military for another five years in February 2016, a step that surprised observers who expected him to step aside that year during a regular army leadership reshuffle. He has been opposed to reforming the country's constitution which handed the military a 25 per cent share of seats and bars Suu Kyi from holding power directly. He was also one of the military leaders sanctioned in 2019 for a crackdown on Rohingya Muslims that was widely condemned as genocide. Hlaing was facing forced retirement from the military this year and had been eyeing up a career in politics as a way to remain in power, analysts said, and may have now concluded that a coup is his only chance to hang on.

A decade after junta's end, Myanmar military back in charge The man installed by army leaders as Myanmar's president after Monday's military coup is best known abroad for his role in the crackdown on 2007 pro-democracy protests and for his ties to still powerful military leaders. Myint Swe was the army-appointed vice president when he was named on Monday to take over after the military arrested civilian leader Aung San Suu Kyi and other leaders of her party. Immediately after he was named president, Myint Swe handed power to the country's top military commander, Senior Gen. Min Aung Hlaing. Under Myanmar's 2008 constitution, in cases of national emergency the president can hand power to the military commander in chief. That is one of many ways the military is assured of keeping ultimate control of the country. Min Aung Hliang, 64, has been commander of the armed forces since 2011 and is due to retire soon. That would clear the way for him to take a civilian leadership role if the junta holds elections in a year's time as promised. The military-backed Union Solidarity and Development Party's humiliating loss in last November's elections would likely have precluded that. The military justified the coup by saying the government failed to address claims of election fraud. 'It seems there's been the realization that Min Aung Hlaing's retirement is coming and he expected to move into a senior role,' said Gerard McCarthy, a postdoctoral fellow at the Asia Research Institute. 'The fact that the USDP couldn't deliver that sparked a realization that the system itself isn't designed to create the outcomes that they expected.' The U.S. government in 2019 put Min Aung Hlaing on a blacklist on grounds of engaging in 'serious human rights abuse' for leading army troops in security operations in Myanmar's northwestern Rakhine region. International human rights investigators say the military conducted what amounted to ethnic cleansing operations that prompted some 700,000 members of the Rohingya minority to flee, burning people out of their homes and committing other atrocities. In 2017, Myint Swe led an investigation that denied such allegations, saying the military acted 'lawfully.' In 2019, the U.S. Treasury Department froze Min Aung Hliang's U.S.-based assets and banned doing business with him and three other Myanmar military leaders. Earlier, it banned him from visiting the United States. Min Aung Hlaing also was among more than a dozen Myanmar officials removed from Facebook in 2018. His Twitter account also was closed. Myint Swe, now elevated to president, formerly was among military leaders included in an earlier Treasury Department list of sanctioned Myanmar officials and business figures. That designation was removed in 2016 as the U.S. government sought to support the country's economic development after nearly a half decade of reforms. Myint Swe, 69, is a close ally of former junta leader Than Shwe, who stepped down to allow the transition to a quasi-civilian government beginning in 2011. That eventually allowed Myanmar to escape the international sanctions that had isolated the regime for years, hindering foreign investment. It also enabled Myanmar's leaders to counterbalance Chinese influence with support from other governments. But with the coup, Beijing may well end up with still more sway over the country's economy. Myint Swe is a former chief minister of Yangon, Myanmar's biggest city, and for years headed its regional military command. During the 2007 monk-led popular protests known internationally as the Saffron Revolution, he took charge of restoring order in Yangon after weeks of unrest in a crackdown that killed dozens of people. Hundreds were arrested. Though he has not had a very high international profile, Myint Swe has played a key role in the military and politics. In 2002, he participated in the arrest of family members of former dictator Ne Win, Myanmar media reports say. Myint Swe arrested former General Khin Nyunt at Yangon Airport during the 2004 purge of the former prime minister and his supporters. Soon afterward, Myint Swe assumed command of the former military regime's sprawling military intelligence apparatus. Advertisement

The developments triggered a quick response from Australia, which warned the military is 'once again seeking to seize control' of the country.

'We call on the military to respect the rule of law, to resolve disputes through lawful mechanisms and to release immediately all civilian leaders and others who have been detained unlawfully,' Foreign Minister Marise Payne said.

In the hours after the arrests, communications networks in Myanmar were restricted, with several mobile phone networks down.

NetBlocks, a non-governmental organisation that tracks internet shutdowns, reported severe disruptions to web connections in Myanmar.

Phone numbers in the capital Naypyidaw were also seemingly unreachable.

Myanmar's polls in November were only the second democratic elections the country has seen since it emerged from the 49-year grip of military rule in 2011.

The NLD swept the polls, winning more than 80 percent of the vote and increasing its support from 2015 - and was expecting to renew the 75-year-old Suu Kyi's lease on power with a new five-year term.

But the military has for weeks complained the polls were riddled with irregularities, and claimed to have uncovered over 10 million instances of voter fraud.

It has demanded the government-run election commission release voter lists for cross-checking - which the commission has not done.

Last week, the military chief General Min Aung Hlaing - arguably the country's most powerful individual - said the country's 2008 constitution could be 'revoked' under certain circumstances.

Min Aung Hlaing's remarks, which came with rumours of a coup already rife, raised tensions further within the country and drew a warning from more than a dozen foreign embassies and the UN.

Myanmar has seen two previous coups since independence from Britain in 1948, one in 1962 and one in 1988.

Suu Kyi - a former democracy icon and Nobel peace prize winner whose image internationally has been in tatters over her handling of the Muslim Rohingya crisis - remains a deeply popular figure.

About 750,000 Rohingya were forced to flee into neighbouring Bangladesh during the campaign, which UN investigators said amounted to genocide.

Suu Kyi was only ever de facto leader of Myanmar as the military had inserted a clause in the constitution that barred her from being president.

She spent 20 years off and on under house arrest for her role as an opposition leader, before she was released by the military in 2010.

The 2008 constitution also ensured the military would remain a significant force in government by retaining control of the interior, border and defence ministries.

But to circumvent the clause preventing her from being president, Suu Kyi assumed leadership of the country via a new role of 'state counsellor'.

'From (the military's) perspective, it has lost significant control over the political process,' political analyst Soe Myint Aung told AFP.

The new parliament is due to meet on Monday for the first time since the November election, which was won in a landslide by Suu Kyi's party, but which the military says was marred by fraud.

A group of Western powers including the United States issued a joint statement on Friday warning against 'any attempt to alter the outcome of the elections or impede Myanmar's democratic transition'.

In a statement on Sunday, the military accused the foreign diplomats of making 'unwarranted assumptions'.

The military 'will do everything possible to adhere to the democratic norms of free and fair elections, as set out by the 2008 Constitution, lasting peace, and inclusive well-being and prosperity for the people of Myanmar,' it said in the statement, posted on Facebook.

Tanks were deployed in some streets last week and pro-military demonstrations have taken place in some cities ahead of the first gathering of parliament.

The army said on Tuesday it would 'take action' against the election result, and when asked if it was planning a coup, a spokesman declined to rule it out.

The statement on Sunday did not directly address the issue of such action or of a coup.

Videos on social media showed violence and supporters throwing tables and chairs at Hirt Steakhouse, a restaurant in the centre of Gelsenkirchen, with hundreds of riot police descending on the scene.

Local police later confirmed that the incident involved Serbian and England fans and that seven arrests were made, of which all were Serbian nationals.

Serbian fans initially claimed they were attacked by England fans while they were in the restaurant, with one telling Mail Sport that they were attacked by 'English hooligans.'

Mail Sport has also been told by Gelsenkirchen officials that the majority of England fans have been relaxed and enjoyed the occasion.

Shocking pictures show supporters covered in blood after violence broke out ahead of England's first Group C game against Serbia, which kicks off in Gelsenkirchen at 8pm.

German riot police quickly descended on the scene this afternoon as football hooliganism made a shameful return to the Euros, with police sources telling MailOnline at least six people have been arrested.

There was speculation over which supporters were involved in the vicious brawls, with reports initially suggesting the violence was sparked by Serbia's arch-rivals Albania attacking Serbs.

However, Gelsenkirchen police have now said it was English and Serbian fans who were involved in the fighting.

'It was an altercation between English and Serbian fans, who were separated by the police,' a spokesman said. 'Further measures are underway and the background is currently being clarified.'

Officers moved in after trouble erupted between fans outside a restaurant-bar just after 3.30pm. Video shows a group of thugs - some hooded and masked - launching bottles, chairs and tables - while some supporters were seen fleeing the area for safety as tension boiled over.

One English fan is believed to have suffered a head wound in the fracas, with one other injured.

Earlier, the UK's dedicated Football Policing Unit released a statement saying a 'number of arrests' have been made, but it is believed those detained are Serbian.

Witnesses reported a 'masked' group of men suddenly burst around a corner and began throwing bottles.

Witnesses reported a 'masked' group of men suddenly burst around a corner and began throwing bottles.

An eyewitness told MailOnline: 'There was a sudden burst of violence. It came out of nowhere.

'It was unclear who started what. But to me it seemed liked a group of fans rushed the bar where Serbs were drinking and it all kicked off with tables, chairs and bottles thrown.

'One man had blood pouring from a head wound - he was English I believe.'

The violence marks a return to the ugly side of football not seen since fans stormed Wembley in 2021 for the final of the 2020 Euros - which were delayed due to Covid.

Football hooliganism has largely been on the decline since its heydays of the 1980s and 1990s - but violence can still break out.

In videos on social media, glass could be heard being smashed as police ran down a street in the centre of town.

One clip showed several dozen fans throwing restaurant chairs and tables at one another before one group fled with the other giving chase.

Police officers joined the chase and broke up altercations which left several fans with blood pouring from their faces.

One fan could be seen curled up on the ground, bring kicked by rivals before police intervened.

Riot police descended on the scene within minutes of the violence and forced those still in the vicinity inside the steakhouse. Officers then quickly surrounded the terraced property with police vans blocking each end of the street.

A spokesperson for the UK's Football Policing Unit said: 'We are aware of an issue in Gelsenkirchen ahead of the England v Serbia match.

'Our German colleagues have made a number of arrests of what we currently believe to be Serbian supporters.

'At this stage we do not believe that any UK nationals have been arrested but enquiries are ongoing.

'Our officers are at the location speaking to German colleagues.

'Our investigation team is now reviewing footage of the incident and if any UK nationals have been involved, football banning orders will be sought.'

An Englishman, who would only give his first name, Larry, and who had been drinking with the Serbs when the attack was launched, said a group of men in balaclavas 'ran around the corner and started throwing bottles.'

He added: 'I ran away and the next thing I saw was the tables being smashed and chairs being thrown'.

His friend, another Englishman living in Belgrade who did not want to be named, added: 'It was premeditated. They threw bottles, I just ran off.'

A mother and son enjoying their regular Sunday routine of coffee and cake at the Café Pabot opposite the Hirt Steakhouse said they were sat on the first floor when 'all of a sudden bits of food and bottles started being thrown.'

The son, Felix Wurmes, 35, added: 'It happened so fast. Then one group ran off, followed by the other.'

His mother, Beate Rafrlkski, 66, added: 'They have had too much beer I expect – there's too much emotion. We were anxious the trouble was going to spread to inside the café.'

Café worker Petra Thiel said another person who was in the café at the time told her she had heard the attackers shouting something in Serbian.

'In total, there were about 50 people involved', she added. 'I didn't see any masks'.

England fan Matthew Simpson had been socialising with the Serbian group moments before the trouble erupted. He said he was told the attackers had been Albanians.

There have been united calls for peace amid fears that hooligan clashes could overshadow the match - as Serbian thugs appeared to display online St George's cross flags 'stolen' from English travelling groups.

Football fans in Serbia have a track record of serious violence - with hooligan groups linked to organised crime groups accused of kidnap, rape and even murder.

Red Star Belgrade ultras, known as the Delije or 'Strong Boys', they are said to specialise in gang warfare, political violence, racketeering and organised crime.

The Balkan country's most notorious hooligan, Ivan Bogdanov, is a fearsome figure known as 'Ivan the Terrible' who has spent more than two years in Italian and Serbian jails.

An estimated 40,000 England supporters are believed to have descended this weekend on Gelsenkirchen and neighbouring cities such as Dusseldorf and Cologne.

But many faced issues reaching the stadium after a broken down train caused public transport delays.

Frustrated fans reported waiting more than half an hour for a train, while sports writer Oliver Kay described the situation as a 'total mess'.

He wrote on social media: 'For any England or Serbia fans who are still in the middle of Gelsenkirchen (or worse still not there yet), I’d recommend you set off on foot if you can. It’s about three miles but the public transport situation is a total mess.'

German police have been working with authorities from London and Belgrade to try to avoid ugly scenes in the areas around the stadium and during the game itself.

Tonight's game marks a return to Gelsenkirchen 18 years after Wayne Rooney saw red there as England crashed out of the World Cup yet again on penalties.

England manager Gareth Southgate has encouraged supporters to enjoy their time in Germany.

Yet local police have labelled tonight's game 'high risk' following reports earlier last week of Serbian ultras making their way to the region.

It would be the last time they ever saw each other.

Hours later, Mounia discovered her only son had been shot dead at point-blank range by a policeman during a traffic stop in what has been described as an 'execution' - the latest and perhaps most egregious example of police violence in France.

Now, Mounia is leading protests against the authorities amid widespread outcry at Nahel's death, which has prompted renewed speculation that France's police force is rife with racial discrimination.

Yesterday she guided a 6000-strong group of demonstrators on a march through the streets of Nanterre, holding flares and chanting 'Justice for Nahel'.

It came after she shared a tearful video on social media, lashing out at the officer who shot her son dead.

'He gave me a big kiss and told me he loved me, I told him to be careful, we left the house at the same time and went to McDonalds, then I went to work like everyone.

'He was everything to me, and that son of a b***h shot him,' Mounia said. 'I only had one, he was my best friend, my son, we were so close.'

France is now facing a third full day of bitter clashes between the country's youth and riot police, after the past three nights saw hordes of protesters setting cars alight, attacking municipal buildings and chanting for justice.

Mounia later told France 5 that she holds the shooter responsible, not the police force.

'I don't blame the police, I blame a person: the one who took my son's life.

'I have police friends, they are wholeheartedly with me. They do not agree with what he did,' she said.

'He didn't have to kill my son, there were other ways of doing it. A bullet? So close to his chest? No... there are other ways of doing it. get them out (of the vehicle, editor's note). Killing little ones like that… How long will it last? How many more children will die?'

The offending officer, who has not been identified, was taken into custody pending further investigation.

Mounia's march, in which she led a stream of 6,000 protesters wearing white t-shirts with 'Justice for Nahel' emblazoned across them, was initially peaceful.

But as the march progressed, youths began to light fires and threw projectiles at the hundreds of riot police in the area.

Within minutes, large clouds of thick black smoke were seen trailing into the air, mixing with tear gas fired by the officers.

The demonstration came as President Emmanuel Macron convened a crisis meeting with police chiefs and senior minister, at which it was agreed to put an extra 40000 police on the streets.

Macron described the killing of Nahel as 'inexcusable', but he and his government ministers have condemned the protest as 'damaging to the Republic'.

French Prime Minister Elisabeth Borne today said that the government was considering 'all options' to restore order after widespread unrest and violence, including the declaration of a state of emergency.

This would give local authorities increased powers to declare localised curfews, ban demonstrations, and give police more freedom in restraining suspected rioters and searching homes.

Asked by reporters if a state of emergency was being considered, as some right-wing opposition parties have demanded, she replied: 'I won't tell you now, but we are looking at all options, with one priority: restoring order throughout the country.'

During the last nationwide urban riots in 2005, the then right-wing government declared a state of emergency after around two weeks of clashes.

In light of his death, the United Nations declared that France must address deep issues of racial discrimination in its police after a third night of unrest rocked France's streets.

'We are concerned by the killing of a 17-year-old of North African descent by police in France on Tuesday,' UN human rights office spokeswoman Ravina Shamdasani told a media briefing in Geneva.

'We note that an investigation has been launched into alleged voluntary homicide.

'This is a moment for the country to seriously address the deep issues of racism and discrimination in law enforcement.'

Police sources said that rather than pitched battles between protesters and police, Thursday night was marked by pillaging of shops, reportedly including flagship branches of Nike and Zara in Paris.

Public buildings were also targeted, with a police station in the Pyrenees city of Pau hit with a Molotov cocktail, according to regional authorities, and an elementary school and a district office set on fire in northern town Lille.

A transgender person wanted for exposing their naked, half-erect penis to women in two separate changing room incidents in Los Angeles has spoken out about the incident before their arrest earlier this month having been on the run since September 2021.

The suspect, 53-year-old Darren Agee Merager, had been charged with five felony counts of indecent exposure for the incidents - including an infamous altercation at Wi Spa, where Merager exposed herself to several women, including an underage girl.

Merager - a convicted sex criminal who identifies as a woman - had previously rebuffed the allegations, claiming to be a victim of transphobia.

The incident spawned month protests - many of them violent - all while Merager's previous sex crimes continued to come to light. Eventually, Merager was unmasked as a registered sex offender, convicted for similar incidents in 2002 and 2003.

Speaking to LA Mag before their arrest earlier in December, Merager said he was surprised by the extent of the protests that took place.

'I was completely caught off guard by that. I live my own personal private life. I try to stay aware of the community, but I'm very much a person that doesn't belong to any type of organization. Even put me under a transgender umbrella, and I'm very uncomfortable. But when they had that second protest, I wanted to really understand why people were protesting. I actually went down there just to witness it.'

Merager also said that being on the run has also affected people associated with him.

'Being on the lam doesn’t only affect me. Back when this thing first started, I sold my car to my doctor, and then the police followed this car, dragged my doctor’s elderly father from behind the wheel, with the helicopters and news cameras on him, and held him there handcuffed for hours. He’s clearly an elderly Korean man. I’m a white guy with long, blond hair! So people close to me have also been affected.'

During a look into Merager's background, a warrant was also unearthed for the sex pest's arrest for a separate locker room incident in December 2018 together with a laundry list of offenses stretching nearly two decades, including burglary and trespass.

The incident sparked months of sometimes violent protests, where members of the radical leftist group Antifa showed up - masked and in riot gear - to violently defend the suspect's claims.

The story was then, for months, swept under the rug by the mainstream media - with many, including the leftist radical group Antifa, defending Merager.

Back in June, a group of women complained that Merager used his status as a transgender woman to expose her particularly erect penis at the Wi Spa in Los Angeles to them—with at least one of them being an underage girl

The suspect had been charged with five felony counts of indecent exposure for the incidents - including an infamous altercation at Wi Spa, where she exposed herself to several women, including an underage girl. She was also wanted for indecent exposure in a separate incident in 2018 that transpired at a changing area at a swimming pool in West Hollywood Park

Earlier this month, more than year after going on the lam in September 2021 - three months after the Wi Spa incident - Merager was booked by LA police for the spa and pool incidents, with a bail set at $350,000.

A biological male, Merager - who said he would fight his case in court before suddenly going on the run in September 2021 - faces 11 charges in total for the pair of incidents, where she allegedly used her status as a transgender woman to access women's changing areas and show his partially erect penis to those inside.

Jeremy Lee Quinn, pictured, of LA Mag got to speak with Merager over the course of several months prior to his arrest

When asked by LA Mag why he decided to flee, Meager said he could not have afforded the bail.

'I couldn't bail out. They were going to put my bail to the point where it's just through the roof. I mean, it could be close to a million dollars. There's no way I'd ever be able to get out. That's not turning yourself in. I said, ""I'm not going to just be kidnapped. Enough is enough.""'

Merager's apparent ruse first made headlines in June, when a female patron at Wi Spa posted a video to social media that showed her complaining to staff a man had exposed his penis to her and others - including a young girl - in the women's section.

'It's okay for a man to go into the women's section, show his penis around the other women, young little girls — underage — in your spa?' the frustrated woman, who is reportedly being treated as one of the victims in the case, can be heard asking staff in the clip.

'He's a man! He is a man!' The three-and-a-half-minute video was promptly reposted across social media and soon went viral - forcing Wi Spa to address the incident, with staffers saying they stood behind Merager and her alleged gender identity.

When asked why Merager simply didn't use a stall in order to avoid such confrontations, they appeared defiant.

'It’s not for me to adapt to society at this point. Even if it’s the polite thing to do or you want me to or there’s a controversy or whatever, if nobody else is using a shower curtain or nobody else is using a swimsuit, it’s illegal to try and make me do it. Technically, and from all perspectives, I am female, and everybody agrees with that. We’re all on equal grounds under the law.'

Amid this unrest generated by the protests, several media outlets labeled the outcry as merely bias against transgender people, with some going as far to report the incident - which transpired on June 23, 2021 - flat-out didn't happen. Slate, for instance, labeled the story a 'transphobic hoax.'

However, as attention around the incident swirled, LA police became aware of the controversy, and thus, Merager. They soon discerned that she was wanted for another indecent exposure incident - also involving women and children - at women's changing area at a swimming pool in West Hollywood Park.

The alleged altercation, according to police, was eerily similar to the occurrence at the spa, and saw Merager labeled a fugitive from the law after she failed to address the indecent exposure charges leveled against her after the incident - of which there were six.

Speaking to LAMag, Merager appeared to brush aside any issues of indecent exposure.

'One step away from Santa Monica Boulevard, where there are rainbows and guys sitting in windows with rubber balls sticking in their mouths. You bring your kids over here, and you’re afraid they’re seeing a transgender person?' he questioned.

Last Tuesday, more than year after going on the lam in September 2021 - three months after the Wi Spa incident - Merager was booked by LA police for the spa and pool incidents, with a bail set at $350,000. She remained incarcerated Monday

A biological male, Merager - pictured here in 2020 - faces 11 charges in total for the pair of incidents, where she allegedly used her status as a transgender woman to access women's changing areas and show his partially erect penis to those inside

An internal flyer sent out by the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department at the time read: 'Merager claims to identify as female so he can access women's locker rooms and showers.'

It further noted her status as a 'registered sex offender,' while specifying the make of Merager's car as well as her 2018 booking photo.

As protests and general unrest surrounding the Wi Spa incident continued, police quietly filed five more charges against the already wanted Merager, following a three-month investigation into the claims by the Los Angeles Police Department.

Shortly thereafter - despite telling the New York Post in an interview that she was aware of the warrant for her arrest and had been in contact with the Los Angeles County District Attorney's Office with plans to turn herself in - Merager disappeared, only to be found and booked by LA police earlier this month.

It was not immediately clear where Merager was apprehended, though it was somewhere in the Golden State, arrest records show.

The arrest likely offers some semblance of validation for those who questioned Merager's claims and the blind support she subsequently received, as her story spawned national attention and divided a city and even the nation as a whole.

The incident led to months of protests—some of them violent—as progressives clashed on their interpretations of the strange alleged occurrence

The story was then, for months, swept under the rug by the mainstream media, with many, including the leftist radical group Antifa, taking to the streets to attack protesters questioning Merager

Merager's first court appearance is slated for December 30, where she will address the 11 indecent exposure charges leveled against her.

Neighbors, associates and court records for Merager, who was born a male, paint a picture of a troubled and lawless transient, who avoids their parents' conservative Riverside neighborhood and has a history of exposing themselves in women's locker rooms.

Their extensive criminal history includes three burglaries, two convictions for indecent exposure in 2002 and 2003, a third exposure case that Merager is still contesting, failure to register as a sex offender, unlawful carrying of a switchblade, three trespassing convictions, two guilty verdicts of loitering with intent to commit a crime, resisting arrest, reckless driving, driving without a license, unlawful taking of another's vehicle without permission, and giving false identification to a police officer.

Already a registered sex offender, Merager is facing felony charges for indecent exposure in a locker room at Wi Spa in LA and another incident at a Hollywood pool changing room in 2018 - both allegedly involving minors

Merager, whose last known address is listed as her parents' home (pictured), was already a registered sex offender - with a track record extending back two decades - when the Wi Spa and pool incidents occurred

Merager was convicted of two burglaries in 2011 and 2012.

In one of the cases they were prosecuted alongside multiple alleged accomplices.

In 2000, Merager was convicted of trespassing as well as loitering with intent in two separate cases. They were convicted of trespassing again in 2001.

In 2002 and 2003 they were convicted of indecent exposure, then for failing to register as a sex offender in 2006.

Merager did not appear in a search of the Megan's Law database, a list of registered sex offenders in California, or in the similar national federal database.

Merager began 2007 with a conviction for resisting arrest, then was convicted that year for providing a false ID to a police officer.

But serial criminal claimed in a recent civil court case that they have been physically attacked for their lifestyle and behavior. In a civil complaint filed in a Los Angeles court in April this year, Merager alleged they were parked on a public street outside a home in Malibu when the homeowner shoved them down a steep bank.

Merager claimed Mark Falvai 'demanded to know why Plaintiff had parked a car in front of the Premises' then 'approached Plaintiff and completely unprovoked used two hands to push Plaintiff in Plaintiff's chest.'

'Defendant Falvai's use of physical force caused Plaintiff to tumble down a steep embankment between the roadway and the Premises causing physical injury to Plaintiff,' the court complaint said.

'Plaintiff was able to climb the embankment and escape to safety inside his locked car.'

The court papers claimed Merager called police who arrested Falvai. The case settled out of court in August last year.

The blonde, blue-eyed Merager, who stands at 6'2' and weighs 200lbs according to LAPD records, had bounced around Los Angeles county for years before making headlines with the Wi Spa incident, frequenting locales such Marina Del Rey, Malibu and Pasadena.

Residency records show her most recent address in April last year in Sun City, Riverside, the home of her 77-year-old mother, Brenda.

Brenda and her partner declined to comment when approached by DailyMail.com, but residents of their middle class neighborhood said they had not ever seen Merager at the home - located in a predominantly conservative enclave in the otherwise progressive region.",Registered sex-offender identifying as woman arrested for 'exposing erect penis to young girl',1
https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/article/2024/may/19/pro-palestine-protesters-vow-to-rally-as-la-trobe-joins-universities-enforcing-encampment-ban,1,"Pro-Palestine students and staff at La Trobe University have called the university’s directive to end their sit-in an “attack on free speech”, and vowed to rally against the encampment crackdown until management meets their demands.

La Trobe University on Friday followed Deakin University in issuing a formal directive for protesters to end their encampment on the Bundoora campus, amid a wave of student pro-Palestine sit-ins across the nation.

Monash University on Friday said the student encampment on its Clayton campus, in Melbourne’s south-east, had ended, and the University of Queensland has signalled its aims for its pro-Palestine camps to end.

On Wednesday, the Australian National University (ANU) requested a group of pro-Palestine students disband their on-campus encampments or risk breaching the university’s code of conduct.

La Trobe University said it would continue to accommodate the right of students and staff to protest without an encampment. But in a statement on Saturday, the Students for Palestine La Trobe group said the university was “attempting to crush pro-Palestine encampments.”

At the University of Melbourne, a group of student activists have spent four nights camped inside the Arts West building, as administrators and protesters organisers remain in a deadlock over the sit-in.

Despite the University of Melbourne threatening police intervention, Guardian Australia understands administrators have not made a formal report of trespassing – which would be the trigger for police action.

The students have renamed the Arts West building Mahmoud Hall – in honour of a Palestinian student Mahmoud who they say intended to study at the university but was killed in Gaza last year.

Dana Alshaer, from the University of Melbourne for Palestine group, said on Friday the protesters had attempted to have an “open dialogue” but the university’s executives had not met their key demands.

Alshaer said it would be the “university’s decision” if they wanted to replicate the scenes where US police in riot gear stormed Columbia University to break up a pro-Palestine encampment.

In a statement on Friday, the university said it was “deeply concerned by this occupation” and warned that police “may choose to attend campus at any time”.

“This occupation presents a significant safety risk to our students and staff members, and has resulted in damage to university property,” the spokesperson said.

The spokesperson said since Wednesday more than 8,300 students had been affected by the disruption and 247 classes rescheduled.

On Friday, Deakin Students for Palestine said an on-campus encampment would hold a “closing rally” next Wednesday, after defying a second request to disband. It vowed further protests next semester.

A spokesperson for Monash University said its encampment organisers notified the university on Friday that they “planned to pack up”.

They said the university would “continue to work with our student and community leaders, and with staff, to ensure safety and security on campus and, importantly, to meet the academic and pastoral needs of our staff and students”.

But the Students for Palestine Monash group said after nine student protesters were banned from the camp, the university’s security “forcibly dismantled” the site.

The group said a protest rally was planned for Tuesday at the Clayton campus.

“We are not going to stop protesting for Palestine,” they told Guardian Australia.

The National Tertiary Education Union (NTEU)‘s Monash branch upheld a motion on Saturday condemning management’s use of student misconduct regulations against the Monash protesters and demanding they be dropped.

In a statement, it said the encampment was a “non-violent and peaceful” form of protest and members were “deeply concerned” students were being targeted.

“This action raises important questions about whether Monash University is committed to protecting freedom of speech,” they said. “The right of staff and students to express political views is critical to the mission and function of universities.”

The University of Queensland’s chancellor, Peter Varghese, on Friday said it “cannot allow the encampments to continue indefinitely” on its grounds.

Its vice-chancellor, Prof Deborah Terry, said the “objective is to discontinue the camps as soon as possible” and the university was “continuing to engage with nominated protest representatives, to agree a peaceful resolution to the current camp arrangements”.",Pro-Palestine protesters vow to rally as La Trobe joins universities enforcing encampment ban,1
https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14207221/criminals-donald-trump-pardon-second-presidency.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490,1,"Donald Trump is mulling pardons for some of his top MAGA allies and fiercest defenders once he is sworn into office.

And he could even pardon himself in the two federal cases against him.

President Joe Biden announced a pardon for troubled son Hunter, 54, over felony gun and tax charges, setting a new precedent for the sweeping pardon power.

And he also commuted the sentences of roughly 1,500 people earlier this month and handed out 39 pardons. It was the largest single-day act of clemency in modern history.

On Monday, he was criticized for commuting the death sentences of 37 out of 40 federal death row inmates.

Now, Democrats are increasingly concerned that Trump will use Biden's sweeping pardons as an excuse to use the powers more liberally in his second term.

Trump suggested immediately after Hunter's pardon that he would seek the same leniency for jailed Capitol rioters - and later confirmed it as a priority to free them.

This raises the question of who else might be on Trump's list to receive a pardon.

Some speculate that he could use the powers to issue pardons for his own children. Others think that he could use it for himself and his top allies.

Here is a look at which notorious criminals Trump could move to pardon in his next four years.

January 6 prisoners

Trump said on his first day back at the White House, he plans to issue pardons for all January 6 defendants whose actions were meant to show displeasure with the results and running of the 2020 presidential elections.

The promise from Trump means at least 500 people could see their prison sentences ended on the very first day of his second term.

The president-elect said it's a high priority for him to get those who rioted at the Capitol in 2021 out of where they are being held because they have been there for years while he ran for a second term.

'I'm going to be acting very quickly,' Trump told NBC News in his first post-victory interview aired December 8 on Meet the Press. 'I'm looking first day.'

'These people have been there, how long is it? Three, four years,' Trump lamented.

'They've been in there for years. And they're in a filthy, disgusting place that shouldn't even be allowed to be open,' he added.

The mass pardons could see more than 500 people released from prisons and another nearly 1,000 cases dismissed.

After the Hunter pardon, Trump immediately suggested he would pardon all January 6 rioters who received prison sentences. He later confirmed the pardons are a day one priority

As of August, 944 defendants had their cases adjudicated and received sentences for their activity on January 6, 2021, according to the Justice Department.

And 562 of those were sentenced to incarceration of varying periods.

More than 1,488 defendants were charged in nearly all 50 states and the District of Columbia in both District and Superior Court.

The DOJ claimed in August that nearly 900 people pleaded guilty to federal crimes and will face incarceration at sentencing, if they haven't already.

Of the 894 pleas, 288 were felonies and 606 misdemeanors.

Many of the charges were related to assaulting law enforcement officers or obstructing, impeding or interfering with law enforcement officers during civil disorder.

At least 180 of those charged with those crimes have been sentenced to prison terms up to 151 months – or nearly 12-and-a-half years.

Himself and his kids

Article II, Section 2, of the U.S. Constitution says pardon power allows a president to 'grant reprieves and pardons for offenses against the United States, except in cases of impeachment.'

There is no language specifying who can or can not receive the pardon.

Since the president is given the power to pardon any federal crime, it appears there is nothing to prevent Trump from adding his own name to the list.

'It is an open question whether a President can pardon himself,' legal scholar John Yoo told Daily Mail. 'The President's power to pardon has very few limits — he cannot pardon for impeachment and he cannot pardon for state crimes.'

'Other than that, there are no limits on the President's ability to pardon for federal crimes,' added the Deputy Assistant Attorney General for the Office of Legal Counsel under President George W. Bush. 'I think this means that the Constitution allows a President to pardon even himself.'

'The Federalist supporters of the Constitution [felt[ it was more important to give the President as much flexibility in the pardon power as possible,' Yoo, who worked in President George W. Bush's administration, noted.

After President Joe Biden earlier this month pardoned his son Hunter, 54, from felony convictions for lying on a form to purchase a firearm, Trump could seek to do the same for his own children for their involvement in federal lawsuits.

Trump's business empire The Trump Organization already faced conviction for a tax fraud scheme in New York.

And with Eric Trump now as executive vice president, any federal cases involving the business could fall on his middle son.

Trump is also facing a slew of other lawsuits and has been convicted in some, including the E. Jean Carroll case where a jury found in May 2023 that Trump was liable for sexually abusing and defaming her. He was ordered to pay $5 million in damages.

It's possible he could seek to pardon himself in these federal cases.

Yoo suggested that Trump consider pardoning anyone who gave him legal advice in relation to his challenge of the electoral count in the 2020 election.

Specifically, he told Daily Mail that the president-elect might consider pardons for attorneys John Eastman and Rudy Giuliani.

“[T]hey committed no violence and as lawyers they were within their rights to explore a variety of legal scenarios for President Trump,” Yoo noted.

Trump has not riled out a pardon for New York City Mayor Eric Adams after he was indicted in September on fraud and bribery charges

Trump, speaking at the Libertarian National Convention in May, pledged that 'on Day One, I will commute the sentence of Ross Ulbricht' (pictured)

Trump has so far not ruled out issuing a pardon for Adams.

The Democratic Mayor was indicted in September on federal fraud and bribery charges.

But Trump said during his first post-election press conference on December 16 that Adams was 'treated very unfairly,' and suggested he was unfairly targeted because he is critical of the influx of migrants coming into the Big Apple.

Trump said from Palm Beach that he would 'have to see it, because I don't know the facts,' but claimed he is willing to pardon Adams.

The mayor was charged on allegations he received illegal donations from the Turkish government.

Trump joked that Adams was given free and discounted Turkish Airlines flights. He mocked the charges when he told reporters at the press conference that being upgraded on flights 'would mean you'd spend the rest of your life in prison.'

Adams recently said he would consider becoming a Republican.

Ross Ulbricht

A highly followed 'Free Ross' account in X posted after Trump won the 2024 election that the president-elect vowed to pardon Ulbricht.

'ROSS IS COMING HOME IN JANUARY!!' the account wrote in a statement from the 'Ulbricht family.'

'We are so so grateful to Donald Trump for his pledge to #FreeRoss and to all those who have supported us,' it added. 'Here's to this 12th Thanksgiving in prison being the last one!

Ulbricht was sentenced in 2015 to life in prison for creating and operating the dark web marketplace called Silk Road.

Trump, speaking at the Libertarian National Convention in May, pledged that 'on Day One, I will commute the sentence of Ross Ulbricht.'

Commutation is different from a pardon. The former would reduce the sentence while the latter does that but also absolves an individual of the guilt.

A commutation allows for the release of a convicted person while maintaining the verdict that caused the sentence.

Peter Navarro

The future Senior Counselor to the President served a four-month prison sentence earlier this year.

It was a sentence for contempt of Congress after Navarro defied a congressional subpoena in relation to the House January 6 Committee probe into the Capitol riot.

Trump left open the possibility of pardoning his former trade adviser.

He told reporters after voting in Florida on November 5 that Navarro is a 'good man' that was 'treated very unfairly.'

The president-elect also called Navarro a 'great patriot' when asked about a pardon.

But Navarro told the Wall Street Journal six months earlier in May that he would reject any pardon from Trump.

Instead Navarro wants to continue appealing his conviction.

'I will not give the Supreme Court any excuse to duck what is otherwise a landmark constitutional case,' he wrote in a letter sent from prison.

The day he was released from prison after his short sentence, Navarro flew to Milwaukee, Wisconsin to speak at the Republican National Convention.

Trump has also floated pardoning senior aide Peter Navarro, but the future senior counselor to the president said earlier this year he would reject a pardon because he wants to continue appealing his conviction

Julian Assange

During a May interview with podcaster Tim Pool, Trump said he would 'give very serious consideration' to a pardon for Assange.

The WikiLeaks founder fled the country more than a decade ago.

Assange struck a deal with the U.S. government in June to plead guilty to publishing military secrets in his infamous leak. This secured his freedom after 12 years in the United Kingdom.

Some of the time in the U.K. was spent in prison as he fought extradition to the U.S.

If Trump were to pardon Assange, it would wipe clean his felonies while also maintaining his newfound freedom.

Julian Assange struck a deal with the U.S. government in June to plead guilty to publishing military secrets in his infamous leak, which secured his freedom after 12 years in the United Kingdom. Trump could go one step further and wipe clean his slate

Derek Chauvin

A much more long shot possibility that Trump has not yet addressed publicly is a possible reevaluation of the case against former police officer Derek Chauvin.

In 2020, Chauvin became the first white police officer in Minnesota to be charged in the death of a black civilian – George Floyd.

The ensuing nationwide Black Lives Matter riots led to divide in the nation.

Most conservatives were on the side of law enforcement while progressives began calling for the defunding of police.

It's not clear if the next administration would even consider a pardon or commutation for Chauvin, but it does appear that the tide has turned recently.

Video was captured of Chauvin kneeling on Floyd's neck on May 25, 2020 during an arrest made with three other officers. He was dismissed by the Minneapolis Police Department on May 26 and arrested on May 29.

The death of Floyd at Chauvin's hands set off a series of protests that led to the Black Lives Matter riots.

Chauvin in early 2021 was put on jury trial for unintentional second-degree murder, third-degree murder, and second-degree manslaughter of Floyd. And on April 20 of that year he was convicted on all of the charges.

He was sentenced two months later to 22-and-a-half years in prison with credit given for 199 days time served. He was given the possibility of supervised release after 15 years.

Chauvin put in requests to the Minnesota Supreme Court and the Supreme Court of the United States for review, but they were denied.

A much more long shot possibility that Trump has not yet addressed publicly is a possible reevaluation of the case against former police officer Derek Chauvin

He also pleaded guilty in late 2021 to federal charges of violating Floyd's civil rights by using unreasonable force and in mid-2022 was sentenced to 21 years for that charge.

The Minnesota Department of Corrections lists Chauvin's anticipated release date on the state sentence as December 10, 2035, but for the federal charges it's likely he will be released around 2038.

Chauvin filed a motion in federal court in November last year attempting to vacate his guilty plea.

To serve out his sentence, Chauvin was transferred in August 2022 from Oak Park Heights Prison in Minnesota to FCI Tucson in Arizona, a medium-security federal facility.

He was stabbed by another inmate at the federal facility on November 24, 2023 and was transferred to FCI Big Spring in August this year.",How Donald Trump could pardon himself and MAGA 'criminals' in his second term,1
https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-10650699/Man-Gov-Whitmer-kidnap-plot-says-group-armed-ready.html,1,"A second insider-turned-government witness in the plot to kidnap Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer told jurors that the group was prepared to use a grenade launcher and machine gun to fight security officers at her vacation home.

Kaleb Franks, 27, who pleaded guilty in February, told the jury about how Barry Croft Jr., 46, 'discussed attacking her security detail.'

'He said he would use the grenade launcher that he had, and he was discussing mounting a machine gun on top of the truck,' Franks said Thursday in federal court in Grand Rapids.

Franks testimony came a day after fellow plotter and government witness Ty Garbin, 26, testified that Whitmer's kidnapping could serve as the 'ignition' for a US civil war involving antigovernment groups and possibly prevent the election of Joe Biden.

'We wanted to cause as much a disruption as possible to prevent Joe Biden from getting into office. It didn't have to be,' Garbin said of striking before the election. 'It was just preferred.'

Franks is expected back on the witness stand Friday for cross-examination in the government's case against Croft, Adam Fox, 38, Daniel Harris, 24, and Brandon Caserta, 33.

Along with Franks and Garbin, the four were arrested in October 2020, a month before the national election. Garbin took a plea deal in exchange for his testimony against the four on trial and was sentenced to six years.

Garbin took a plea deal, sentencing him to six yeas, in exchange for his testimony against the other men

Franks, a drug rehabilitation coach, said he joined a militia, the Wolverine Watchmen, to work on his gun skills. He eventually met Fox and Croft, who were not members of the militia, and found himself in the middle of a conspiracy.

Franks said he stuck with the group because he hoped he would be killed in a shootout with police during the kidnapping but kept it from others.

'I no longer wanted to live,' he said, moments after settling into the witness chair. 'A large portion of my family had died. I was struggling financially. Just wasn't happy.'

Franks also said an alleged leader, Fox, believed Whitmer's COVID-19 restrictions were 'tyrannical' and that the US Constitution gave the men a right to strike back. He said no one was forced to stick with the plan and many people had dropped away by late summer 2020.

'I was going to be an operator,' Franks replied when asked by a prosecutor to describe his role in a kidnapping. 'I would be one of the people on the front line, so to speak, using my gun.'

He said Fox talked about snatching the governor 'every time I saw him.'

Whitmer, a Democrat, rarely talks publicly about the case. She has blamed former President Donald Trump for fomenting anger over coronavirus restrictions and refusing to condemn right-wing extremists like those charged in the case

Brandon Caserta, 33, Barry Croft, 46, Adam Fox, 38, and Daniel Harris, 24, are on trial in plot to kidnap Whitmer

Garbin explained the Whitmer scheme to jurors, taking them through days of training, secret messages and a late night trip to her weekend home.

He talked about how he built a 'shoot house' with wood, tarps and scrap materials so the men could practice an eventual assault.

The goal was 'to kidnap the governor,' Garbin told a prosecutor.

'There was no question in your mind that everybody knew?' Assistant US Attorney Nils Kessler asked.

'No question,' Garbin said.

Defense lawyers claim the men were entrapped by the government. Garbin, however, told jurors that he never heard anyone talk about being swayed by informants.

He said he invited the group to his property in Luther, Michigan, to train for a violent assault on Whitmer's second home. He put together a crude structure so the men could practice going in and out of tight spaces.

'I was kind of ballparking it,' Garbin said of the layout. 'Every house had a front door. Every house had a living room. Every house had a hallway. Every house had a back door.'

In September 2020, Garbin, Fox, Croft and others traveled to Elk Rapids in three vehicles for night surveillance of Whitmer's property. Garbin said his job was to find it and flash a light to others at a boat launch.

He said his ultimate assignment would be to 'perform the actual kidnapping.'

Authorities said the men were armed extremists who, after weeks of training, were trying to come up with $4,000 for an explosive. They practiced that summer by dashing in and out of crude structures built to resemble a house or office.

Traveling at night, they scouted Whitmer's second home in Elk Rapids in September 2020 and inspected a bridge that could be blown up to frustrate any police response, according to trial testimony and conversations that were secretly recorded.

Defense attorneys are trying to show the jury that there was no credible plot, just a lot of profane, violent and crazy talk about Whitmer and other politicians trampling their rights during the COVID-19 pandemic. They also claim informants and undercover agents who infiltrated the group entrapped the men.

Garbin, an airplane mechanic, began cooperating with prosecutors soon after the group was arrested. He was rewarded with a relatively light six-year prison sentence, a term that could be reduced after the trial. Franks hasn't been sentenced yet but is also hoping for a break.

Whitmer, a Democrat, rarely talks publicly about the case, though she referred to 'surprises' during her term that seem like 'something out of fiction' when she filed for reelection on March 17.

https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/18/police-fire-teargas-as-gilets-jaunes-protests-return-to-paris,1,"French police fired teargas under a rain of projectiles, used stun grenades and arrested dozens of people on Saturday as thousands of “yellow vest” anti-government protesters returned to the streets of Paris.

Demonstrators shouted slogans denouncing the police, the president, Emmanuel Macron, and his pension reforms that have triggered the longest French transport strike in decades.

The previous night, Macron and his wife, Brigitte, had to be rushed from a Paris theatre after protesters tried to burst in and disrupt the performance.

With sirens wailing, riot police drove across the French capital in dozens of vans Saturday to the route where thousands of protesters marched.

The police said 59 people had been arrested by the early afternoon.

There were further allegations of police violence after video footage shot by AFPTV and others showed a young man, his face covered in blood, being arrested and beaten.

Young people wearing masks shouted “revolution” as teargas drifted by the Bastille, the square where the French revolution erupted in 1789.

“The street is ours,” some protesters chanted. “Macron, we’re going to come for you, in your home.”

Saturday’s clashes came on the 45th day of a strike that has hit train and metro traffic and caused misery for millions of commuters in and around Paris in particular. Trains are becoming more frequent, however, and Paris’s metro drivers voted to suspend their action from Monday, their union UNSA announced on Saturday.

The protests were also the latest of the weekly demonstrations held every Saturday by the gilet jaunes (yellow vest) movement since November 2018, and which have been boosted by those opposed to the pension reforms.

“We’re suffocating with this government who wants to put us on our knees,” said Annie Moukam, a 58-year-old teacher among the protesters. “It’s out of the question that he (Macron) touches our pensions. We have worked all our lives to be able to leave with a dignified retirement,” she added.

Macron’s reforms aim to forge a single pensions system from the country’s 42 separate regimes. The various systems currently in place offer early retirement and other benefits to some public-sector workers as well as lawyers, physical therapists and even Paris Opera employees.

Critics say the reforms will in effect force millions of people to work longer for a smaller pension.

The transport unions have joined forces with the yellow vests, who accuse Macron of ruling on behalf of an urban elite while ignoring people in the provinces and the countryside, many of whom struggle to make ends meet.

The unions are looking for a second wind as their movement begins to flag, with the proportion of striking workers at national railway operator SNCF falling to less than 5% on Friday.

The Louvre in Paris, the world’s most visited museum, reopened on Saturday after being shut down by workers opposed to the pension overhaul.

On Friday, hundreds of disappointed visitors massed outside the Louvre, some hurling insults at strikers who had blocked the entrance. It was the first time since the strike began on 5 December that the museum had shut completely, although it was forced to close some galleries last month.

But there was no sign of an end to the strike at the Paris Opera, which has lost €14m (£11.9m) with the cancellation of 67 performances.

The Paris Opera orchestra on Saturday gave renditions of Carmen and other works to Parisians and tourists on the steps of the Palais Garnier to show support for the strike. Under a stream of confetti, they finished with La Marseillaise, the national anthem. Supporters chanted “Long live the strike”.",Police fire teargas as gilets jaunes protests return to Paris,1

The Caucus of African American Leaders of Anne Arundel County in Maryland voted unanimously to call for the renaming and will lobby governor Wes Moore on the proposal, as reported by the Baltimore Banner.

The caucus includes civil rights groups such as the NAACP and the National Coalition of 100 Black Women.

Leaders argued that the The Star-Spangled Banner author -who the collapsed bridge was named after - was a slave owner who wrote lyrics that scholars have said 'demeaned black people.'

They have asked for the bridge to be renamed after late congressman Parren J Mitchel, the first black man from Maryland elected to the US House of Representatives.

Democratic gov Moore told Fox News he remains 'laser-focused on providing closure to these families, clearing the channel, and rebuilding the bridge.'

However, the Baltimore Banner reported that on Monday Moore told reporters there will 'be a time for that' conversation at a later date.

While as a lawyer Key helped many black Marylanders obtain their freedom before emancipation, he opposed the idea of free black citizens in the US, helping create the American Colonization Society, which promoted the emigration of black Americans to Africa.

Key is also often quoted as claiming that black Americans are 'a distinct and inferior race of people, which all experience proves to be the greatest evil that afflicts a community.'

However, the Star Spangled Banner Foundation has claimed the racist quote is 'Incorrectly credited to Key as a first-person expression of his attitudes about race in the United States.'

The foundation added: 'The quote is taken from page 40 of Jefferson Morley's generally insightful 2012 book Snow-Storm in August: Washington City, Francis Scott Key, and the Forgotten Race Riot of 1835).

The Caucus in Maryland has also asked that the the Senator Frederick Malkus Memorial Bridge be renamed after Maryland civil rights icon Gloria Richardson

'Morley, in turn, cites as his sole source a quote in the 1937 biography Francis Scott Key: Life and Times by Edward S. Delaplaine. This biography is the source of confusion as to the quote's speaker.'

Key is also believed to have regretted helping black Americans sue for their freedom, saying at one point it had 'produced for them nothing but evil.'

Engineers working to clear the wreckage of the collapsed Francis Scott Key Bridge in Baltimore said Thursday that they expect to be able to restore navigation in and out of the Port of Baltimore by the end of this month.

The bridge collapsed within seconds on March 26 after being struck by the cargo ship Dali, which lost power shortly after leaving Baltimore, bound for Sri Lanka. The ship issued a mayday alert with just enough time for police to stop traffic, but not enough to save a roadwork crew filling potholes on the bridge.

Authorities believe six workers plunged to their deaths in the Patapsco River; two bodies have been recovered so far. Two others survived.

The US Army Corps of Engineers announced a 'tentative timeline' Thursday, saying in a news release that it expects to open a limited access channel to the port within the next four weeks measuring some 280 feet wide by 35 feet deep.

The channel would support one-way traffic in and out of the port for barge container service and some vessels that move automobiles and farm equipment to and from the port.

The USACE said it is aiming to reopen the permanent, 700-foot-wide by 50-foot-deep federal navigation channel by the end of May, which would restore port access to normal capacity.

'A fully opened federal channel remains our primary goal, and we will carry out this work with care and precision, with safety as our chief priority,' Lt. Gen. Scott Spellmon, USACE commanding general said in the news release.

Spellmon acknowledged the timelines are 'ambitious' and may still be impacted by adverse weather or 'changes in the complexity of the wreckage.'",Civil rights groups call for collapsed Baltimore bridge to be renamed when it's rebuilt because legacy of national anthem author Francis Scott Key is 'clouded with racism accusations',1

Frustrated activists, furious with Daniel Andrew's Stage Four lockdown, turned out in their droves to demand the restrictions come to an end, with new coronavirus cases now in the double digits.

Shocking footage shows the horde of protesters, many refusing to wear masks and battling with police, as the city's CBD was brought to a standstill as traffic was diverted from the area.

Dramatic scenes saw demonstrators tackled to the ground while officers struggled to detain them.

The protests kicked off at the Shrine of Remembrance but coronavirus-deniers have since taken to the streets, stopping traffic near Albert Park.

One crowd faced off with police on horseback as the chant 'freedom' rang out across the city while 15 people were arrested and more than 150 fines given out.

Of those arrests, 14 were for breaching COVID-19 restrictions and one was for assaulting a police officer after a cop was hit round the head as the protests turned violent.

Meanwhile protests have erupted in Byron Bay with one onlooker telling Daily Mail Australia crowds were chanting 'free Victoria'.

Police later arrested the man and forced a face mask upon him, The Herald Sun reported.

Officers in riot gear have since descended onto the streets as the protest continues to make its way across the city.

In the lead up to the march, many of the anti-lockdown movement's most notorious members announced they would no longer attend and urged others to boycott the event.

James Bartolo was charged with incitement on Friday for allegedly encouraging his mass following to attend the rally.

Following his arrest, Bartolo announced he would not be at the march.

In Sydney mayhem unfolded as well with another group of protesters arrested.

Hundreds gathered at Hyde Park including boxing champ Anthony Mundine who said the killer disease is just a cover-up.

'I support people coming together and standing up against injustice. It's a dictatorship. A tyrannical reign,' he told The Sunday Telegraph.

'COVID is just a symptom of 5G radiation - it's a cover up.'

Three arrests were made at Hyde Park including a 44-year-old man and a 54-year-old for allegedly assaulting police and another woman for failing to comply with a move on notice.

Police also issued $1,000 fines to 18 people for ignoring COVID-19 restrictions.

One man, Sam Hansen, 26, who was also arrested in Sydney on Saturday, said he believed the virus wasn't real.

'I'm here because I believe in freedom. I don't like the lockdown laws. I think the entire COVID cyborg is a massive scam,' he said.

Other rallies kicked off at Sydney Olympic Park in Homebush with demonstrators singing the Australian national anthem.

The dramatic marches come just one day before Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews reveals the 'road map' plan for the state out of lockdown, which is due to end at 11.59pm on September 13.

Earlier leaked documents suggested the 8pm-5am curfew and tough restrictions on businesses would continue for another two weeks, with the economy already in a tatters after thousands were forced to close.

According to the leaked documents, residents could be given the luxury of two hours of exercise a day, which can be split into two sessions, from September 14 - the official date Stage Four comes to an end.

The report stated that from September 28, up to five people, including children, from up to two households will be allowed to meet outdoors for social interaction.

Permits will no longer be required for childcare and in-home childminding, according to the document.

Outdoor personal training would be allowed for up to two people per trainer and outdoor pools will open for exercise for up to 20 people at a time.

Officials have insisted the document is 'out of date', and that the new rules for coming out of lockdown will be announced on Sunday.

Meanwhile in northern NSW, protests have also spiralled out of control in Byron Bay.

Huge masses of residents armed with megaphones and signs took the streets of the popular beach town demanding 'freedom' and 'free choice'.

One barefooted man was dragged away by NSW police officers and thrown into a paddy wagon following the mass rally.

Others flashed signs and banners reading: 'Free choice for all, let us decide'.

One onlooker told Daily Mail Australia the crowds were chanting 'Free Victoria'.

'We were very confused, we were like 'why are people chanting 'free Victoria'?' the witness said.

'We assumed it was a Black Lives Matter protest until we read the signs.'

Premier Daniel Andrews has warned 'thousands' of Victorians would die if strict coronavirus restrictions were to be lifted.

Stage Four restrictions in Melbourne, and Stage Three in the rest of the state, are set to lift on September 13 after weeks of enduring the miserable lockdown.

But speaking on Saturday, a day ahead of his announcement on easing restrictions, Mr Andrews said lockdown was unlikely to end.

'To open up with those numbers would, of course, see the total number of coronavirus infections explode,' Mr Andrews said.

'It would see many, many hundreds, indeed thousands, of Victorians infected with this virus.

'So, as frustrating, as challenging as it is, we need to stay the course on this.

'That's why tomorrow we will outline a road map to ease these important restrictions, to ease out of the second wave, once it's appropriately and properly defeated. Truly defeated.'

Victoria recorded 76 new coronavirus cases and 11 deaths on Saturday, with the welcome infection numbers coming after a spike earlier in the week saw 113 new cases after days of double digit transmission.

Friday was Victoria's deadliest day of the pandemic so far, with 59 deaths announced - but 50 of those had occurred back in July and August in aged care homes.

The huge turn out came despite the rally's own organisers urging people not to go, saying the Andrews government would use it as an excuse to extend lockdown.

James Bartolo, who has been a face of the anti-lockdown campaign urged his mass following not to attend the protest.

Sharing a video on his personal Facebook page, the 27-year-old said Saturday's march was the 'worst possible thing' to do - believing it would prolong the lockdown.

'It is a set up from the get go. It is all just terrible. Don't go to that one,' he said.

'I say don't go because I am concerned about the safety of the brave men and women who plan to go. The police are not forcing me to say anything.'

Bartolo said that with the road map out of Stage Four restrictions to be revealed on Sunday, marches on Saturday would do more harm than good.

But Bartolo was singing a different tune in a video on Thursday night that was likely part of the reason he was arrested.

'I suggest if you're thinking of going or not going... just f**king go,' he said.

In the same video he gave protesters tips on how to conduct themselves on Saturday, including to avoid police and be compliant.

Bartolo claimed to not be involved in actually organising the protest, which he said was planned 'terribly' and following ones needed to be done a lot better.

A massive block party took place in West Kilburn yesterday afternoon before moving to Maida Vale where riot police with shields and truncheons battled hundreds of revellers who threw missiles at them.

It marked the third night of unrest after raves Brixton and Notting Hill which both turned violent and led to police injuries.

Many senior figures - including Home Secretary Priti Patel and former Met Police commissioner Lord Ian Blair - condemned the violence seen against police in recent weeks.

The Met have pledged to put around 1,000 riot-trained officers on standby and more than 80 police vans on the streets of London today ahead of predicted clashes this weekend.

A Section 60 order - giving police additional stop and search powers - was put in place last night but expired this morning.

Following unrest in Exmouth this week - including a mass brawl involving up to 200 people - Devon and Cornwall police have put together a dispersal notice to ensure those likely to cause trouble can be moved along.

In Cheshire, police have vowed to crack down on a planned rave in Knutsford this weekend while in Staffordshire, officers warned potential revellers to 'pause and think'.

A dispersal order remains in place in Liverpool after rowdy football fans set fire to the Liver Building as celebrations for Liverpool's league win went on for a second night.

Superintendent of Local Policing in Exeter, East and Mid-Devon, Antony Hart said: 'Over the past two days there have been a number of incidents of disorder and anti-social behaviour in the area of Exmouth sea front and Orcombe Point.

'These reports have included large groups of young people and adults fighting, a serious assault and officers being verbally abused and spat at. Needless to say, this is absolutely unacceptable behaviour and it will not be tolerated.

'As a result of these matters we will be putting out an increased high visibility police presence in the area over the coming days and those arriving can expect to be greeted by officers. Those who are involved in anti-social behaviour will be robustly dealt with, and we will seek out those who have committed offences.

'A Section 35 dispersal order has been put in place between 12pm on Friday 26 and 12pm on Sunday 28 June to cover the sea front area. Anyone who is formally given notice to disperse from the area must not return within the notice period and anyone who does is liable for arrest and prosecution.'

A Cheshire Police spokesperson said: 'There is information to suggest that a rave will be taking place within the Knutsford area this weekend. Numerous officers are out on patrol across the area checking in on hotspots.

'If you have any information as to where this is taking place please call us on 101.'

Staffordshire Police Chief Constable Gareth Morgan told Stoke on Trent Live: 'When you're planning to go out, breach Covid guidance to ""party"" and put yourself and everyone else at risk, can you pause and think about someone else other than yourself?

'My colleagues have been working at full stretch for over three months. They're tired but turn up every day.'

Helicopters circled overhead during the rave in West Kilburn last night as crowds 'refused to leave the location' after officers first engaged with them at 3pm.

The majority of revellers at the West Kilburn 'block party' are thought to have later marched through London to take part in a rave in Maida Vale.

A Met Police spokesperson yesterday said: 'Police are responding to an unlicensed music event on Harrow Road, W9.

'Officers were called to the location around 15:00hrs following concerns from residents. Officers engaged with the attendees, who refused to leave the location.'

Metropolitan Police Commissioner Dame Cressida Dick said 'consequences will follow' for those who attack officers and damage property.

She wrote in The Sun that it has been a 'very difficult week' in the capital, with officers coming under attack as they tried to break up crowds.

She said: 'The officers I met this week were poised to deal with whatever they faced. Hundreds ready in full kit, should there be a violent or aggressive crowd to deal with.

'My message to those involved in thuggery and criminal damage is consequences will follow.'

Dame Cressida earlier said the force had a 'duty' to stop unlawful music events during the Covid-19 pandemic and vowed: 'We will be prepared this weekend.'

She said police were on the lookout for illegal parties after dozens of officers were injured in violent scenes in Brixton on Wednesday evening and in Notting Hill on Thursday.

The commissioner said: 'We have seen some large numbers of people completely flouting the health regulations, seeming not to care at all about their own or their families' health and wanting to have large parties.

'It is hot. Some people have drunk far too much. Some people are just angry and aggressive and some people are plain violent.

'We will be prepared this weekend. We have officers all over London working hard again to try to keep the peace and to protect our public from violence and disorder.'

She suggested the number of police injuries is now 'heading up to 140-odd officers' in the past three weeks, including those hurt during protests in the wake of the death of George Floyd in the US.

Speaking of the protests, Dame Cressida - who insisted the force is not institutionally racist - told HuffPost UK: 'Over the last few weeks, and I'm sure I'm not the only one, I've become much better informed about the Black Lives Matter movement and multiple events –but in particular the appalling video of George Floyd's death.

She added: 'The phrase Black Lives Matter is a very important one. Black lives do matter and should matter to us all, obviously, and in this city of all cities and my police – which I believe is the best in the world and is here to bring justice, prevent crime and keep people safe.'

Home Secretary Priti Patel told the Daily Express those who attack police 'will be taken off our streets'.

John Apter, the national chair of the Police Federation, has warned the Government's announcement about loosening the lockdown on July 4 could be 'a countdown to party time'.

He said: 'This will, without doubt, add more pressure on policing, paramedics and the wider NHS.'

It comes after a week of disorder following multiple illegal parties held during the June mini-heatwave - in which temperatures have soared to 90F.

Disorder broke out at a rave in Colville Gardens, Notting Hill in the early hours of yesterday - just 24 hours after a 'mini riot' broke out in Brixton.

On Wednesday night in Brixton, police vehicles were smashed and officers pelted with bottles during clashes with a large crowd, with Downing Street condemning the 'appalling' scenes and Ms Patel calling them 'utterly vile'.

Three men suffered knife wounds during a fight on a packed Bournemouth beach yesterday, while 50 youths brawled in Exmouth, Devon.

Met Commissioner Cressida Dick spoke with Priti Patel over the illegal raves this week

One officer was injured and five police vehicles trashed at an illegal party attended by 150 people in Longsight, Manchester this week.

Police broke up 39 gatherings in Greater Manchester on Thursday alone.

It follows three lockdown-defying raves earlier this month, during which a teenager was raped, three people were stabbed and a man died of a suspected drug overdose.

Mayor Sadiq Khan announces £110million police cuts hours after Met chief Cressida Dick vowed to crack down on London's illegal raves in showdown talks with Home Secretary Priti Patel London Mayor Sadiq Khan stunned the public after announcing £110million of police cuts just hours after Met chief Cressida Dick vowed to crack down on London's illegal raves. The top officer, 59, said 140 force staff had been hurt trying to break up the outlawed gatherings which she branded 'completely utterly unacceptable'. She insisted the police had managed to stop a number of the lockdown-breaking events, including one in Mitcham last night. But it came as Mr Khan said he expected to have to make cuts to police funding due to a £493million shortfall sparked by the pandemic. The developments came hours after a phone call between Dame Cressida and Home Secretary Priti Patel. Mrs Patel had said she wanted a 'full explanation' after fear police were losing control of the streets. Advertisement

In Carrington, there were reports of three separate stabbings at a 2,000-strong party, including one which left an 18-year-old man with life-threatening injuries. Two other men, aged 25 and 26, were also injured.

Police said they are also investigating the rape of an 18-year-old woman who attended the Carrington event.

In Oldham, a 20-year-old died of a drug overdose during a party of 4,000. His family are today being supported by specialist officers.

Illegal ravers also caused chaos on the M1 near Leeds as well, after police attempted to break-up a 'huge crowd' of young people partying in a concrete tunnel near to the busy motorway.

And a fight erupted among 100 people at a beach in Bridgend, South Wales.

Commissioner Cressida Dick said scenes from Notting Hill showed 'very unacceptable behaviour but very much less serious' than the trouble in Brixton.

The commissioner, who noted some injuries may not be reported until after the incident, suggested the number of police injuries is 'heading up to 140-odd officers, I think, in the last three weeks'.

Speaking to the Daily Express, Ms Patel said: 'The police have my full support in upholding the rule of law and tackling this thuggery.'

She added: 'I want to see those responsible arrested, brought to justice and taken off our streets - before they put even more people in danger.'

Ken Marsh, of the Met Police Federation, said: 'We have got to get a grip. We need to be in control and I think we will see a more robust strategy put in place.'

Former-commissioner Lord Blair told BBC Radio 4's Today programme said: 'It cannot be right that this level of injury to officers is seen as acceptable.'

He added: 'This is not a normal situation where an occupation carries this sort of risk of injury every day.

'That seen as the policewoman riding her horse and being smashed against the road sign because people were so angry is just not appropriate.

'Obviously this is a matter for courts and sentencing but I also think it is actually a matter for public conversation. This should not be like this.'

Commissioner Dick came under pressure as she was accused of turning the Met into a 'laughing stock' and abandoning 'law abiding residents' to 'mob rule'.

The top officer, 59, said 140 force staff had been hurt trying to break up the outlawed gatherings which she branded 'completely utterly unacceptable'.

She said the police had managed to stop a number of the illegal music events, including one in Mitcham last night.

But as she vowed to crack down on illegal raves, Sadiq Khan yesterday announced £110million of police cuts - to the astonishment of the public.

It came as Mr Khan, the London Mayor, said he expected to make huge cuts to police funding due to a £493million shortfall sparked by the pandemic.

Commenting on the outbreak of illegal raves, Nigel Farage told MailOnline he fears a summer of violence after police in London were attacked.

He said: 'There is more to come. Respect for the police is gone'.

Inmates made three gallons of illegal 'hooch' and bashed a man for cheating at cards when they were given the run of the jail for a reality TV series.

Sheriff Eric Higgins unlocked the cell doors of a block in the Pulaski County jail in Arkansas for a radical experiment to see if they could govern themselves.

The six-week trial was documented by a TV crew and hidden cameras and edited into Unlocked: A Jail Experiment now screening on Netflix.

However, the series enraged blindsided local officials who only learned about the show, and the experiment, when the Netflix trailer was released.

They claim Higgins went rogue and signed an illegal contract allowing 'reckless, irresponsible, and dangerous' changes to jail operations to be shown to the world.

Higgins hailed the experiment a success and planned to roll it out to four other general population blocks across the prison.

Sheriff Eric Higgins unlocked the cell doors of a block in the Pulaski County jail in Arkansas for a radical experiment to see if they could govern themselves

The eight-episode series documented 46 inmates including 13 accused murderers, along with drug dealers and wife beaters, in Block H in February to April 2023.

Pulaski County Detention Facility is a remand center where inmates are locked up until they face trial or make bail. Some who appeared on the show were later convicted and sent to jail elsewhere and two were acquitted.

They included Raymond 'AJ' Lovett, 24, who was in December jailed for life without parole for shooting dead Leighton Whitfield, 21, as he visited his fiancée in hospital.

Despite the prisoners eventually achieving tentative harmony, learning to work together, and creating a system to run the block, there was plenty of drama.

Several fist fights were caught on camera where inmates punched each other in the face, but they were usually broken up by other prisoners in a few seconds.

However, in the last few days of the experiment a new inmate joined the block and was caught cheating at cards, enraging the losing player.

The pair agreed to settle the score in a cell out of sight of the cameras, but instead the card cheater was jumped by three and viciously beaten.

The beating almost derailed the entire experiment, which would have put the inmates in lockdown up to 23 hours a day.

Weeks earlier, other inmates made three gallons of prison wine 'hooch' from fruit, Kool-Aid, bread crusts, and water left to ferment for days.

They also used a battery stolen from a clock to light 'cigarettes' made from toilet paper and coffee grinds, and make ink for crude prison tattoos.

One scene showed what appeared to be inmates smoking marijuana, but turned out to be dried-up broccoli and coffee grounds that one prisoner tried to sell to others as a scam.

This clandestine partying abruptly ended when a smoke alarm went off and deputies in body armor stormed the block and confiscated all the contraband.

Much of the tension in the show was between a group of 'oldhead' inmates who tried to maintain order, and the 'youngsters' who resented being told what to do.

There were moments of humanity when inmates spoke of how the program helped them be better people and realize their mistakes.

A hardened, heavily tattooed gang member almost cried on camera admitting he ruined his life due to drugs and needed to change.

The sheriff's office was paid $60,000 for allowing the filming, which it turned over to general county revenue. Higgins was not personally paid for his appearance.

Sheriff's radical plan

Higgins is a Democrat and longtime supporter of prison reform, introducing programs after his 2019 election that help inmates re-enter society.

These programs caught the attention of Lucky 8, a production company that made several other jail-focused documentaries, which approached him in 2021.

Higgins was frustrated with inmates often being locked down for 23 hours a day due to staff shortages, especially during Covid.

He said this built up tension among prisoners that was released when they were allowed out of their cells.

The sheriff said in the second episode that Little Rock homicides were worst in 20 years, and half of crime was by repeat offenders.

'If all we're doing is locking people up… that's all we're ever gonna do. There's not gonna be a change in behavior,' he said.

'I don't want this place to be just a place for punishment. I want this to be a place where reform happens.'

He said prisoners in other countries had more freedom in jails than the US but lower recidivism rates, showing it worked.

Higgins was frustrated with inmates often being locked down for 23 hours a day due to staff shortages, especially during Covid

Higgins last week told county officials the 'no lock, no officers' claim in the Netflix trailer was 'hyperbole' it was using to promote the show.

The plan involved leaving the doors to each cell unlocked during the day, with everyone back inside from 10pm to 7am.

The guards usually posted at a desk inside the block, or 'pod' as it's known in the jail, were moved to a room about six feet outside the pod door.

Guards closely monitored the prison CCTV, but could not see the dozens of cameras installed around the block by the TV crew.

Inmates were also, after the first two weeks, given unlimited and free phone calls, paid for by Lucky 8, during certain times of day.

Inmates still had to stand by their doors for regular headcounts, medication and commissary delivery, and when food carts and laundry were taken in and out, as normal. All the usual jail rules still applied.

The guards usually posted at a desk inside the block (pictured before the change), or 'pod' as it's known in the jail, were moved to a room about six feet outside the pod door

Higgins said two other blocks in the jail had similar rules and no locks on their doors, but were for the best behaved prisoners in the jail who earned it.

Inmates are divided into tiers one to four, four being problem prisoners locked in solitary. The unlocked cells setup had never been tried on the tier two and three inmates who made up Block H.

Prisoners were selected for the series after being vetted by the sheriff's office and production crew, and then asked to volunteer for a documentary about life behind bars without being told about the experiment.

Anyone facing federal charges or accused of a sex crime, or with any past sexual convictions, was excluded.

Prisoners who agreed to be filmed were given $75 by Lucky 8 they could use to buy goods from the commissary like instant noodles or headphones.

Higgins admitted at the start of the show he was staking his reputation on the experiment and was not sure if it would work - but was worth trying.

Furious officials were blindsided

Unlocked was destined to be controversial, but whipped up outrage among local officials because they had no idea it was happening.

None of the county's elected leadership knew about the series until they saw the trailer after it was released last month.

Chief Roy Baker with the Arkansas First Responders Bureau was the most scathing in his criticism, claiming the experiment itself was too dangerous.

'Sheriff Higgins made mention that there were detention officers in the area, and they have a view of them by video in a specific location,' he said.

'However, even if this was the case, and this would be the best case scenario for this project, it is absolutely reckless, irresponsible, and dangerous.

'At no time should any inmate feel that they have even the smallest amount of freedom or reign within the detention facility.'

Arkansas Governor Sarah Huckabee Sanders blasted Higgins for taking the guards out of the block and unlocking the doors

Baker noted the jail was understaffed for many years and though Higgins' plan tried to solve that, it created 'more serious concerns'.

'Had there been a fight or other issue, it would have taken much longer for an officer response and the backup for that officer would have an even longer response time,' he said.

'That leaves a detention officer fighting for their life while they attempt to maintain order.

'The county judge and other county administration should have absolutely been notified and several meetings should have been had on the planning stage.'

Arkansas Governor Sarah Huckabee Sanders also blasted Higgins for taking the guards out of the block and unlocking the doors.

Pulaski County Judge Barry Hyde

Turning our prisons into a free-for-all all reality show is dangerous and insulting to our brave law enforcement officers who put their lives on the line to apprehend violent criminals,' she said.

'This is a reckless decision by the Pulaski County Sheriff and highlights the need for our new state prison to keep repeat violent offenders off our streets and our communities safe.'

Higgins may also have illegally signed a contract with Lucky 8 in the August 15, 2022, release form allowing the crew to film inside the jail.

Pulaski County Judge Barry Hyde, who also functions as the county's chief executive and day-to-day administrator, is the only one with the authority to sign contracts that are legally binding for the county.

Higgins argued the release form was not a contract and was the same as when jails around the US allow news crews to film inside prisons.

County Attorney Adam Fogleman and other local legal figures have weighed in over the past weeks and agree the form was an illegal contract.

'It doesn't matter what they thought it was. It's a contract,' Hyde told local media after a council meeting last week.

Unlocked was destined to be controversial, but whipped up outrage among local officials because they had no idea it was happening

Hyde said he didn't want to show local residents 'at their worst' with the rest of the world.

'People are very upset because they believe this is the next installment of Gang War: Bangin' in Little Rock, which was probably the worst PR for central Arkansas ever,' he said.

Hyde said Higgins first proposed the idea in late 2021 but county legal experts had issues with Lucky 8's proposed contract and negotiations broke down.

He claimed the sheriff then went behind everyone's backs to approve and participate in the series anyway.

'My primary concern now and always has been that the sheriff stepped outside of his authority by signing a contract he doesn't have authority to sign,' Hyde told DailyMail.com.

'The only person, by state law, who can legally bind the county into a contract is the county judge.

'The question now is: how are we going to resolve the issue of an illegal contract? We are exploring that at this time.'

Another possibly illegal issue was that two deputies were paid $40 an hour by Lucky 8 for extra shifts, possibly as security for the TV crew.

The County Quorum Court, its legislative body made up of 15 elected justices of the peace, passed a resolution last week demanding Higgins answer 40 questions about the production and his experiment.

Phil Stowers, one of the JPs, said he was 'sickened' by the trailer. 'I can only imagine how damning the full documentary will be,' he said.

Higgins answered the questions, some of which were obtained by KATV and other local media, and explained details of how the plan worked.

Higgins argued the release form was not a contract and was the same as when jails around the US allow news crews to film inside prisons

He said he did not notify several state and local agencies because there was no need to as all state jail standards and local policies were followed.

The situation has gotten so tense that the Quorum and Hyde allocated $150,000 to retain outside legal counsel and Fogleman advised Higgins to get his own.

'This will end up in court one way or another,' one JP said.

Higgins has the support of several local churches, who said they saw positive changes in inmates they ministered to.

'It was amazing. I would encourage anybody to watch it before you criticize it. I honor the sheriff for making this particular decision. It is not popular, but I believe it is purposeful,' Eric Crowder-Jones with Another Chance Ministries said.

Other Little Rock clergy released a joint statement of support after hearing from Higgins that he wanted to humanize people who would one day be released.

'Sheriff Higgins expressed the intention of giving those inmates the opportunity to become better by allowing them to govern their freedom, rather than to sit in a caged area and become bitter,' they said.

Viewers were also stunned by the show, calling it 'unhinged'.

Concern before the cell doors opened

The first episode featured a final meeting before the experiment began in which some senior deputies expressed their concerns.

'It's kinda scary. They could create some type of riot situation. That would be one of the worst-case scenarios,' said Lieutenant Derrick Freeman, who was worried about a mass escape attempt.

Deputy Jessie Ownes added: 'It's terrifying… Once the doors are open, I feel like it's gonna be a s**tshow.

'I hope I'm wrong but they're not used to the doors being open and not having a deputy in here to hold them accountable.'

Many of the inmates were just as skeptical when the plan was announced days before the cells were unlocked.

'He's not an idiot, he knows this is going to fail, he knows there's no way that you can let criminals govern theirself,' Daniel 'Crooks' Gatlin, 38, a gangster charged with aggravated robbery said.

Deputy Jessie Ownes said: 'It's terrifying… Once the doors are open, I feel like it's gonna be a s**tshow

Another named Willie Lovelace, 50, said the prison was just giving them a chance to screw themselves.

'We're betting against you on all odds that you clowns is gonna f**k up. And the moment that you do, we can show America, this is why we keep you stupid clowns behind the door,' he said.

Randy Randall, 46, who was charged with domestic assault and drug possession, quickly started organizing a group of older prisoners to run the pod.

Nicknamed 'True Story' as it was his frequent catchphrase, he was one of the major characters on the show and involved in most of its pivotal events.

'I think this is going to work, I have faith in it,' he said. 'I'm the vibe boss!'

Randall was filmed speaking to inmates nicknamed Tiny, Crooks, Finch, and Squirrel about forming a group to maintain order, but not all of them were enthusiastic and some were annoyed he was trying to boss them around.

Meet the inmates

Unlocked in the first episodes profiled eight inmates who would be major players in the series, and interviewed them and other characters on their banks throughout the six weeks.

Krisna Piro Clarke, 35, was charged with aggravated robbery and first degree battery and nicknamed Tiny because he was skinny and only 5ft 3in.

He was in the notorious Crips gang and committed his first crime aged eight when he stabbed an older kid who threw a football at the back of his head.

'I've been stabbing motherf**kers ever since,' he said.

John 'Eastside' McAllister, 28, charged with drug possession with firearm, was the block's tattoo artist and in jail 14 times since he was 19.

He never got his driver's license but had been in high speed chases and 'some worse s**t', and used meth since he was eight.

'All I've been around is criminals… I love that adrenaline rush high, knowing you could get caught,' he said.

McAllister's first crime was robbing a pet store, while high on meth, pills, and acid, and stole a pillowcase full of snakes and reptiles.

But an iguana bit his penis when he ran from the cops, and he was caught when a snake tightened around him and he couldn't breathe properly.

Mason 'Mayham' Abraham, 21, from Mississippi was charged with capital murder and was fighting the charges so he could see his young daughter again.

He was the most prominent of a group of younger prisoners who clashed with Randall's older crew and often spoke for them.

Chauncey Young, 20, was charged with aggravated robbery, theft, first degree battery, and drug possession with intent to deliver.

Another of the younger group, he was facing decades in jail but said 'I'm really not supposed to be here… I can't accept my fate' and wanted to go to college and working in IT if he got out.

Gatlin, a heavily tattooed gangster and drug dealer, said his 'Crooks' nickname came from his teeth and eyes being a bit crooked.

'I'm a criminal for real. You better f**king worry about me, buddy. I'm gangster as f**k, I'm mot going for no silly s**t. I'm gonna do real bad, but I'm gonna take care over everybody around me. I was a scumbag,' he said.

He said he was a meth addict who was dealing since he was 13, and as a teenager was injecting a gram of meth seven times a day.

Gatlin traced his life of crime back to when his dad died in a car accident when he was nine, drinking and racing in the street until he hit a telephone pole, flew out the windscreen and broke his neck.

He said getting sober for three months in jail made him want to turn his life around and he thought the program would help him a lot because it made him feel like 'I can do this for real' outside jail.

Later in the series, Raymond 'AJ' Lovett, 24, was introduced - easily the highest-profile inmate in the series.

He was awaiting trial for capital murder after shooting dead Leighton Whitfield, 21, who was visiting his fiancée Jade Pye at CHI St Vincent North Hospital.

Lovett, who was an acquaintance of his victim, walked into the fourth floor room and asked if they were together, then shot Whitfield and walked away.

He was on suicide watch when he first arrived after splitting his head open in the police car whacking it on a belt buckle in a suicide attempt.

'We run the pod now'

The doors unlocked and inmates burst out of their cells, celebrating and yelling 'we run the pod now'.

But tensions between different generations began almost immediately after the doors were unlocked at the start of episode 2.

The youngsters were keen to enjoy the freedom of being out of their cells and resented Randall and his group telling them they still had to follow the jail rules.

This dynamic became the defining storyline of the first half of the experiment and the cause of most of the drama.

But the block's stability had a more immediate problem: David Miller, who was locked up after being arrested for domestic battery.

Unlike most of the prisoners, Miller had both culinary and business degrees and was a night manager at a Wingstop.

But he seemed to delight in needling other inmates that built up anger and threatened to derail the whole program.

McAllister explained Miller had been moved from two other blocks after being beaten up in each of them, and said he deserved it.

Finally in episode 3, having had enough of his antics, two inmates lured him into a cell away from the CCTV - but not the TV cameras - and punched him twice in the face to teach him a lesson.

Despite this, ice water being thrown on him as he lay in bed, and a come to Jesus meeting with Randall, he didn't seem to learn.

The conflict finally ended when Miller started carving a shank on one of the door locks in plain sight of cameras.

'Why should I run and hide? There's no reason for me to. This place can be dangerous at time, but I don't have fear, I'm going to keep doing what I've been doing,' he told the camera.

But his boneheaded move was quickly spotted by prison guards who confiscated the weapon and kicked him out of the pod.

Generational conflict spills over

By day eight, prisoners had become comfortable that without a guard in the block whatever they did in their cells wouldn't be seen.

The youngsters began acting up and Randall got worried they would mess up and derail the program, so he called a meeting.

'I'm gonna make sure these doors stay open. No exceptions,' he said.

One of the things the older inmates tried to clamp down on was the making of hooch, which was very much against prison rules.

The youngsters were keen to enjoy the freedom of being out of their cells and resented Randall (pictured) and his group telling them they still had to follow the jail rules

However, this didn't go down well because one of Randall's top lieutenants, nicknamed Squirrel and a dead-ringer for actor Samuel L Jackson, was a big drinker of it.

'I can't take advice from somebody that's a hypocrite,' one of the younger prisoners said.

Mayham added afterwards: 'They want us to do the right thing for the program. Man, come on… It's a pod full of felons. We're not kindergarteners, we in jail.'

Randall tried a new strategy of reaching across the generational divide, starting by showing them how to cook creative meals, like a bizarre makeshift pizza using liver, with jail food and they ate together.

Even Mayham started to come around: 'Randall, he's been through this way longer than us. This unit is working the way it's supposed to because of him.'

The stability had inmates forming Bible classes, addiction meetings, group workouts, and playing basketball, and told the TV crews how mature everyone was being.

'No other unit is doing what we're doing… it's paradise,' one prisoner said.

By day 13 everything was going so well that Higgins was ready to proceed to the next part of the plan - giving the inmates free, unlimited phone calls.

This created drama as there were only so many phones, but Higgins said it was an important part of them working together.

Randall came up with a solution – a phone list so they knew who was in line before them. The access to phones allowed them to reconnect with family and more easily contact lawyers about their cases.

But the 'paradise' was lost just a few days later, starting with Clarke getting some bad news in a phone call with his family.

Upset, he got into a petty argument with Randall that escalated into a fistfight on the upper level of the pod in full view of the other inmates.

Nearby prisoners broke up the scuffle in seconds, but it was a body blow to Randall's credibility as a leader and stoked tensions once more.

'He's a good dude, but he's the type that he want to run the show,' Randall's cellmate Big Mel said in an interview.

'He acts like a guard – get in your cell, get up and put your shirt on. Man, I hate this, I hate people like that. And at the same time Randy's causing problems.'

The pair soon had a chat in their cell in front of the cameras, where Mel told Randall people called him 'Pod Daddy' and were sick of him being in their business.

Breaking point came when Young started taunting him as he was trying to adjust the TV channel, shouting 'piggy pig, pig' over and over.

Randall snapped and charged at Young and the pair fought until others pulled them apart.

'He a hypocrite, he the main one causing problems. Then he want to tell everybody what not to do... look at yourself, you're doing stuff too. Words don't give you a reason to put your hands on nobody,' Young said after the fight.

McAllister's cellmate Tyler, 19, later observed that Randall 'gets mad at people for no reason'.

'There's literally not a day that goes by that he's not yelling at somebody… you youngsters are not f**king with him no more,' he told another inmate.

But Randall maintained it wasn't his fault: 'It ain't me, it's us, it's all of us, not just me.

'I always stick my nose in their business to stop them… the mishaps come along here because everybody think you're trying to boss them.'

Chaos reigns

Seeing his position was untenable, Randall stepped back from leadership and the rest of the 'oldheads' followed suit.

'So we gonna find out and see what's going to happen now,' he said.

Seeing this happen Higgins and his deputies became concerned that a power vacuum could lead to chaos. They were right.

Because Randall stopped organizing food distribution, and role he had even before the experiment, inmates missed meals and the youngsters began hoarding it.

Some of the hoarded food was used to make three gallons of hooch, a prison wine that would be a major infraction if discovered by guards.

'Now that no one's in charge, we're all just gonna get wild. We're gonna have fun, and we're just gonna party. Because the hooch makes everything feel nice,' McAllister said.

Tyler explained to the film crew how to make it, starting with putting hoarded fruit in a bag and leaving it in hot water and adding Kool-Aid due to its high sugar content, and bread crust to release yeast.

'It de-fermen-tates it... I guess that's the word,' he said. 'We gonna be drunk as hell.'

McAllister, as the tattoo artist, was in charge of creating a wick out of wound-up toilet paper that would burn like a fuse and be used to light other things.

First they tried using a pair of glasses to ignite leaves and paper in the yard, but the wind blew it out so they decided on a riskier strategy.

As the documentary crew filmed, an inmate was boosted up by others in a camera blind spot and took the clock off the wall. They used the battery to light the wicks and replaced the clock like nothing happened.

McAllister explained that he made tattoo ink by lighting a makeshift candle in a metal alcove in his cell, and scraped off the soot that collected on the metal.

He put two staples together at the top of a pen to make the tattoo injector and charged $5 for a name and $15-20 for more complicated art.

The wick also lit 'coffee sticks' made from a napkin soaked in black coffee that is spread over it with a toothbrush and left to dry outside, giving inmates a small high.

Guards remained none the wiser about these illicit operations until one of the wicks set off a smoke alarm at the end of episode 5.

After contraband was found in rooms nearby, Higgins responded by sending in deputies dressed in riot gear to search the entire pod and strip search everyone.

Wicks, the hooch, and various prescription pills were found and confiscated.

The sheriff put everyone on 24-hour lockdown so they could think about whether that was what they wanted to go back to.

Higgins decided to continue with the program after that, but set up an anonymous vote afterwards where inmates could nominate a troublemaker and anyone with more than one vote would be moved to another block.

Despite the jail code of never snitching, Randall and the other older inmates advocated voting out those who threatened to derail the program.

As each inmate cast their vote one by one, McAllister decided to take the fall for the entire pod, as he was the instigator.

'Jail helps you look at your whole life… I'm going to evaluate myself and some of the stuff I've been doing,' he said.

'You hit a spot in your life where you don't even want negative stuff in your life anymore. And I feel like I've hit that spot this time.'

He was given restrictions for a week, but allowed to stay as Higgins was impressed with him taking responsibility.

Lovett spent a week in solitary confinement as the lockdown gave him suicidal thoughts, and was given a warm welcome on his return.

'It's nasty in the hole. You have a bunk but you don't have a mattress when you're on suicide watch,' he said.

'They give you one blanket, you have no mat to sleep on. I guess so you don't choke yourself out. Here is heaven compared to the hole.

'I was thinking about the unit the whole time I was in there and I was worried they weren't going to bring me back here… this is the best unit in the whole jail right now.'

Heartbreaking moments

Between the drama, there were emotional moments for the prisoners as the experience made them want to change their ways.

Phone calls to loved ones had inmates opening weeping at what they missed, or realizing how they ruined their lives.

'I don't wanna be like these other dudes, 'cause that's why they ready to fight and crash out and lose their spot because they know they not going home,' Young said through tears in an interview from his bunk.

Gatlin, despite being a hardened gangster, was on the verge of tears as he explained that getting sober in jail made him regret his life choices.

'I'm not responsible enough, I'm not strong enough... to take care of myself. My actions put me here,' he said.

There's a lot of people in here who are really smart and have a lot of talent, that don't know how to take care of themselves.

'I know what to do, but I just don't do it, and I don't know why. I have to man up and realize that and take care of myself.'

Later in the show, inmates were given double the usual number of visitations - two a week, and Gatlin's sister Juanita visited him.

'This program has helped him out, tremendously. These inmates, they need stuff like that, and in prisons,' she said after her brother cowed to go to rehab.

'Because they're eventually gonna get out, and we need this type of rehabilitation or encouragement, [otherwise] they're just gonna go right back in. This time I can really see a difference, so I'm really fighting for him.'

Clarke also got a visit from his son and the boy's mother, who had earlier refused to see him, where the teenager told him he was forgiven.

Falling at the last hurdle

New inmates were admitted to the block to replace those who were moved out, made bail, or were convicted and imprisoned elsewhere.

One of them, nicknamed Weekley, was caught cheating at cards by a longstanding prisoner named CJ, who furiously attacked him.

The pair were separated before the fight was spotted by guards, but agreed to settle the score later in his cell.

Furious about the newcomer cheating, two other prisoners went into the cell too, and viciously bashed Weekley while others watched through the door window.

When deputies arrived he told them he fell out of the top bunk and was taken to hospital while saying it hurt to breathe.

Surveillance footage soon revealed what really happened and all four inmates involved were kicked out and everyone put back on lockdown.

Higgins now doubts the whole plan can work as harmony needs to be maintained when new people come in due to it being a transitional jail.

'They're not taking it seriously, they don't see the opportunity that they have, they don't see that we could do something different,' he said.

'So I don't know if it can really work.'

He told the inmates they had until the next day to convince him that the doors should stay open.

'I don't know what they're going to do, I don't know if it's too late,' he said afterwards.

The inmates called a meeting to figure out what to do, and faced with the prospect of losing their relative freedom and access to loved ones, finally work together.

Old rivalries are finally settled and Clarke and Mayham give speeches about how much they respect the other generations.

Inmates look dejected as Higgins says he may be forced to send them back into lockdown over the beating

They agree on a plan where new inmates would get a 30-minute orientation and anyone who didn't follow the jail rules would be forced out after too many strikes.

After the meeting, Randall and Young buried the hatchet from their feud, and agree they blew everything out of proportion.

'I stopped coming to your rooms and demanding stuff, because you inspired me the way you sat back and I sat back,' Randall said.

He told Young the first time he went in jail at 22 his kid was one and when he got out they were eight, and he doesn't want him to miss his family like that too. He told him to pay it forward and help other people.

The next day, Higgins returned and the inmates made their case, but the sheriff was unconvinced.

'Y'all sat back and let things happen, this whole time. You didn't make the cocktail, but maybe you drank it. Are you serious? How many times have you told me you're serious? Every time I come in here,' he said.

Higgins told the inmates they had until the next day to convince him that the doors should stay open

Lovelace argued that the inmates were serious, but it took them a while to understand because they were new to working with other people.

'So it took us a while, because we slow. Look how long it's taken us to get along in life,' he said.

Higgins replied: 'It's not just about you, it's about the safety of this facility, it's about the deputies who work here, and the people coming after you… I don't know.'

The sheriff said he would let them know his decision the next day.

'This program's got my name on it, so there's a lot on the line. I'm trying to do something different to change the legacy of the facility, but I'm not truly convinced that the doors need to be opened,' he told the camera afterwards.

'I don't know what I'm gonna do.'

Higgins, after some dramatic tension, announced he would leave the doors unlocked because he could see the inmates were finally trusting each other.

'I believe that the lightbulb has come on,' he said.

Did it work?

Higgins at the end of the show, and in an interview last month, argued the experiment was a success even though it wasn't perfect.

'If I were to do this again, I've learned they can make anything out of anything,' he said.

'If we commit to something like this, and we learn form the experience and continue to try to improve what we're doing, we can create a safer detention facility.

'It's not just for the jail itself, we have people in this facility, some will be released to the community, some will go to federal prison. Wherever they end up, we're interested in them being a better person.'

Higgins at the end of the show, and in an interview last month, argued the experiment was a success even though it wasn't perfect

Inmates also spoke about how the experience made them better people who wanted to turn their life around, and improved their social skills.

'Before, I was just wanting that adrenaline rush high, and anything to get that fix, I was with it,' McAllister said.

'Now, I feel better as a person where I don't have to look over my shoulder…. I know this has helped me, and I want it to continue to help me.'

Higgins said H Block had fewer disciplinary actions against inmates since the series was filmed than any other block, which is backed up by jail statistics provided as part of the Quorum's demands.

H Block is still functioning the same way as during the experiment a year later, and Higgins plans to to the same with four other blocks in the jail.",Outrage over Netflix's 'reckless' Unlocked experiment that gives inmates including murderers the run of prison in Arkansas,1

It was those people at the heart of our communities who always lose most when this happens: our shopkeepers.

It is our shopkeepers – small family businesses in many cases – who suffer the terror of looting.

Thus it was that across the nation, ahead of last Wednesday's anticipated resumption of anti-immigrant riots – which spurred 41 of our regional police forces to gather in force on the High Streets – many thousands of shops were pre-emptively boarded up.

But, beyond a mere handful, the would-be rioters never showed up. Instead, there were thousands of anti-racist campaigners, carrying placards.

Many declared exultantly that it was they who'd 'scared off' those designated 'far-Right extremists'. And a former assistant commissioner of the Metropolitan Police, Neil Basu, told the BBC that 'the anti-racist protesters effectively shamed them off the streets'.

Really? Are those hooligans endowed with a great sense of shame? I don't think so. Neither do they strike me as averse to a punch-up on the streets.

No, the reason they didn't show up for a repeat performance, either then or at the weekend, is that the first of their number had already been sentenced to a stretch at His Majesty's pleasure: Derek Drummond, given three years for violent disorder and attacking a policeman in Southport. This was a man with 14 previous convictions.

Others quickly followed, and the judiciary took the unusual step of releasing film of the judges passing sentence.

According to the Met, of the most violent men arrested during the rioting in Whitehall, around 70 per cent have criminal backgrounds. This is unsurprising and familiar. Familiar, that is, from the London riots in August 2011, in which an estimated 2,500 mostly small family retail businesses were hit by looting and arson.

Those riots followed the shooting dead by the police of Mark Duggan, a member of a street gang called Tottenham Man Dem. Around three quarters of the more than 3,000 people arrested then had criminal records.

They then begin aggressively pulling high-end puffer jackets off a clothing rack

Then, too, the courts acted in the opposite way to the normally glacial progress: they were kept open round the clock, and after five days of condign sentencing (one youngster with 'no previous' was given six months in the slammer for nicking a case of bottled water from a supermarket), the rioting abruptly stopped.

Sir Keir Starmer was then the Director of Public Prosecutions who authorised this instant justice. Afterwards, he observed: 'I think people gamble on: 'Am I going to get caught? Am I going to get sentenced and sent to prison?'

'And if the answer is 'I'm watching on television some other people who had been caught 24 or 48 hours after they were on the streets with us', I think that's a very powerful message.'

Indeed it is: now, as it was in 2011.

But it is the opposite message to that which the police – who held the line so bravely against the rioters – send to the nation's shopkeepers at any other time.

This was shockingly exposed by the Mail's Guy Adams in his report from Chiswick High Street, which is one of London's most pleasant shopping areas (or at least it was).

In May, Marks & Spencer became the first to get a prolific offender jailed with the help of a private investigation and prosecutions company: TM Eye. The man involved was David Hanson (pictured)

Adams interviewed several of the shop owners left enraged by the Met's apparent insouciance during a campaign of gangs stripping stores of valuable produce at will. Many of the shops had, as a result, boarded up – for good.

The manager of the fashion boutique Riccado, a family business which had opened on Chiswick High Street 30 years ago, told Adams how, in February, one of these gangs had ransacked the shop and carried off clothing worth at least £25,000.

Called that evening by a traumatised assistant, the manager next morning reported the incident to the police, telling them that she had CCTV footage showing the faces of some of the gang, and that as they weren't wearing gloves, there would be fingerprints.

The police never came round … until eight days later, when the manager (who didn't want her name to be published, out of fear of reprisals) handed over the CCTV footage.

Next day, she was told by the police: 'It is unlikely we will be able to identify those responsible. We have therefore closed the case.'

The chairman of M&S, Archie Norman, has said that retailers 'have to accept that the police aren't interested' in tackling shoplifting

No wonder, as Adams reported, that 'barely a day goes by without a fresh report of some feral gang striding into a local store and casually making off with thousands of pounds worth of stock. CCTV of their heists, including dozens of films obtained by the Daily Mail, show how they combine menace with staggering impunity'.

Last month, the Daily Telegraph produced a similar report, from Shoreham-by-Sea in Sussex, where demoralised small shop owners described a situation of 'lawlessness', with the town having the joint highest crime rate, relative to the population, in the whole country, and the proportion of shoplifting offences unsolved in the town centre and beach areas at 97.6 per cent.

An antiques shop owner, Nigel Wareham, told the paper: 'Nothing gets done. Police don't come out. We had three break-ins on this road this week alone.' Not surprisingly, shops are boarding up … and a community dies a bit more.

The biggest companies have the resources to act when the police won't. In May, Marks & Spencer became the first to get a prolific offender jailed with the help of a private investigation and prosecutions company: TM Eye.

Sir Keir Starmer, when the Director of Public Prosecutions (pictured in 2009), said: 'I think people gamble on: 'Am I going to get caught? Am I going to get sentenced and sent to prison?'

The thief, David Hanson, broke into an M&S store in Streatham Hill, by smashing a glass window, and grabbed £500 worth of produce. It was all on CCTV. The manager called the police … but nothing doing. (The chairman of M&S, Archie Norman, remarked that retailers 'have to accept that the police aren't interested' in tackling shoplifting.)

As a result of the private prosecution, Hanson was jailed for a year for five offences, including one assault on an M&S employee.

What is the new Government doing about the fact that violent and abusive attacks on shopkeepers rose by 50 per cent in 2022-2023, while police failed even to show up on the scene of 40 per cent of violent shoplifting incidents?

In the King's Speech, it was announced that assault on shop workers would be made a specific criminal offence. This was something Rishi Sunak had set in train before the election scuppered that legislation. The Conservative proposal specified a maximum sentence of six months. Big deal. Let's see if Labour can do better.

But even if they propose a more stringent penalty, what is the point if the police take the view that theft, abuse, casual violence and even the loss of livelihood is the occupational hazard of being a shopkeeper?

https://www.theguardian.com/environment/live/2024/nov/12/world-leaders-to-speak-as-cop29-resumes-live-updates,1,"From 12 Nov 2024 15.06 GMT UK commitment to cut greenhouse gas emissions must be 'starting point, not finish line', climate advisers say More reaction has been rolling in on the UK’s new commitment to cut greenhouse gas emissions, which were trailed to my colleague, Fiona Harvey, last night, and then finally delivered by Keir Starmer, the prime minister, in a statement in Baku this afternoon. Shruti Agarwal, senior adviser on climate change and sustainable economies at Save the Children, said: The UK government’s commitment to an 81% emissions reduction by 2035 is an encouraging step. But let this be the starting point, not the finish line, in the UK’s ambition to protect children who continue to bear the brunt of the climate crisis COP29 is an opportunity to build on this global leadership with further meaningful action on climate both in the UK and around the world. It’s time we stand with children and put their voices at the heart of every aspect of climate change decision-making and financing. As COP29 progresses we hope to see the UK drive forward discussions for a new international climate finance goal and action in the UK ensuring a fair, just transition for all. Friederike Roder, vice president of global policy and advocacy, Global Citizen, said: The UK’s ambitious new NDC sends a powerful message that climate action is unstoppable, and that climate leadership can and will be found across the world The UK’s decision to listen to climate scientists, and to citizens, and reduce emissions by 81% will cement its position as a global leader in climate action. The decision to do so early - at this critical moment - is equally important in building momentum and setting an example for others to follow. Like all commitments at COP, the proof will be in the delivery. But by setting early goals and outlining ambitious targets, the UK is showing much needed leadership at this important moment. We hope this leads to all nations setting ambitious, high action NDCs that keep the world on track for 1.5 degrees, and encourages those here at COP29 to deliver an NCQG which provides the vital finance to achieve these goals. But the UK’s job isn’t done: so far, it has not made any new commitments on international public finance for climate. The poorest countries in the world urgently need additional support to fund their NDCs, ensure a just energy transition and withstand natural disasters. The UK could also show leadership in mobilising new sources of finances by joining the Task Force on Global Solidarity Levies.

12 Nov 2024 16.09 GMT Closing summary It is after 8pm in Baku now and time for us to wrap up the live blog, as the estimated 67,000 or so delegates, lobbyists, journalists and others do their evening stuff (brushing their teeth and getting ready for bed, I hope). But before we go, here is a summary of the day’s main news lines from the summit. The UK’s ambitious commitment to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 81% must be “the starting point, not the finish line”, commentators have said. The commitment was officially delivered to Cop29 in a statement by Keir Starmer this afternoon. It has been broadly welcomed.

Starmer made the commitment in one of dozens of statements given by national leaders on the second day of the the climate summit in Baku . But it is only now, with the big cheeses on the way home, that the serious negotiations will get underway.

Mia Mottley said the world must take radical action on raising the money needed to fund climate adaptation. “These extreme weather events that the world is facing daily suggest that humanity and the planet are hurtling towards catastrophe,” the prime minister of Barbados said.

Hilda Heine, president of Marshall Islands, called out rich countries for failing to finance cuts to pollution but encouraged poor countries to still put forward ambitious climate action plans. “It is in our blood to know when a tide is turning,” she said. “And on climate, the tide is turning today.”

Charles Michel, president of the European Council, spoke on behalf of the EU to warn against war and present itself as a credible partner to poor countries . He called out “violent imperialism, endless cycles of vengeance” as a driver of wars that have driven the world to the brink.

2024 had been “a masterclass in climate destruction”, Antonio Guterres, the UN secretary general said , as he addressed world leaders who had gathered in Baku for the summit. “But there is every reason to hope,” Guterres said.

The UN’s top climate official, Simon Stiell, warned world leaders “worsening climate impacts will put inflation on steroids”. “The climate crisis is a cost-of-living crisis, because climate disasters are driving up costs for households and businesses,” he said, describing it as an “economy killer”.

The UNHCR, the UN’s refugee body, released a report saying climate breakdown is making life even more difficult for people fleeing war and persecution . It finds that three-quarters of the 120 million displaced people around the world are in countries severely affected by climate breakdown.

The UN gave the provisional number of participants in this year’s conference as 66,778. This includes everyone from heads of government to security staff to journalists. The number was significantly down from the 83,884 who attended last year’s talks in the United Arab Emirates.

A new analysis found social media platforms are becoming “dangerously polluted” by falsehoods about the climate crisis. The actions of big oil and big tech are helping reframe extreme weather events and sow conspiracy theories about renewable energy, the report found. Share

12 Nov 2024 15.43 GMT Dharna Noor US president Joe Biden’s climate policy was designed to outlast his administration, the White House’s top climate adviser said at Cop29 on Tuesday, writes Dharna Noor, fossil fuels and climate reporter for the Guardian US. “The way we built climate action in the United States was akin to the public sector coming in with booster packs on a private sector rocket,” Ali Zaidi told reporters. The Biden administration’s landmark policy, the Inflation Reduction Act, provided billions of dollars in tax credits, loans, and other incentives for the private sector to increase its green spending. But the recently re-elected former president Donald Trump has vowed to claw back the policies “unspent” funds, sparking alarm from the climate movement. “What we will see is whether we’ve achieved escape velocity or not and how quickly the booster packs are about to fall off,” Zaidi said. Despite his record incentives for carbon-free energy and green technology, under the Biden administration, oil and gas production soared to record levels. When asked about the uptick, Zaidi deflected. “The US has in the last four years has doubled its decarbonization pace from below 20% to above 40% in 2030, relative to 2005 levels,” he said. “If every country did that and did it again in the next five to 10 years, we would be headed where we need to head.” Asked about the lame duck administration’s ability to influence climate finance negotiations at the international climate talks in Baku, Zaidi asked reporters to “keep in mind that we’re talking about a climate finance goal for 2035.” Despite his optimism, Zaidi said he did not “mean to sugarcoat the result of the election.” “Leadership matters and there’s no talking around that,” he said.

12 Nov 2024 15.31 GMT Large parts of Greenland and west Antarctica will melt if the world exceeds 1.5C of global heating, a report released this morning by the International Cryosphere Climate Initiative has warned. This will lead to more than 10 metres of sea level rise even if temperatures later fall, which will have catastrophic effects for the billions of people living at low elevations. About three-quarters of large cities sit less than 10 metres below sea level, and many metropolises including Shanghai, Bangkok, Manila, Miami, Osaka, Alexandria and Rio de Janeiro will be severely affected. The report also finds that high mountain glaciers in Asia are expected to lose about half their ice, increasing the risk of disastrous floods from glacial lakes and irreparably affecting the water cycle downstream, where many communities rely on water that originates in these areas. It also warns that emissions from melting permafrost are likely to reach a tipping point and create a cycle of emissions that will not be able to be stopped for one to two centuries, meaning enormous levels of carbon will have to be removed from the atmosphere by future generations in order just to stand still, let alone make progress.

12 Nov 2024 15.06 GMT UK commitment to cut greenhouse gas emissions must be 'starting point, not finish line', climate advisers say More reaction has been rolling in on the UK’s new commitment to cut greenhouse gas emissions, which were trailed to my colleague, Fiona Harvey, last night, and then finally delivered by Keir Starmer, the prime minister, in a statement in Baku this afternoon. Shruti Agarwal, senior adviser on climate change and sustainable economies at Save the Children, said: The UK government’s commitment to an 81% emissions reduction by 2035 is an encouraging step. But let this be the starting point, not the finish line, in the UK’s ambition to protect children who continue to bear the brunt of the climate crisis COP29 is an opportunity to build on this global leadership with further meaningful action on climate both in the UK and around the world. It’s time we stand with children and put their voices at the heart of every aspect of climate change decision-making and financing. As COP29 progresses we hope to see the UK drive forward discussions for a new international climate finance goal and action in the UK ensuring a fair, just transition for all. Friederike Roder, vice president of global policy and advocacy, Global Citizen, said: The UK’s ambitious new NDC sends a powerful message that climate action is unstoppable, and that climate leadership can and will be found across the world The UK’s decision to listen to climate scientists, and to citizens, and reduce emissions by 81% will cement its position as a global leader in climate action. The decision to do so early - at this critical moment - is equally important in building momentum and setting an example for others to follow. Like all commitments at COP, the proof will be in the delivery. But by setting early goals and outlining ambitious targets, the UK is showing much needed leadership at this important moment. We hope this leads to all nations setting ambitious, high action NDCs that keep the world on track for 1.5 degrees, and encourages those here at COP29 to deliver an NCQG which provides the vital finance to achieve these goals. But the UK’s job isn’t done: so far, it has not made any new commitments on international public finance for climate. The poorest countries in the world urgently need additional support to fund their NDCs, ensure a just energy transition and withstand natural disasters. The UK could also show leadership in mobilising new sources of finances by joining the Task Force on Global Solidarity Levies. Frans Berkhout, professor of environment, society and climate at King’s College London, said: The Prime Minister’s announcement on UK climate action at COP29 in Baku is highly significant. The 81% emissions reduction target for 2035 is tougher than the existing target.

12 Nov 2024 14.58 GMT Canada tells methane emitters 'you can run but you can't hide' as satellite monitoring tracks culprits Damian Carrington “You can run but you can’t hide,” is the warning Steven Guilbeault, Canada’s minister of environment and climate change, gave to methane emitters at the Cop29 summit on Tuesday, writes Damian Carrington, environment editor. Satellite monitoring now enables leaks to be spotted from space and UN and other initiatives are now identifying culprits and demanding action. Methane is an extremely potent greenhouse gas, 80 times more powerful than carbon dioxide over 20 years, and causes about a third of global heating. The good news is that, unlike CO2, methane breaks down in the atmosphere quickly and therefore cuts rapidly slow warming. Fossil fuel exploitation causes a lot of leaks, but these are often cheap to fix. Former UN climate chief Patricia Espionosa told delegates that cutting methane is “essential” to taming the climate crisis. US special climate envoy John Podesta announced the implementation of fines for large methane leakers. A major leak in Texas in 2022 released 147 tonnes an hour, for example, will cost the operator $220,000 per hour from 2026, which should get their attention. Cop29 president Muktar Bubayev said methane emissions were still going “in the wrong direction” and that this year’s focus was on the methane pouring from waste dumps as food rots. The Guardian revealed in February more than 1200 huge methane leaks from dumps. China’s special envoy, Liu Zhenmin, said it was working to cut emissions from coal mines by two-thirds. The World Bank has also targeted methane reductions and president Ajay Banga highlighted projects in dozens of countries. Methane emissions from cattle were being reduced with better breed and feeds, as well as manure management, in China and Brazil, he said, and emissions from rice growing were being cut with more frugal irrigation in India and Bangladesh. Leaks from oil and gas pipelines were also being tackled in Iraq and Bangladesh, both major emitters. The UK’s Ed Miliband summarised the action being taken on different greenhouse gases by saying: “CO2 is the marathon, methane is the sprint.” Share Updated at 15.00 GMT

12 Nov 2024 14.53 GMT Ajit Niranjan The crown prince of Jordan, Al Hussein bin Abdullah II, criticised the Israel-Gaza war as well as stressing the climate threats to his country, one of several world leaders at Cop29 to address both issues together, writes Ajit Niranjan, Europe environment correspondent. “How can we work together for our shared future when some are deemed unworthy of life?” he asked, criticising the international community for standing by as Palestinians have been killed. He added that war compounds environmental threats, particularly for refugees, who make up an estimated 1 in 3 people in Jordan. “Our inability to collectively do what is right is turning us into passive observers,” he said. “No-one is a bystander in the fight for life on earth. That means fighting for climate change, fighting for peace and fighting to alleviate human suffering together. Because every life is worth fighting for.” Share

12 Nov 2024 14.50 GMT Starmer unveils ambitious new UK emissions commitment The UK prime minister, Keir Starmer, has told delegates at Cop29 that the UK will set an ambitious new target to slash carbon emissions by 81%, as he pledged the country would stand alongside countries “on the front line of the climate crisis”. The announcement made the UK one of the first countries to announce an official UN carbon cutting plan — officially known as a nationally determined contribution. The blueprints are not due until February next year. Starmer said: “Today I can confirm, three months ahead of the deadline, the UK’s 2035 international target, our nationally determined contribution, to reduce all greenhouse gas emissions by at least 81% on 1990 levels. “And we urge all parties to come forward with ambitious targets of their own, as we all agreed at the last Cop.” View image in fullscreen Keir Starmer, the UK prime minister, delivering his statement at Cop29. Photograph: Maxim Shemetov/Reuters After listing some of the green energy policies already pledged or enacted since his coming to power this summer, Starmer promised the UK would support other countries in making a transition to cleaner energy sources. A new capital market mechanism was launching today on the London Stock Exchange, exploiting the UK’s power as a financial centre to finance the green transition. “Climate action is at the heart of this government’s mission for the protection and prosperity of Britain and the world, writ large across our domestic and international priorities,” he said. “We are taking the action needed to protect our planet and its people.” Share Updated at 14.53 GMT

12 Nov 2024 14.36 GMT Ajit Niranjan Alexander De Croo, prime minister of Belgium, has spelled out in simple words the state of progress and the task ahead, writes Ajit Niranjan, Europe environment correspondent. “This is not a time to falter. Emissions continue to rise and we see more and more destructive climate disasters,” he said. “If we do not alter our policies, we will see an increase of 3C by the end of the century. He added: “Meetings like these are often perceived as talking shops. And yes, these strenuous negotiations are far from perfect. But if you compare climate policy now to a decade ago, we are in a different world.” View image in fullscreen Alexander De Croo, prime minister of Belgium, warned the development of electricity grids and storage capacity had failed to keep pace with the rise in renewables. Photograph: Maxim Shemetov/Reuters De Croo also pointed to two overlooked aspects of the energy transition – simply using less, and building vital but overlooked infrastructure. “The safest, cheapest and cleanest energy is the one we don’t use,” said de Croo. “We must do more on energy efficiency, it’s a win-win.” He added that the development of electricity grids and storage capacity had failed to keep pace with the rise in renewables.

12 Nov 2024 14.34 GMT Mia Mottley: ""Humanity and the planet are hurtling towards catastrophe"" Mia Mottley, prime minister of Barbados, said in her speech that the world must take radical action on raising the money needed to fund climate adaptation. She said: “We are in a season of superlatives and the reality is that these extreme weather events that the world is facing daily suggest that humanity and the planet are hurtling towards catastrophe. “The extreme weather requires from us a serious commitment at this Cop with respect to new collective quantified goals that enable us to reverse the current trajectory and to fund mitigation, adaptation and, of course, loss and damage.” View image in fullscreen Mia Mottley, prime minister of Barbados, alongside the UK prime minister, Keir Starmer. Photograph: Peter Dejong/AP Mottley is a legendary figure at UN climate talks. For years, she has spearheaded a push to transform how global financial institutions handle climate funding. The mission has borne fruit, the Guardian’s Fiona Harvey wrote this week, since the new World Bank president recently promised to take a more active role in climate finance. But in her speech, Mottley criticised a lack of funding for loss of damage, pointing out the fund has attracted pledges of only $700m so far: “And this is despite the numerous crises besetting small island developing states. And, indeed, in our own region, Hurricane Beryl, which has caused serious damage to countries, from housing to public infrastructure.” Under Mottley’s leadership, Barbados removed the British queen as head of state, become a fully fledged republic.

12 Nov 2024 14.16 GMT Ajit Niranjan The president of Spain, Pedro Sánchez, said he was coming with a “terrible truth” in a fast-paced speech that took aim at climate deniers and laggards on cutting pollution, writes Ajit Niranjan, Europe environment correspondent. “We need drastic measures,” he said. “We need to transform.” Late last month, catastrophic floods hit southern and eastern Spain killed 220 people, after rains that would have been weaker and less likely had people not heated the planet with fossil fuel pollution. Sánchez has announced €10bn in aid to help rebuild the disaster zone. “This societal threat is obvious to everyone,” said Sánchez. “But at this crucial time for humanity, we are seeing governments hesitate and slow down when they should be accelerating. Some are even denying evidence and turning back.” View image in fullscreen An improvised junkyard in the flood-hit municipality of Massanassa, province of Valencia. Photograph: Biel Aliño/EPA Share

12 Nov 2024 13.32 GMT Earlier we reported the powerful speech of Hilda Heine, president of the Marshall Islands, a low-lying island state facing severe threats from the rising waters caused by climate breakdown. She is one of only eight women leaders representing their countries at Cop29 – nine tomorrow when Giorgia Meloni of Italy is due to arrive. Observers have raised eyebrows at the lack of gender equality at the summit. “Once again, women are being silenced and cut out of critical negotiations around the climate catastrophe and the future of our planet,” said Helen Pankhurst, senior advisor on gender equality at CARE International UK. She added: Women and girls are contributing the least to the climate crisis, yet world-over they are paying the highest price. If we want to see a fair outcome from climate negotiations, which make a genuine difference, we’ve got to start seeing women represented equally at the very highest levels. We are currently hearing from Philip Isdor Mpango, vice president of Tanzania. It is not clear why Samia Suluhu Hassan, the country’s president, is not representing Tanzania. Share

Sudan is in the grip of what the UN has described as “one of the worst humanitarian nightmares in recent history”, after a civil war broke out in April and both sides were accused of war crimes. It has contributed almost nothing to heating the planet but is one of the most vulnerable to extreme weather made worse by climate change. “Climate change is a key priority for Sudan, because it is vital for its national development,” said Al-Burhan.

Fans of the queen of country music were thrilled when the account appeared, putting up an introduction clip in which she was clad in a yellow top with patterned yellow and blue pants.

'Why hello, I guess I'm on TikTok! I just dropped in to say that it will be okay,' the 75-year-old iconic singer-songwriter said before singing. 'If I can do it, so can you ... I believe in you.'

But their hopes were dashed when the account was banned by the app, with a number of Parton's fans taking to TikTok on Monday to complain.

A spokesperson for the singer explained to NBC's The Today Show that an unverified user had taken an old video from Parton's Imagination Library website and 'doctored it' to create the @itsdollyparton account.

'Take a closer look...' the spokesperson said, noting that TikTok had removed the video. A spokesperson for the company said the video had been removed for violating the social media platform's guidelines on impersonation.

It is unclear if Dolly Parton or her representatives complained to the platform over the account and the video, or whether TikTok took the initiative to take it down.

The account had already amassed in excess of 680,000 followers and a million likes by the time it was taken down, according to People.

After it was banned, fans expressed they were upset and confused by the move before the clarification was made.

One user wrote, 'WHY WAS DOLLY PARTON BANNED FROM TIKTOK,' while another noted, 'Dolly Parton joined tiktok and then was banned immediately.'

Another user mused, 'The number of trolls I’ve (and other creators) have reported on Tiktok and somehow they choose to ban the pride of America, Dolly Parton.'

General Mark Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and his deputies reportedly pledged to resign en masse if they were given an order by Trump that was illegal or unconstitutional.

'They may try, but they’re not going to f***ing succeed,' Milley told his deputies.

'You can't do this without the military. You can't do this without the CIA and the FBI.

'We're the guys with the guns.'

The dramatic quote excerpted by CNN was revealed in a new book authored by Washington Post reporters Philip Rucker and Carol Leonnig titled I Alone Can Fix It: Donald J. Trump’s Catastrophic Final Year.

The book is scheduled for release next week.

General Mark Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, was so convinced that then-President Donald Trump would attempt a coup after his election loss to Joe Biden that he and other senior generals made plans to stop him, according to a new book. Milley is seen left with Trump at the Army-Navy college football game in Philadelphia in December 2018

Milley reportedly referred to Trump supporters as 'brownshirts' and compared the former president to Hitler. The image above shows Trump supporters rioting at the US Capitol on January 6

Days before the riot at the US Capitol on January 6, Milley warned confidantes of a ‘Reichstag moment’ facing the country.

According to the book, his concern stemmed from the fact that Trump was preaching ‘the gospel of the Führer.’

Milly referred to Trump supporters at a march to protest the election as ‘brownshirts in the streets.’

In 1933, after Hitler was elected chancellor of Germany, the Nazis used a fire at the Reichstag building, home to Germany’s parliament, as a pretext to suspend civil liberties and consolidate power by claiming the country was under threat from communists.

The claims were made in a new book due out next week titled I Alone Can Fix It: Donald J. Trump's Catastrophic Final Year

The brownshirts were Nazi paramilitaries who helped Hitler rise to power.

'Milley told his staff that he believed Trump was stoking unrest, possibly in hopes of an excuse to invoke the Insurrection Act and call out the military,' Rucker and Leonnig write.

The joint chiefs chairman was especially worried by the fact that Trump purged the Defense Department of those who raised objections to his ideas and replaced them with loyalists after the November election.

Days after the election, Trump fired Defense Secretary Mark Esper and replaced him with Christopher Miller.

Other deputies to Esper were also fired and replaced with those who shared the then-president’s views.

In December, Attorney General William Barr resigned after he refused to endorse Trump's claims of rampant voter fraud.

The departures of Barr and Esper left Milley concerned, according to the book.

Milley reportedly told friends that he felt he needed to be ‘on guard’ in anticipation of what might happen.

According to the authors, Milley told associates that he believed Trump was ‘the classic authoritarian leader with nothing to lose,’ which led to the Hitler comparisons.

Milley is portrayed in the book as a key figure that stood between Trump and an overthrow of the government.

THE 1933 REICHSTAG FIRE: A KEY TURNING POINT IN GERMANY'S DEMOCRATIC DECLINE The February 27, 1933 file photo above shows the Reichstag building, Germany's parliament, on fire. It is considered a key turning point in the Nazi rise to power The German Reichstag fire of February 27, 1933 remains a pivotal moment in world history. That arson blaze ignited one of history’s ugliest stories of a fragile democracy gone tragically bad - and its generational consequences. Adolf Hitler, leader of the Nazis, elected Germany's dominant party six months earlier, had exploited the fire – which he claimed was set by a half-blind, disabled, Dutch communist bricklayer – to transform Germany into a militarized dictatorship. This set in motion the Third Reich, World War II, the Holocaust, the destruction of Europe and the deaths of 60 million people, 2.5 percent of the global population. In 2008, German prosecutors formally overturned the conviction of the Dutch communist who was executed after the Nazis accused him of torching the Reichstag parliament building. Marinus van der Lubbe, a bricklayer, was convicted of arson and high treason in December 1933 and executed on January 10, 1934. Historians still debate whether van der Lubbe, a communist, actually set the fire, which came just a month after Hitler's rise to power and was followed by the suspension of civil liberties. Some believe the Nazis set it themselves to give Hitler an excuse for his crackdown against what he termed a 'communist conspiracy.' Van der Lubbe was the only defendant convicted of arson at the subsequent trial. Four other communists charged with him were acquitted by a Leipzig court. Federal prosecutors said his conviction was overturned because the death sentence resulted from measures introduced under the Nazis 'that were created to implement the National Socialist regime and enabled breaches of basic conceptions of justice.'

The book quotes an anonymous friend of the general who tells him: ‘What they are trying to do here is overturn the government.

‘This is all real, man. You are one of the few guys who are standing between us and some really bad stuff.’

The book contains several other reported conversations between Milley and other officials, including White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows.

According to the book, Milley warned Meadows to ‘be careful’ and not fire then-CIA Director Gina Haspel and FBI Director Christopher Wray.

In the weeks after the election, Trump fired his defense secretary, Mark Esper (left), and appointed several loyalists to top Pentagon posts. Bill Barr (right) resigned as attorney general. Their departure left Milley concerned that Trump would try to engineer a coup to stay in power

'What's going on? Are you guys getting rid of Wray or Gina?' Milley reportedly asked Meadows.

'Come on chief. What the hell is going on here? What are you guys doing?'

'Don't worry about it,' Meadows reportedly told the general during the Army-Navy football game in December.

'Just some personnel moves.'

Milley warned Meadows as if to indicate that he was watching, according to the book.

Rucker and Leonnig reported that after the Capitol riot, Milley held daily conference calls with Meadows and Mike Pompeo, who was secretary of state under Trump.

Milley reportedly used the conference calls to ‘collectively survey the horizon for trouble.’

'The general theme of these calls was, come hell or high water, there will be a peaceful transfer of power on January twentieth,' a senior official told the authors.

'We've got an aircraft, our landing gear is stuck, we've got one engine, and we're out of fuel.

'We've got to land this bad boy.'

Milley told aides he saw the calls as an opportunity to gauge what Trump might try to do, according to the book.

The authors also reported that weeks before the election, Pompeo visited Milley at home and told him: ‘You know the crazies are taking over.’

Pompeo denied making the remark, according to the authors.

Another excerpt in the book describes a conversation between House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Milley.

According to the book, Milley warned the Trump White House to ‘be careful’ and not fire then-CIA Director Gina Haspel (left) and FBI Director Christopher Wray (right)

Another excerpt in the book describes a conversation between House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Milley. After the Capitol riot, Pelosi told Milley she was worried that Trump was ‘crazy,’ ‘dangerous,’ and a ‘maniac’

After the Capitol riot, Pelosi told Milley she was worried that Trump was ‘crazy,’ ‘dangerous,’ and a ‘maniac.’

After Trump fired Esper, Pelosi reportedly told Milley: ‘We are all trusting you. Remember your oath.’

The speaker reportedly expressed concern that Trump would deploy nuclear weapons in a desperate attempt to stay in power.

Milley tried to reassure the speaker.

‘Ma’am, I guarantee you these processes are very good,’ the general told her.

‘There’s not going to be an accidental firing of nuclear weapons.’

Pelosi then asked: ‘How can you guarantee me?’

‘Ma’am, there’s a process,’ Milley replied. ‘We will only follow legal orders. We’ll only do things that are legal, ethical, and moral.’

The book also reports on a telephone call between Milley and House Rep. Liz Cheney, the Republican from Wyoming who broke with her party to criticize Trump.

Cheney’s vote to impeach Trump for his role in the January 6 riot led her caucus to remove her from a House GOP leadership position.

According to the book, Milley was told by House Rep. Liz Cheney (left), the Republican from Wyoming, that she smacked the hand of fellow GOP congressman Jim Jordan (right) during the Capitol riot, telling him: 'Get away from me. You f***ing did this'

Prior to the vote, Cheney was the No. 3 Republican in the House.

On the day after the Capitol riot, Milley asked Cheney how she was doing.

‘That f***ing guy Jim Jordan. That son of a b***h,’ Cheney is reported to have said.

Cheney then told Milley that during the violence, as a mob of Trump supporters ransacked the Capitol and sent members of Congress scurrying for safety, she ran into Jordan on the House floor.

Jordan, the Republican congressman from Ohio, is one of Trump’s most ardent supporters.

After the election, Jordan amplified Trump’s claims that the election was illegitimate due to rampant voter fraud.

‘While these maniacs are going through the place, I’m standing in the aisle and he said, “We need to get the ladies away from the aisle. Let me help you.”

Though there are still risks around the restructuring, which has seen Anglo American sell off its coal and platinum assets, the Jefferies analysts said a drop in the company's share price leaves the stock looking good value.

The US bank's analysts said that after the restructuring is complete, Anglo American will be well-positioned to benefit from a rising copper price and a resilient iron ore price.

The company should also have a strong balance sheet and robust cash flow, enabling it to deliver large capital returns.

With Anglo American shares down around 15 per cent since the restructuring was unveiled in May, the Jefferies analysts also lifted their share price target for the stock to 2850p from 2500p.

Anglo American's shares topped the FTSE 100 risers, up 5.4 per cent, or 129.5p, to 2520.5p.

https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/jul/03/mount-rushmore-south-dakota-indigenous-americans,1,"Mount Rushmore national memorial draws nearly 3 million visitors a year to its remote location in South Dakota. They travel from all corners of the globe just to lay their eyes on what the National Park Service calls America’s “shrine of democracy”.

Phil Two Eagle is not opposed to the fact that the giant sculpture of American presidents is a major tourist attraction but he thinks the park should have a different focus: oppression.

“It should be turned into something like the United States Holocaust Museum,” he said. “The world needs to know what was done to us.”

Two Eagle noted what historians have also documented. Hitler got some of his genocidal ideas for ethnic cleansing from 19th and early 20th century US policies against Native Americans.

Two Eagle is Sicangu Lakota and a member of the Rosebud Sioux Tribe in South Dakota. He directs the tribe’s treaty council office which fights to claim sovereignty over lost homeland. He is part of a growing indigenous movement across the US and Canada that is demanding the return of Native American territory seized through broken treaties. And ground zero for the movement is Mount Rushmore.

Opposition is already proving staunch. Yet while Native Americans have been fighting to get their lands back for centuries, indigenous activists say real progress finally seems possible now that Deb Haaland, a member of Laguna Pueblo, is secretary of the interior. As the first Native American to hold a US cabinet position, Haaland oversees 450m acres of federal land – all of it indigenous territory and much of it stolen through broken treaties.

“Having Haaland heading up the Department of Interior is a game changer,” said Krystal Two Bulls, who is Oglala Lakota and Northern Cheyenne and director of NDN Collective’s Land Back campaign, an initiative demanding that governments honor their treaties with Indigenous people. “It opens the door for beginning the healing process. Returning our land is the first step toward reparations.”

Mount Rushmore is located in the Black Hills, a nearly 2m-acre expanse of fertile forests, creeks and rocky outcrops that is sacred to the Lakota. The Black Hills is the place they call “the heart of everything that is”. After decades of fighting to keep European immigrants out of their homeland, the Lakota, Dakota and Nakota people reached a settlement with the US government and signed the Fort Laramie treaties of 1851 and 1868. The agreements established a sovereign 35m-acre “permanent home” for the Plains tribes called the Great Sioux Nation that occupied the entire western half of South Dakota, including the Black Hills.

But in 1874, Lt Col George Armstrong Custer led a survey party into the Black Hills without permission from the tribes and discovered rich gold deposits. Rather than abide by its treaties, which the US constitution calls the “supreme law of the land”, the federal government allowed gold prospectors and settlers to overrun the Black Hills and surrounding area.

Members of the Great Sioux Nation were forced to surrender most of their territory and move to much smaller reservations on what was deemed useless land by the US government. Decades later, the busts of four US presidents – two slave owners and two who were hostile toward Native Americans – were chiseled into the holy mountain the Lakota called “Tunkasila Sakpe”, the Six Grandfathers.

Based in Rapid City next to the Pine Ridge reservation, the social media-savvy NDN Collective was energized by last summer’s Black Lives Matter protests and resolved to launch a similar campaign promoting the return of indigenous lands. That effort suddenly accelerated when Donald Trump showed up at Mount Rushmore on 3 July last year for a fireworks-studded re-election rally.

NDN Collective organized a protest that blocked the road to the park, claiming the rallygoers were trespassing on sovereign lands of the Great Sioux Nation. Indigenous activists wore eagle feathers, beat drums and faced off with a line of air national guard who were dressed in riot gear. No physical violence broke out but the assembly was deemed unlawful by the county sheriff and 20 activists were arrested. Videos of the protest went viral and so did the “#landback” hashtag along with NDN’s demands for returning the Black Hills and closing Mount Rushmore, which the group described as “an international symbol of white supremacy”.

Meanwhile, inside the park, the former president told his cheering base what they wanted to hear. “Our nation is witnessing a merciless campaign to wipe out our history, defame our heroes, erase our values and indoctrinate our children,” he said, referring to the recent removal of Confederate monuments. The crowd chanted “USA! USA!” in response.

Elise Boxer, who is Dakota and a professor at the University of South Dakota where she directs the Native American Studies program, said the request for the return of homeland is largely misunderstood by non-indigenous people. “It is not about owning the land. It is about regaining a spiritual relationship to the land,” she said.

The memories of frontier settlers engaging in bloody battles with Native Americans are still raw in South Dakota, Boxer said. The Black Hills are the ultimate symbol of that racial tension. “If our land is returned, there is the fear by non-indigenous people that they may be treated in the same way the early settlers treated us,” she said. “And there is also a very paternalistic belief held by the government that Natives can’t take care of their own land.”

Deciding who has a rightful claim to the Black Hills is actually already settled according to a 1980 supreme court ruling in the case United States v Sioux Nation of Indians. “A more ripe and rank case of dishonorable dealings will never, in all probability, be found in our history,” stated the court’s majority opinion that agreed the Black Hills had been stolen from the Sioux. The court’s solution was to financially compensate the tribes for the land with an award of $2m. However, the tribes insisted the Black Hills were not for sale and they refused the payment. The award has been held in trust and now totals nearly $2bn with interest but the Lakota and other Sioux tribes, who live in some of the poorest areas in the United States, will not accept the money in exchange for their sacred lands.

“We are poor because our resources were stolen from us and those resources made others billions of dollars,” said Red Dawn Foster, an Oglala Lakota and South Dakota state senator representing the Pine Ridge reservation. “But our connection to the Black Hills is not a monetary one. Our main concern is that the land not be desecrated and we be allowed to resume our role as stewards of the land – that is our purpose as Lakota.”

Foster said many of the “social ills” experienced by the Lakota are rooted in the loss of their spiritual connection to the Black Hills and being denied access to sacred sites for ceremonies. She said the Sioux tribes are simply asking for a “transfer of stewardship”, so the Black Hills would no longer be managed by the US Forest Service or Park Service but by the Great Sioux Nation.

Putting Mount Rushmore, along with the rest of the Black Hills, under Native American management is a realistic first step for addressing the harms of colonization, she said.

Corbin Johnson, until recently the mayor of the tourist-dependent town of Custer located in the middle of the Black Hills, is not thrilled about this idea. “Why don’t the people in other places give their land back?” he said of non-indigenous supporters of NDN’s campaign. (Johnson’s term ended 30 June.) “This whole country is on indigenous territory, so where does returning land start and where does it end?”

Johnson has lived in Custer county his entire life and finds the Black Hills “magnetic”. His wife’s family moved to Custer in 1875, the year after the United States broke the treaties and allowed European immigrants to establish homesteads. “I understand the motivation for the land back thing but how do you make it work?” Corbin asked. “Figuring that out goes way beyond me or my town.”

With a Democratic president and Congress in power as well as a Native American woman overseeing federal lands, Daniel Sheehan, chief counsel for the Lakota People’s Law Project, is hopeful steps will be taken to finally address broken treaties.

Since Haaland was sworn in in March, her department has transferred 18,800 federal acres comprising the National Bison Range in Montana to the Bureau of Indian Affairs, where the land will be held in trust for the Confederated Salish and Kootenai tribes. And Haaland has reportedly recommended to Joe Biden that the boundaries of Bears Ears National Monument be restored to their original size in order to protect numerous Native American cultural sites.

Sheehan said there are various legal mechanisms for returning control of Mount Rushmore and the rest of the Black Hills to the Sioux tribes such as passing a bill in Congress or executive action under the 1994 Indian Self-Determination Act. Mounting public pressure also plays a big role. A petition sponsored by NDN Collective requesting the closure of Mount Rushmore and return of public lands in the Black Hills currently has more than 44,000 signatures.

Meanwhile, the staff at Mount Rushmore is attempting to carry out its mission of celebrating the “shrine of democracy” but also incorporate Native American culture as part of the visitor experience. “We strive to provide a broad spectrum of history and messaging,” said the Mount Rushmore chief of interpretation, Maureen McGee-Ballinger. She noted there is a “Lakota, Nakota and Dakota Heritage Village” interpretive display along the park’s main trail. It is staffed by a fifth-generation grandson of the celebrated Oglala Sioux warrior Red Cloud. The current setup is a long way from what Phil Two Eagle envisions possible with a transformed monument that documents Native American genocide.

“After 500 years of injustice, you can’t just put up a fake village manned by a token Indian and say, ‘We’re good,’ “ said Two Eagle. “We want to meet with Biden and ask him to honor the treaties. We want to find out what he will do to stop the ethnocide of our people.”

After the Fort Laramie treaties were abandoned in the wake of the Black Hills gold rush, the Lakota called the US government “wasin icu”, which means “takes all the fat”. Navajo author Mark Charles sees the current battle for the Black Hills as a chance for Anglo Americans to turn that paradigm on its head.

“The United States has historically viewed everything through the lens of exploitation and profit,” he said. “But indigenous people are trying to teach a very young nation a different way of being. We want white Americans to learn that life has so much more meaning if they can just see past the dollar sign.”",The battle for Mount Rushmore: ‘It should be turned into something like the Holocaust Museum’,1

Several fights also broke out as the demonstrators were met with pro-Israeli counter-protesters.

The pro-Palestine students returned to the college's Butler Lawns as early as 5am on Friday. Footage from later in the morning shows them clapping and chanting 'we will not be moved'.

Speaking through a megaphone, one student read a message she said someone from Gaza had sent thanking them for their 'continued support for the Palestinian cause'.

Dozens of students listened to her speak and repeated each line while wearing keffiyehs - a monochrome patterned scarf which serves as a symbol of Palestinian identity - and waved the national flag.

A livestream from the lawns overnight showed hundreds of students beating drums and singing.

Protester Maryam Iqbal told The Nation: 'Being suspended for Palestine is an honor. The more they try to silence us, the louder we will get.'

Through the day on Thursday, dozens of cops clad in riot gear arrived to disperse the camps.

Columbia president Shafik said they were called after 'attempts to resolve the situation were rejected by the students involved'.

'As a result, NYPD officers are now on campus and the process of clearing the encampment is underway,' she said.

Videos posted by the organizers show people being handcuffed while protesters chanted 'shame on you' at the officers.

China says the law is needed to tackle 'terrorism' and 'separatism' in the Asian financial hub it now regards as a direct national security threat.

Opponents fear it will be used to stifle local opposition to Communist Party rule, despite the promise of limited freedoms and autonomy for 50 years after the city's 1997 handover from Britain.

But several conglomerates with mainland business interests have in recent days issued statements supporting the bill, including the Asia-focused banking giants.

The news came after the city's pro-Beijing former leader Leung Chun-ying publicly criticised the British bank for not publicly supporting the law while profiting from its Chinese business interests.

Standard Chartered told MailOnline today: 'We believe the national security law can help maintain the long term economic and social stability of Hong Kong. The ""one country, two systems"" principle is core to the future success of Hong Kong and has always been the bedrock of the business community's confidence.

'We hope greater clarity on the final legislative provisions will enable Hong Kong to maintain economic and social stability.

'This is not an Agatha Christie novel. We know exactly whodunit,' the politician said on MSNBC's 11th Hour. 'And if somebody has got a theory as to why it was really Antifa that did it, then bring the evidence forward, but our bipartisan committee found no evidence of involvement by Antifa.'

The committee also said they thought the former president could be charged with three crimes, including insurrection, but Trump has denied any responsibility for the riot that began to overturn the election results.

Scroll down for video

Representative Jamie Raskin, 60, a Maryland Democrat, (pictured) compared Donald Trump's denial of responsibility for January 6 to an Agatha Christie detective novel, saying: 'We know exactly whodunit'

Trump, 76, claimed if the DC Mayor and Nancy Pelosi had 'listened to him,' Americans 'wouldn't have heard about January 6'

'If they had listened to me, none of this would have happened, and you wouldn't have heard about January 6,' Trump. 76. ranted in a five-minute video he posted on his platform Truth Social, where he called the 845-page report a 'monstrous lie.'

Raskin had other thoughts, telling MSNBC: 'I think that there needs to be a serious reckoning of individual accountability for the people who set all of these events into motion.

'Is there anybody in the count who believes that any of this would’ve happened absent Donald Trump’s will?'

The father-of-three went on to say why he thought Trump was responsible for the riot, including getting the protest date changed from January 21 to January 6 and for trying to force legislators to find him fake votes, which a Georgia grand jury is currently probing.

'He was the one who spread the big lie,' Raskin said on the show. 'He was the one that galvanized the extreme right in the country to focus on the peaceful transfer of power as the target of their wrath and violence.

'He was the one who tried to stage a mini-coup at the Department of Justice and just get the DOJ to declare the election was corrupt and leave the rest to his Republican friends in the House.

'And finally, he was the one who decided to focus everybody’s attention on Mike Pence, and then ultimately to say in the middle of the riot, he didn’t have the courage to do what needed to be done, further inciting and exhorting the crowd which was already chanting: ""Hang Mike Pence.""'

He claimed Trump was the 'central instigator of the whole thing.'

'It is just impossible to think of this happening without Donald Trump being the central instigator,' he told MSNBC.

Trump called the 845-page document a 'monstrous lie' and deflected responsibility for the riot away from himself

He also said he hasn't heard from all his fellow Republicans since the report came out, but for those he had spoken to, he said he told them they needed to 'vote to convict.'

'The facts and the law compelled it, because the Constitution required it, and because the country needed it,' he said he told Republican lawmakers.

'But if nothing else they have to do it to save their own party, because Donald Trump would come to destroy the party. And we are seeing that unfold right now, because Donald Trump has been exposed to the world as the person who orchestrated all of these events to try to topple our constitutional order and seize the presidency.'

However, on Friday, Trump took a different approach, saying the January 6 committee report was fabricated by 'sick people' including Pelosi.

'The unselect committee did not produce a single shred of evidence that I, in anyway, intended or wanted violence at our capitol,' Trump said. 'The evidence does not exist because the claim is baseless and a monstrous lie.

'There was no insurrection and there was not going to be an insurrection. It was made up by these sick people,' Trump stated adding how the House Speaker and the Washington DC mayor refused to honor Trump's request for up to 20,000 National Guard troops to be posted on the streets around the Capitol.

Trump went on to downplay the events of that day and addressed some of the conspiracy theories that have emerged in the time since including how the doors to the Capitol were 'flung open for people to walk in' and that 'federal informants' played a role in the violence.

'The events of January 6th were not an insurrection,' Trump insisted. 'They were a protest that got tragically out of control and which the left has been weaponizing ever since.

'The committee cut the part of my speech out where I encouraged protestors to make their voices heard peacefully and patriotically, but nobody ever says that,' Trump bemoaned.

During the video, Trump defended his actions of January 6, 2021, arguing against the select committee's conclusion that he did not respond to the riot for 187 minutes.

'I think that there needs to be a serious reckoning of individual accountability for the people who set all of these events into motion. Is there anybody in the count who believes that any of this would’ve happened absent Donald Trump’s will?' Raskin said of the riot (pictured)

Trump argued that he issued two tweets urging 'peace and respect' within 25 minutes of the Capitol being breached together with a follow-up statement half an hour later.

'I told protestors to go home with peace and respect,' Trump insisted.

But the report details how 'neither of these tweets had any appreciable impact on the violent rioters.'

'Neither the 2:38pm nor the 3:13pm tweets made any difference,' the report found.

Trump also repeated his claim that he had 'urged the deployment of 10,000 to 20,000 National Guard troops' before the riot 'to keep the event safe.'

Such a claim has been directly refuted by the committee in the executive report.",This is not an Agatha Christie novel': Maryland Rep. mocks Trump for claiming January 6 riot,1
https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jan/09/brazil-congress-attack-stormed-invasion-jair-bolsonaro-supporters-what-we-know-so-far,1,"Thousands of supporters of Brazil’s far-right former president Jair Bolsonaro invaded the country’s congress, presidential palace and supreme court on Sunday, in a grim echo of the US Capitol invasion two years ago by backers of former president Donald Trump.

About 6.30pm local time, three hours after initial reports of the invasion, security forces managed to retake the three buildings, Brazilian media reported. TV images showed dozens of rioters being led away in handcuffs. Police said 300 people had been arrested over the attacks.

The leftist president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, announced a federal security intervention in Brasília – bringing policing under the control of the central government – lasting until 31 January after capital security forces initially were overwhelmed by the invaders. He said the law enforcement bodies showed “incompetence, bad faith or malice” and promised swift action. Lula, as the president is widely known, defeated Bolsonaro in election run-offs last year.

Bolsonaro responded to Sunday’s attacks with social media posts defending his record in government while saying invasion of public buildings crossed the line. “Peaceful demonstrations, within the law, form part of democracy,” he wrote on Twitter. “However, depredations and invasions of public buildings like those that happened today, as well as those practiced by the left in 2013 and 2017, are exceptions to the rule.” He stopped short of condemning the mob outright and instead hit out at Lula’s claims he was responsible.

In a press conference, Lula blamed Bolsonaro and complained about a lack of security in the capital, saying authorities had allowed “fascists” and “fanatics” to wreak havoc. “These vandals, who we could call … fanatical fascists, did what has never been done in the history of this country,” said Lula, who was on an official trip to São Paulo state. “All these people who did this will be found and they will be punished.” The president later toured the wreckage of his presidential palace.

The sight of thousands of yellow-and-green clad protesters running riot in the capital capped months of tension after the 30 October vote. Bolsonaro, an acolyte of Trump who has yet to concede defeat, peddled the false claim that Brazil’s electronic voting system was prone to fraud, spawning a violent movement of election deniers. Bolsonaro flew to Florida 48 hours before the end of his mandate and was absent from Lula’s inauguration. The violence in Brasília could amplify the legal risks Bolsonaro faces. It also presents a headache for US authorities as they debate how to handle his stay in Florida.

Supreme court justice Alexandre de Moraes ordered Ibaneis Rocha, the pro-Bolsonaro governor of the federal district, where Brasília is located, to be removed from his post for 90 days amid outrage that authorities had failed to prevent the attack. De Moraes wrote that the attacks “could only have happened with the acquiescence, or even direct involvement, of public security and intelligence authorities”.

Two Democrats in the US Congress, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Joaquin Castro, called for Bolsonaro’s extradition from the US. “The US must cease granting refuge to Bolsonaro in Florida,” Ocasio-Cortez said, as she compared the protests to the 6 January storming of the US Capitol. “Nearly two years to the day, the US Capitol was attacked by fascists, we see fascist movements abroad attempt to do the same in Brazil.”

The US president, Joe Biden, condemned what he called the “assault on democracy and on the peaceful transfer of power in Brazil”, adding that Brazil’s democratic institutions “have our full support and the will of the Brazilian people must not be undermined”.

The supreme court, whose crusading justice Alexandre de Moraes has been a thorn in the side of Bolsonaro and his supporters, was ransacked by the occupiers, according to social media images that showed protesters clubbing security cameras and shattering the windows of the modernist building.",Brazil congress attack: what we know so far,1
https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-10573565/Ukraine-war-Average-cost-petrol-rises-1-52-litre-time.html,1,"Hauliers have called on British ministers to take action over record fuel prices that are ‘wiping out’ their profits as the average cost of petrol rises above 152p per litre in the days following Vladimir Putin’s lawless invasion of Ukraine.

Figures from data firm Experian Catalist show the average cost of a litre of petrol at UK forecourts passed 152p on Wednesday, up from 151p on Tuesday. The cost of diesel rose from 155.23p to a new high of 155.79p over the same period, the body added.

Oil prices reached an eight-year high last week due to concerns over the reliability of supplies after Russian forces invaded the former Soviet republic. Brent crude reached a 10-year high of nearly 120 US dollars per barrel on Thursday.

The RAC warned ‘further price rises are inevitable in the coming days and weeks’ because UK fuel prices are determined by the cost of oil and the US dollar-pound exchange rate.

Trade body the Road Haulage Association (RHA) has urged the Government to delay upcoming changes to the use of untaxed red diesel by 12 months.

It called for fuel duty to be frozen for a further two years, and greater flexibility with the Apprenticeship Levy to help address driver shortages. The organisation also wants more lorry parking facilities and the continuation of skills bootcamps to train the next generation of drivers.

RHA executive director for policy and public affairs Rod McKenzie said: ‘Ours is a low margin industry – the average haulage business makes an annual profit of 3 per cent. Put another way, the weekly profit of a truck may be £80 but the increase in the price of fuel can equate to between £77 to £87 per week per truck, thereby completely wiping out any potential profit.

‘Of course, hauliers can put up prices. That will add to the general escalating pressures on inflation for everyone. That’s bad for our businesses, some of whose existence is now threatened, and indeed for all of us in the UK as prices rise.

‘But the Government can, and we think should, do something about it.’

Fuel spokesman Simon Williams added: ‘As this period of record high prices could be here for some considerable time, drivers may need to take steps to keep their costs under control. Driving less may be an option for some, but those who depend on their cars will have to try to buy their fuel at the best possible price and then drive as fuel efficiently as possible.’

Britons feel the pinch as petrol prices skyrocket... but what is driving up prices? Petrol prices rocketed to an all time high on Monday as Britons try to recover from the financial battering caused by the pandemic. Pumps hit 176p per litre at some forecourts while the average cost was 155p. It has left panic buyers racing to stations to fill up amid fears prices will only increase in the coming weeks. Here, MailOnline, answers your questions on the spiralling fuel crisis: Why has the price of petrol gone up? Prices on forecourts for petrol and diesel have spiralled across the country and world in recent weeks due to a number of factors. Daily spikes have mainly been caused by high oil costs sparked by Russia invading Ukraine on Thursday. The war caused huge geopolitical uncertainty, with much of the world's oil coming from Russia. Crude oil barrels last week soared to over $100 per barrel for the first time since Russia's last foreign excursion into Crimea in 2014. Why are there some shortages at the pumps? Some stations are closing for the day amid a lack of fuel to sell to customers. The recent storms that swept across Britain meant some deliveries could not be made because ships carrying oil were unable to dock. What is the government doing to help? The government has pumped £12billion in support into the industry, including a freeze on fuel duty for the twelfth year in a row. The Department for Transport said they were also keeping in regular contact with businesses to ensure supply keeps up with demand. Will UK oil refineries be hit? The UK is a significant producer of both crude oil and petroleum products. In the case of diesel, UK demand is met by a combination of domestic production and imports from a diverse range of reliable suppliers beyond Russia including the Netherlands, Saudi Arabia, and the US. Like other countries, the UK holds oil stocks in the unlikely event of a major oil supply disruption. The level of oil stocks prescribed by the International Energy Agency (IEA) is accepted and adopted around the world as being sufficient to ensure resilience in the event of a major global supply disruption. UK oil reserves are significantly above the 90 days required by the IEA. Advertisement

Gas prices have also risen, with the Dutch April gas contract hitting a new record high of €185 per megawatt hour, the UK’s rising almost 40 per cent to 398p a therm in morning trading.

The increases threaten to worsen a cost-of-living crisis that could see millions of families crippled by gruelling £3,000-a-year energy bills, with rising energy prices set to pile further pressure on soaring inflation.

Russia continues to pump supplies into Europe, but the war in Ukraine – Europe’s biggest land conflict in decades – risks near-term disruption and is increasingly isolating the world’s second-largest producer of oil and gas from global energy markets.

BP, Shell, ExxonMobil and the British Gas owner, Centrica, have all vowed to unwind billions of pounds worth of Russian ties as Moscow becomes an international pariah state. Britain is on course to spend £6.3million per day on imports of Russian gas, according to new analysis.

Military analysts say Russia's advance has been a tactical fiasco, with poorly maintained columns now confined to roads as spring thaw turns Ukrainian ground to mud.

Each day the main attack force lies stuck on the highway north of Kyiv, its condition deteriorates, said Michael Kofman, an expert on the Russian military at the Wilson Center in Washington DC.

‘The longer Russian forces sit forward, the lower their readiness and performance will be. Everything from state of tires, to supply availability, and in the end morale,’ he tweeted.

But the great fear is that, as the likelihood of rapid victory recedes, Russia will fall back on tactics it used in Syria and Chechnya, which left the large cities of Aleppo and Grozny in ruins.

Russia has already acknowledged nearly 500 of its soldiers killed. Ukraine says it has killed nearly 9,000, though this cannot be confirmed. Ukrainian authorities have offered to free Russian prisoners if their mothers come fetch them.

Kherson, a provincial capital of around 250,000 people, is the only significant urban centre to fall. Mayor Igor Kolykhayev said on Wednesday Russian troops were in the streets and had entered the council building.

‘I didn’t make any promises to them... I just asked them not to shoot people,’ he said.

Russia’s invasion of Ukraine entered its second week on Thursday with its main assault force halted north of the capital Kyiv and several cities enduring heavy Russian bombing.

The humanitarian crisis also worsened, with more than one million refugees now having fled Ukraine, the United Nations said.

Hundreds of Russian soldiers and Ukrainian civilians have been killed since Putin sent his troops over the border last Thursday. Russia itself has been plunged into isolation never before experienced by an economy of such size.

Despite an initial battle plan that Western countries said was aimed at swiftly toppling the Kyiv government, Russia has captured only one Ukrainian city so far – the southern Dnipro River port of Kherson, which its tanks entered on Wednesday.

Russia has shifted tactics, escalating its bombardment of major cities. Swathes of central Kharkiv, a city of 1.5million people, have been blasted into rubble.

Mariupol, the main port of eastern Ukraine, has been surrounded under heavy bombardment, with no water or power. Officials say they cannot evacuate the wounded. The city council compared the situation to the World War Two siege of Leningrad.

A second round of peace talks between Ukrainian and Russian delegations was due to begin in Belarus at about 2pm London time, Ukrainian negotiator Davyd Arakhamia said.

Kyiv plans to open by discussing humanitarian corridors. A first round of talks on Monday led to no breakthroughs.

Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky has stayed in Kyiv, releasing regular video updates to the nation. In his latest message, he said Ukrainian lines were holding. ‘We have nothing to lose but our own freedom,’ he said.

Britain’s defence ministry said the main body of the huge Russian column advancing on Kyiv was still 19 miles from the city centre, delayed by Ukrainian resistance, mechanical breakdown and congestion.

In Borodyanka, a small town 40 miles northwest of Kyiv where locals had repelled a Russian assault, burnt out hulks of destroyed Russian armour were scattered on a highway, surrounded by buildings blasted into ruins. Flames from one burning apartment building lit up the pre-dawn sky. A dog barked as emergency workers walked through the rubble in the darkness.

Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov characterised the Western response to Russia’s actions as ‘hysteria’, which he said would pass.

Only Belarus, Eritrea, Syria and North Korea voted with Russia against an emergency resolution at the United Nations General Assembly condemning Moscow’s ‘aggression’.

In Beijing, organisers sent Russian and Belarusian athletes home from the Paralympic Games, saying Moscow and Minsk were to blame for violating the Olympic Truce. Russia called the ban ‘monstrous’.

In Russia itself, where nearly all major opposition figures have been jailed or exiled in a crackdown over the past year, the authorities have banned reporting that describes the ‘special military operation’ launched by Putin on February 24 as an ‘invasion’ or ‘war’.

TASS reported on Thursday that Ekho Moskvy radio, the best-known independent broadcaster of the post-Soviet era, would be shut down. Anti-war demonstrations have been quickly squelched by police who have arrested thousands of people.

Riot police snatched peaceful protesters off the streets in St Petersburg late on Wednesday, including a 77-year-old woman filmed being muscled away by men in black helmets. Activists distributed footage of a small girl weeping behind bars, having been arrested for holding up a sign that says ‘No war’.

An EU official said the bloc saw signs Russia might impose martial law: ‘As is the tragic loss of young lives killed in the military conflict, with Russian mothers having to learn about the loss of their sons. So it is something we're conscious of. And it’s something we're worried about,’ the official said.

Filippo Grandi, UN High Commissioner for Refugees, said the million refugees uprooted in seven days was one of the fastest exoduses he had seen in more than 40 years of emergency work.

‘Hour by hour, minute by minute, more people are fleeing the terrifying reality of violence.’

How will Russia invading Ukraine hit your cost of living? Tips to stop Putin wreaking havoc on your energy and petrol bills

by Toby Walne for the Mail On Sunday

Following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, The Mail on Sunday looks at the impact this conflict will have on your personal finances – and considers the budgeting steps you can take to mitigate it.

How will the invasion hit your cost of living?

The biggest change most households will notice is on their energy bills. With a cap on charges being lifted in April, we already expected average bills to rise 54 per cent to almost £2,000 a year.

Experts now predict that prices could rise again by a third – perhaps adding up to £700 to an average annual bill.

This will drip feed into gas and electric bills over the coming weeks and months. By October, we could be paying twice as much for our energy as we do now.

Impact: Petrol could rise to £1.70 a litre as the cost of crude oil soars.

Why are Britain's energy bills so badly affected?

The UK imports less than 5 per cent of its natural gas from Russia, so can survive without it thanks to gas reserves and other markets.

But our European allies are far more reliant – and unfortunately, the price for gas is affected by the global wholesale market.

Russia accounts for 65 per cent of Germany's natural gas imports and for the European Union the figure is 40 per cent.

Wholesale gas prices rose immediately by 13 per cent in Europe – and 9 per cent in the UK when the invasion started last week. Germany halted approval for a Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline from Russia.

What can we do to combat the energy bill hike?

Little in terms of combating soaring tariffs, lots in terms of making our homes more energy efficient. Better home insulation and less energy waste is a good starting point – these can cut bills by 15 per cent.

Begin by checking out your loft. Laying 10cm-thick insulation rolls over the entire attic floor will cost on average £250, but will pay for itself within a year thanks to the amount of heat no longer lost through the roof. Visit website Energy Saving Trust for advice on this and other ideas.

A £200 'discount' on energy bills will be paid automatically in instalments from October this year – plus a £150 council tax rebate for those in bands A to D.

What about prices at the petrol pumps?

The cost of unleaded petrol broke through £1.50 a litre last week. Unfortunately, it may not stop there and we could be heading towards £1.70 a litre.

Simon Williams, of motoring organisation RAC, says: 'The question now is at what price petrol will settle at and when? It will cause particular financial hardship for those relying on cars for work.'

Many will now pay more than £90 to fill up their petrol tank – £10 more than they might have paid to fill up at the start of this month.

Why is the impact on fuel prices so large?

Russia is one of the world's largest producers of crude oil – much of which gets refined into petrol and diesel.

While the majority of our oil comes from North Sea fields controlled by Britain and Norway, the cost – just like with gas – is dictated by the global market price.

The cost of a 159-litre barrel of crude oil soared past $105 following the invasion last week.

Last December, the price was close to $70 a barrel. Analysts now fear oil could rise to as high as $140 a barrel as supplies are disrupted due to the Russian conflict. Retailers will be quick to pass on any wholesale price hikes to motorists.

How can I lower my car fuel costs?

Motorists will have to plan their trips more carefully – and when they need to fill up, make sure they are not overpaying.

The difference between paying through the nose at a motorway service station or getting cheap fuel at a supermarket is as much as 20p a litre – the same as the extra amount we may have to pay at the petrol pumps as a result of the Russian invasion.

Free app PetrolPrices shows the price of petrol at local filling stations. Also, think about how you drive. Less aggressive driving will knock 25 per cent off your fuel bill.

Consider sharing car journeys with neighbours. Websites such as Liftshare can help commuters find people living nearby who are happy to share car journeys to and from work. Longer term, contemplate an electric vehicle.

Are there any other nasty surprises in store?

The price of groceries at the supermarket is expected to keep creeping up. Inflation is already 5.5 per cent but is likely to rise further in the coming months.

Maike Currie, investment director at fund manager Fidelity International, says: 'There are fears inflation of 7 per cent is on the horizon and could stay with us for a while. This will hit the poorest hardest.'

If we get 7 per cent inflation, a £40 weekly shop will become £43 for the same basket of goods. Ukraine is 'the breadbasket of Europe' – exporting 40 per cent of its grain.

Although this does not get sent to Britain, global supply restrictions to other markets could have an impact. The cost of imported pasta – which is made from wheat – could also go up.

Transport costs make up as much as 5 per cent of the cost of food – and will be hit by rising fuel prices. Plastics are made from crude oil and are used in everything – packaging, clothes and electric appliances – that will also rise in price.

Could it be less safe shopping online?

Security experts fear cyberattacks from Russia are on the horizon. GCHQ's National Cyber Security Centre is urging British firms to 'bolster their online defences'.

Problems that could occur include online banking being suspended and shopping websites going down.

There is also a fear that hackers could even try to infiltrate vulnerable computer systems and steal personal information.

There is no need to be alarmed – just be vigilant. Be wary of email attachments and do not click on links in unsolicited messages.

You can download free security software on to your computer from the likes of Avira and Sophos.

What about the cost of holidays abroad?

The airlines hedge the cost of aviation fuel, paying a price previously agreed rather than the current rate.

So there should not be an immediate impact on your holiday costs. But holidaymakers already face a 25 per cent rise this summer because of the rising cost of jet fuel and the Ukraine crisis can only add to this.

Higher energy, fuel and shopping bills are going to eat into your household budget. Perhaps now is the time to take stock of any vacation plans.

Some of the cash previously earmarked for a luxury break may now be needed for day-to-day spending. So consider a cheaper holiday.",Ukraine war: Hauliers demand ministers take action over record fuel prices,1
https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/mar/05/i-am-your-retribution-trump-rules-supreme-at-cpac-as-he-relaunches-bid-for-white-house,1,"Donald Trump turned back the clock to the darkest elements of his presidency on Saturday with a fiery address that showed the threat to American democracy is far from over.

After a lacklustre start to his campaign, Trump appeared to launch his White House bid in earnest with a vintage display of demagoguery that framed the 2024 election as “the final battle” for America.

The former president, wearing dark suit, white shirt and trademark red tie, also declared war on his own Republican party to the delight of ardent fans in the crowd chanting “Trump! Trump! Trump!” and “USA! USA! USA!”

Opinion polls suggest that Trump’s grip on the party is slipping in the wake of the 6 January 2021, insurrection and a disappointing midterm performance. But he continues to rule supreme at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC), billed as the biggest annual gathering of grassroots conservatives.

Feeding off the energy of a crowd that wore “Make America great again” (Maga) caps, and watched by Brazil’s far-right former president Jair Bolsonaro, Trump returned to the authoritarian language that characterised his political rise seven years ago.

“In 2016, I declared: I am your voice,” he said, speaking for just over 100 minutes from a bright blue and red stage in a cavernous ballroom at the closing speech of the CPAC event in Maryland. “Today, I add: I am your warrior. I am your justice. And for those who have been wronged and betrayed: I am your retribution,” he said.

Trump left office in disgrace after two impeachments and a failed attempt to overturn his defeat by Joe Biden in the 2020 election, culminating in a deadly riot at the US Capitol. He faces an array of criminal investigations yet announced another run for president last November at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida.

The subdued launch failed to deter rival Republicans rivals such as Nikki Haley, former ambassador to the UN, who has thrown her hat in the ring. Florida governor Ron DeSantis, seen as the most serious threat to Trump, opted out of CPAC and is instead meeting potential backers in California.

The mood at CPAC, held at a convention centre at the National Harbor in Maryland, was sluggish for much of the week but on Saturday night the 45th president drew by far the biggest and noisiest crowd. “I didn’t know this was a rally, Matt,” Trump said at one point to CPAC impresario Matt Schlapp. “It really is a rally.”

Perhaps stung by critics who say Trump has lost the swagger of his first campaign, Trump seemed determined to tap into supporters’ nostalgia and make the case that, together, they could rekindle the old magic. “For seven years you and I have been engaged in an epic struggle to rescue our country from the people who hate it and want to absolutely destroy it,” he said.

“We are going to finish what we started. We started something that was a miracle. We’re going to complete the mission, we’re going to see this battle through to ultimate victory. We’re going to make America great again.”

As the crowd erupted in cheers and chants of “Four more years!”, Trump cast the upcoming election in Manichean terms, returning to his us-versus-them rhetoric of old.

“With you at my side, we will demolish the deep state. We will expel the war mongers... We will drive out the globalists. We will cast out the communists. We will throw off the political class that hates our country … We will beat the Democrats. We will rout the fake news media. We will expose and appropriately deal with the Rinos [Republicans in name only]. We will evict Joe Biden from the White House. And we will liberate America from these villains and scoundrels once and for all,” he said.

Trump then sent a warning to the party that he has shaped in his own image in an effort to crush dissent. “We had a Republican party that was ruled by freaks, neocons, globalists, open border zealots and fools but we are never going back to the party of Paul Ryan, Karl Rove and Jeb Bush.”

In a zigzagging speech, Trump avoided references to DeSantis but repeatedly turned his fire on Biden. “This is the most dangerous time in our country’s history, and Joe Biden is leading us into oblivion,” he said.

Trump insisted that Russia’s Vladimir Putin decided to invade Ukraine because of the US’s botched withdrawal from Afghanistan in August 2021. “And you’re going to have world war three, by the way. We’re going to have world war three if something doesn’t happen fast. I am the only candidate who can make this promise: I will prevent world war three.”

He made the unlikely boast: “Before I arrive in the Oval Office, I will have the disastrous war between Russia and Ukraine ended... I know what to say.”

Trump threw red meat to the base: additional border wall construction and a massive increase in border patrols to stop the flow of illegal drugs, one day voting with paper ballots, a crackdown on trans rights and gender affirmation surgeries. He repeated his false claim that he won the 2020 election “by a lot” when in fact Biden beat him by 7m votes.

But before a cult-like crowd, Saturday’s event was a warning against Democratic complacency, an indicator that Trump is down but not out and that, just as in 2016, history could take a perilous turn. “We have no choice,” he said in a startling contrast to Biden’s pleas for unity, warning “this is the final battle”.

He concluded: “If we don’t do this, our country will be lost forever.”",‘I am your retribution’: Trump rules supreme at CPAC as he relaunches bid for White House,1

Footage widely shared online appeared to show an officer hitting a demonstrator in central London as crowds gathered in response to the Southport stabbings near Liverpool.

Police waded in before punching the man who was also kneed as he fell to the ground during the ugly scenes near Whitehall last night.

A clip has been posted on X, formerly Twitter, with the caption: 'Shocking footage shows Metropolitan Police walking up to a protester, minding his own business, and then violently punches him in the face and tackles him to the ground.'

It comes as a 17-year-old man accused of the Southport stabbings on Monday appeared in court and was publicly named for the first time.

Scotland Yard revealed 111 arrests were made during Whitehall riots over the Southport mass stabbing, after bottles, flares and fists rained down on officers.

The arrests were made for offences including violent disorder, assaults on police officers, possession of knives and offensive weapons and breach of protest conditions.

About 1,000 protesting yobs were condemned by the force as 'shameful' - as they accused them of exploiting the tragedy 'for their own violence and criminality'.

The Met's Assistant Commissioner Matt Twist said: 'Last night our officers faced unacceptable scenes of disorder and violence, as others across the country have done in recent days.

'They acted with great courage and the highest levels of professionalism in the face of hateful behaviour.

'All our thoughts should be with the victims and families of those impacted by the most dreadful attack in Southport. It is shameful that some have sought to exploit this tragedy as justification for their own violence and criminality.

'There is absolutely no place for this on our streets. We will ensure that anyone involved in any violent disorder and criminal behaviour will be stopped, arrested and will face justice.'

MailOnline has approached the Met for further comment on the footage of a man being punched.

A teenager charged with murdering three children and harming 10 others at a Taylor Swift-themed dance class in Southport was today named as Axel Rudakubana.

The 17-year-old, who turns 18 in just six days time, was born to Rwandan parents in Cardiff in 2006 before moving to the village of Banks in Lancashire in 2013.

He is accused of carrying out the attack that killed Bebe King, six, Elsie Dot Stancombe, seven, and Alice Dasilva Aguiar, nine.

Rudakubana is also accused of the attempted murders of eight more children, along with dance teacher Leanne Lucas, 35, and businessman John Hayes.

Up until now, the teenager's identity could not be revealed because suspects under 18 receive automatic anonymity in all UK court cases, except for in exceptional circumstances.

But after a successful application to the judge by the Mail, Rudakubana's name can now be reported.

Judge Andrew Menary KC said he had to balance the risk to the suspect's family and the risk to him in custody with the public interest accurately reporting his identity.

Far-right mobs took to the streets of Southport and and other major UK cities this week after a fake news website spread misinformation about the identity of the suspect.

Russian state media were among those falsely claiming that the suspect had arrived by boat to the UK last year, sharing claims that he was on an M16 watch list.

It led to violent riots, seeing dozens of police officers injured, wheelie bins set alight and emergency vehicles set on fire.

In a bid to quell tensions - after more riots broke out in London, Manchester Hartlepool, and Aldershot - Judge Menary revealed Rudakubana's identity.

As the suspected murderer arrived at the court he was met by dozens of people shouting, with one man having to be held back by police officers as the van holding him past.

The revelation comes as two children hurt in the attack were discharged from Alder Hey Children's Hospital, with five others in a 'stable condition'.

Honorary Recorder of Liverpool Judge Andrew Menary KC said he had to balance the risk to the defendant's family and the initial risk while in custody against the public interest in accurately reporting his identity.

He said: 'By continuing to prevent full reporting at this stage has the disadvantage of allowing others who are up to mischief to continue to spread misinformation in a vacuum and runs the risk that when the information becomes publicly available in six days' time, that will provide an additional excuse for a fresh round of public disorder.

'Allowing full reporting will undoubtedly remove some of the misreporting as to the identity of the defendant.'

A provisional trial date at Liverpool Crown Court, set to last six weeks, was scheduled for January 20 next year.

Rudakubana is next due to appear at Liverpool Crown Court on October 25 for a plea and trial preparation hearing and will be remanded in youth accommodation detention in the meantime.

London's 'Enough is Enough' protest yesterday marked the largest gathering of thugs in the UK this week.

Yobs took to the streets chanting the name of English Defence League founder Tommy Robinson and yelled 'stop the boats'.

https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-9267659/Donald-Trump-trashes-Mitch-McConnell-dour-sullen-unsmiling-political-hack.html,1,"Former President Donald Trump was convinced by aides to delete a line from his blistering attack on Mitch McConnell which accused the Senate minority leader of having ‘too many chins but not enough smarts’, according to reports.

Trump lashed out at McConnell on Tuesday through his Save America PAC, calling the Republican Party’s most senior elected figure a ‘dour, sullen’, ‘unsmiling political hack’ days after he voted to acquit Trump of inciting the Capitol riot but then blasted his conduct in an excoriating speech.

In his lengthy, racially-loaded and vitriolic statement issued from Mar-a-Lago, Trump also accused McConnell of ‘destroying’ the GOP and urged the party’s senators to end his leadership.

But the statement could have been even more cutting, if not for the intervention of Trump’s aides, Politico reported.

A source familiar with the matter told the outlet that Trump wanted to mock McConnell for having ‘multiple chins’, but advisors managed to talk him down.

‘There was also a lot of repetitive stuff and definitely something about him having too many chins but not enough smarts,’ the source said.

Trump's remarks about the Kentucky Republican were, however, still plenty harsh.

The former president blamed McConnell, whose office sits steps from where a large group of rioters were arrested on January 6, for causing the loss of two GOP Senate seats. Many GOP consultants and some elected officials have blamed Trump's own election overturn effort for costing the party control of the Senate.

'The Republican Party can never again be respected or strong with political 'leaders' like Sen. Mitch McConnell at its helm,' Trump began in a letter with his new stationary as the '45th President of the United States.

'McConnell's dedication to business as usual, status quo policies, together with his lack of political insight, wisdom, skill, and personality, has rapidly driven him from Majority Leader to Minority Leader, and it will only get worse,' he wrote.

'The Democrats and Chuck Schumer play McConnell like a fiddle—they've never had it so good—and they want to keep it that way! We know our America First agenda is a winner, not McConnell's Beltway First agenda or Biden's America Last.'

Blistering: How Trump released the extraordinary personal statement through his political action committee, which has received tens of millions of dollars since the election

End of any relationship: Mitch McConnell and Donald Trump were never personally close - but now the former president has launched a vendetta which threatens to tear apart their party

Statement from Florida: Donald Trump - last seen Monday saluting supporters near Mar-a-Lago sent the 622-word denunciation of the top-ranked Republican from his new home. Mitch McConnell voted to acquit Trump on Saturday, then savaged him on the Senate floor - setting off a cycle of vengeance and an open Republican civil war

Trump, who campaigned on China 'ripping off' the U.S., said McConnell had 'no credibility' on the issue – and even brought up a racially-loaded attack on his 'family's business substantial business holdings.'

McConnell's wife, Elaine Chao, served as Trump's Transportation secretary but resigned days after the Capitol riot. Her father James Si-Cheng Chao founded the family-held Foremost Group, which is involved in shipping and international trade, after leaving Taiwan in 1958.

'Likewise, McConnell has no credibility on China because of his family's substantial Chinese business holdings,' wrote Trump. He does nothing on this tremendous economic and military threat.' Trump's daughter, Ivanka has her own business relationships in China, and received government approval for patents while her father was in office.

Trump leveled personal attacks at McConnell amid a brewing civil war within the party – and threatened to support primary challenges to those he considers counter to the MAGA movement. Seven Republicans broke with Trump to join Democrats on impeachment.

Of those who did, several including Richard Burr of North Carolina and Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania faced immediate blowback from their state parties at home.

McConnell, 78, was just re-elected. Despite his own vote to acquit, he pointedly sided with House GOP Conference Chair Liz Cheney, who face an effort to strip away her leadership position after she voted to impeach Trump in the House.

'Mitch is a dour, sullen, and unsmiling political hack, and if Republican Senators are going to stay with him, they will not win again,' Trump predicted.

'He will never do what needs to be done, or what is right for our Country. Where necessary and appropriate, I will back primary rivals who espouse Making America Great Again and our policy of America First. We want brilliant, strong, thoughtful, and compassionate leadership.'

That was a two-edged threat, not directly to McConnell, who will not face a primary contest until 2026, but to any Senate Republicans who get out of line and also a threat to campaign in public for his chosen candidates in open seats.

The most high-profile of those is a touted run by Lara Trump, his daughter-in-law, for the North Carolina seat held by Richard Burr, who is not seeking re-election in 2022 and where a purple state narrowly won by Trump in 2020 will now be a primary battleground between the former president's family and the Republican establishment.

The statement was filled with personal invective - but while in office, Trump was considerably more laudatory as the procedural tactician helped push through tax cuts and a long line of Trump judicial nominations.

McConnell was infuriated by the Capitol riot and blasted Trump both before and after his impeachment. But his actions beyond simply his impeachment vote worked to insulate the president.

After House Democrats voted to impeach Trump in the riot's aftermath, McConnell did not join with Sen. Charles Schumer to bring the Senate back from recess. His staff said in a statement this weekend that his reasoning was that there would not have been time to complete an impeachment.

Regardless, it set the table for Trump's lawyers to argue on process grounds that the effort was unconstitutional – with McConnell and several colleagues saying they would not convict a president who was now out of office.

Trump's written broadside Tuesday came in lieu of the idea of a press conference at Mar-a-Lago. Such an event also might have subjected Trump to questions from the press, which he has not done since leaving office.

In his statement, Trump again pointed to his winning 'the most votes of any sitting President in history, almost 75,000,000,' rounding up from 74 million votes that he got.

He did not repeat his previous baseless claims that he won the election, nor did he mention that he trailed Joe Biden's 81 million votes.

It's personal: Trump's attack on McConnell included a racially-loaded claim that McConnell was compromised by 'his family's Chinese business holdings' - a reference to Elaine Chao, who as well as being the daughter of a Chinese-American businessman whose shipping company has made his family right, was Trump's transportation secretary until she quit in disgust after the MAGA riot

He took credit for the GOP's better-than-expected showing in November, where even some top Democratic prospects in North Carolina and other states failed to pan out. 'I single-handedly saved at least 12 Senate seats,' Trump wrote.

He blasted McConnell for failing to go along with an idea both Trump and Democrats backed for $2,000 checks in the final relief package. McConnell's caucus was resistant to that amount, finally coalescing around $600 checks.

After the assault, in a sign of how it was closely coordinated withing Trump's remaining orbit, Rudy Giuliani made an appearance on Steve Bannon's War Room show Tuesday night, to echo the insults.

It was only hours after Trump's own spokesman Jason Miller revealed that Giuliani had been dumped as his personal attorney, but the one-time New York mayor kept up the barrage of invective against the Republican minority leader.

'The man was treacherous, not only his vote but that whole unnecessary statement, which he knows is not true,' Giuliani said of the top Senate Republican. 'He knows that Donald Trump didn't organize that thing at Congress, come on, he organized it?'

Giuliani then ripped McConnell saying he was 'never interested' in the 'evidence' he collected that he claimed showed that the 2020 election was stolen from Trump due to widespread voter fraud. Dozens of courts rejected the claim and McConnell called the claims 'lies.'

'Mitch McConnell never asked to look at it, never cared,' Giuliani said. 'I can't say he refused, he never asked. He never asked to see it. How can you say it's all untrue when you haven't looked at it?'

McConnell had been publicly allied with Trump until the week of the Georgia run-offs, which cost the Kentucky Republican the Senate majority, and the riot, which happened the next day - but he had never endorsed his claims of election fraud, and had very publicly broken with Trump on them when the electoral college certified Joe Biden's victory.

'Look, Mitch McConnell represents Mitch McConnell and Washington, D.C. I don't even think he represents Kentucky. And he's part of the establishment, he might as well be Nancy Pelosi,' the former New York City mayor said.

'And I don't know what he's calculating or why he thinks this will keep him in power, but for some reason, I think, getting the Washington Post and The New York Times to write nice things about him is important,' Giuliani added.

McConnell is the most powerful member of the Senate, although his effort to navigate impeachment suggested he may have lacked the ability to cross the majority of his conference who were inclined to stick with Trump.

One fellow Republican, Sen. Ron Johnson, even denied this week that there was an armed insurrection in the Capitol.

McConnell, 78, wrote in the Wall Street Journal on Monday that he bore no ill will to the seven Republican senators who voted to impeach.

McConnell spelled out his reasons for voting to acquit - arguing that he felt the Constitution did not allow for impeaching a president who has already left office.

But, in a careful threading of the needle, he insisted he respected those who voted differently to him.

'I don't begrudge my colleagues their own conclusions,' he wrote. 'I respect senators who reached the opposite answer.' McConnell also reiterated his stinging criticism of Trump, who he is said to personally despise.

McConnell on Saturday, shortly after voting to acquit, accused Trump of 'a disgraceful dereliction of duty'.

On Monday he wrote: 'There is no question former President Trump bears moral responsibility. His supporters stormed the Capitol because of the unhinged falsehoods he shouted into the world's largest megaphone.

'His behavior during and after the chaos was also unconscionable, from attacking Vice President Mike Pence during the riot to praising the criminals after it ended.'

McConnell on Monday wrote an op-ed insisting his vote did not vindicate Trump

Sean Hannity used his Fox News show on Monday night to attack the Senate Minority Leader. The themes were echoed in Trump's statement Tuesday

Trump's tirade carries echoes of the attack launched on McConnell on Monday night by Fox News' Sean Hannity, one of the most passionate defenders of the former president. He accused McConnell of failing Trump when he was in office, and of failing to effectively attack Democrats for their own feisty rhetoric.

He also singled out John Thune, a Republican South Dakota senator, who like McConnell voted to acquit, then condemned Trump, saying: 'What former president Trump did to undermine faith in our election system and disrupt the peaceful transfer of power is inexcusable.'

In response Hannity said: 'Where was John Thune and Mitch McConnell fighting against the biggest abuse of power corruption scandal in our history with Operation Crossfire Hurricane?

'They were missing in action.

'Where's the sanctimonious Mitch McConnell, John Thune, demanding that Kamala Harris, Chuck Schumer, Nancy Pelosi, Maxine Waters - when is he going to give a speech on the Senate floor and hold those Democrats accountable for their incitement of insurrection and their insurrection-like language?

'The time is now coming for new leadership in the U.S. Senate.'

Three of the seven senators who voted to impeach - Richard Burr of North Carolina, Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, and Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania - have all been formally censured by their state parties for their vote.

Three more - Susan Collins of Maine, Mitt Romney of Utah, and Ben Sasse of Nebraska - could also be censured although in Romney's case the state party's leadership issued a statement of support of him and Mike Lee, who voted to acquit.

Hannity said the senators' guilty votes represent how 'way out of touch' they were with the Republican base, pointing to the immediate backlash in their home states.","Donald Trump trashes Mitch McConnell as 'a dour, sullen and unsmiling political hack'",1

Around 27 mobile homes parked up at Oakgrove School in Milton Keynes, Buckinghamshire, on Friday evening. They broke open the gate locks and refused entreaties to move on.

After a weekend of liaising with the local authority, the headteacher was forced to order the school's 2,000 pupils to study from home yesterday as the premises was deemed 'not safe'.

Then at around 4pm, a volley of police cars swooped on the site, with officers carrying helmets and batons to compel the illegal encampment to move on.

Although most caravans left without protest, two men were arrested by police - who attended the area with specially trained dogs, The Sun reports.

Police took action after the camp ignored a Section 60c Order instructing them to leave the site

One man led away by police is alleged to have threatened a photographer hours earlier, saying: 'If you put my picture in the papers, I’ll find you. It’s a small world.'

Oakgrove School is located in a quiet suburb of the newly designated city, with householders telling local media they were fearful after the caravans arrived on Friday.

Parents were left in an anxious state throughout the weekend, waiting for updates on whether the school would be open for pupils.

The Milton Keynes Citizen reported one mother who said: 'My husband just drove by Oakgrove and he says that it looks like there's 100s off them (travellers) and they were driving their cars in circles on their sports field behind the school.

'This is just disgusting. And police cannot do anything about this. They will destroy everything if they stay for a few days longer.'

Another person wrote: 'They have broken a water main and their kids are playing in the fountain.'

Bags of fly-ridden rubbish are also reported to have been left on the playing field.

A Thames Valley Police (TVP) spokesman said: 'Officers have been liaising with the school and engaging with those on the encampment. A Section 60c notice to leave was issued to those in the encampment with a deadline of 11am [Monday] morning.'

After the Section 60 notice was ignored, police stated they went on site to remove the encampment.

TVP's spokesman added: 'Our operation to remove an illegal encampment has concluded with a number of arrests and vehicles seized.'

In all, police seized four vehicles, three caravans and made two arrests, the spokesman added.

The school remains closed today while repairs are arranged for its gate locks, which are understood to have been broken on Friday.

Conservative MP for Milton Keynes North, Ben Everitt said: 'This is completely unacceptable, children should not lose a school day because they can't access their site.

https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/sep/24/cassidy-hutchinson-aide-january-6-hearings,1,"The former Donald Trump White House aide who became a pivotal January 6 witness remembers wanting to make a last-minute run for it before delivering her crucial testimony about the US Capitol attack that the defeated president’s supporters staged.

But Cassidy Hutchinson kept her nerve, and the cost of breaking ranks with Trump and his fanatical supporters was steep.

“Security protocols and … concerns” forced her out of her Washington DC apartment and into hiding after testifying, she said in an interview that aired on Sunday at 9am ET.

“My life changed – the way that I was living my life – for a while,” Hutchinson told CBS News Sunday Morning. “I could not go back to my apartment. I ended up moving down to Atlanta for several months.”

""I could not go back to my apartment.""

Hutchinson, who was working for Mark Meadows, Trump’s chief of staff, when January 6 occurred, also told CBS that she continues to consider herself a Republican. But she said she is not supporting Trump’s efforts to win the Republican nomination and return to the Oval Office in 2024 as he grapples with more than 90 criminal charges, many stemming from his attempts to overturn his electoral loss to Joe Biden weeks before the Capitol attack.

“I would … like to make clear – I would not back the former president of the United States,” Hutchinson remarked to CBS News Sunday Morning’s Tracy Smith during the interview. “He is dangerous for the country. He is willing – and has showed time and time again willingness – to proliferate lies, and to vulnerable American people, so he could stay in power.

“To me, that is the most un-American thing that you can do.”

Hutchinson – under subpoena – gave some of the most dramatic testimony about the Capitol attack during live congressional hearings in the summer of 2022. One key moment she described was how Trump accosted a Secret Service agent and lunged for the steering wheel of the car he was in when he was told he would not be driven to the Capitol.

The Capitol attack carried out by supporters whom Trump had told to “fight like hell” was a desperate but failed maneuver meant to prevent Congress from certifying Biden’s victory over him. The riot has been linked to nine deaths. More than 1,100 people have been charged in connection with the attack, and the majority of them have either pleaded guilty or been convicted by judges or juries.

Hutchinson explained on Sunday how it was a grueling decision to testify at the January 6 hearings conducted by a special House committee.

“I almost ran out of – there’s a little hold room outside the committee room – that we were about to walk in, and I almost darted,” Hutchinson told the program. “I heard the door click open, and I turned around and I looked at my attorney and said, ‘I can’t do this.’ And I started to walk, and he gently pushed my shoulders. And he said, ‘You can do this.’ And then we walked out.”

Hutchinson also said: “I felt torn … because I knew what I knew, and I wanted to come forward with what I knew. But at the same time, I didn’t want to feel like I was betraying … my colleagues.”

She recounted how she gained courage to speak up about her knowledge after researching the story of former Richard Nixon White House aide Alexander Butterfield. Butterfield testified at the Watergate scandal congressional hearings that helped bring about Nixon’s resignation in 1974.

Hutchinson’s interview was meant to promote her memoir, Enough, which was published by CBS’s sister company Simon & Schuster and is scheduled for release on Tuesday.

Enough has already attracted worldwide headlines after the Guardian reported that in it Hutchinson wrote about how she was groped by Rudy Giuliani – the Trump lawyer and former New York City mayor – on the day of the Capitol attack. The book mainly tracks the 27-year-old’s journey from Trump believer to disenchantment with him, echoing some of the comments Hutchinson made to CBS in Sunday’s interview.

Giuliani and Trump have pleaded not guilty to charges that they illegally sought to overturn Biden’s 2020 presidential election victory in the state of Georgia. The pair are among 19 people charged in the case brought by state prosecutors based out of Atlanta.

Those charges are contained in one of four criminal indictments filed against Trump this year. The others charge him for his retention of classified documents after leaving the White House, hush-money payments to the adult film actor Stormy Daniels and other efforts to nullify his 2020 defeat that culminated in the January 6 attack.

Long Centrelink queues formed in Sydney on Tuesday as workers applied for relief payments, with nearly 14 million Australians now living under some form of lockdown, prompting radio host Ben Fordham to warn the 'social and economic consequences' were now 'dwarfing' the damage from the virus.

Carrie Bickmore and fellow hosts of The Project also complained that Australia is now in a worse place than when the pandemic first hit 18 months ago, in stark contrast to the rest of the world.

Rashays co-founder Rami Ykmour, who was dramatically arrested in his office while defending staff from police enforcing Covid restrictions earlier this month, told Daily Mail Australia lockdowns were crippling small businesses.

Mr Ykmour called for more transparency regarding a road map out of Covid and more assistance for affected businesses and workers.

But his comments comes as new modelling by health experts warns NSW will likely remain in lockdown until the end of August or even longer.

Mr Ykmour (pictured with his partner) is calling on lawmakers to provide a clearer roadmap out of lockdown for the sake of Australia's mental health

'We all need to support the police and the government in what they are doing during Covid however our leaders need to lead with greater consultation with small business who are the backbone of the community and our country,' he said.

'Lockdown after lockdown is crippling business and has enormous effects on not just the mental health of the workers and mums and dads, but will deliver a knock-on negative effect for our children in the long term.'

One of the major challenges the restaurateur is facing is that his nationwide business has to abide by different lockdown restrictions in different areas.

Greater Sydney is enduring its fourth week of strict stay-at-home lockdown restrictions to slow the spread of the highly-contagious Indian Delta variant, while South Australia has brought in tough restrictions and Victoria is also in shutdown.

'We are in three different states, so there are three different rules in place, so it's like we are running three different businesses,' Mr Ykmour told Daily Mail Australia.

'Some allow dine-in others don't, some it's the four persons per sq/m rule, others aren't. So it's a massive challenge.'

The growing backlash against lockdowns comes as Melbourne endures its fifth shut down since the pandemic began (pictured, two women in the city on Tuesday)

Reflecting on this controversial arrest, Mr Ykmour said the ordeal was 'embarrassing' for himself and the business and that he is 100 per cent behind the police and the government

Mr Ykmour said another problem for the crippled hospitality industry is that stay-at-home orders are declared with very little notice for business owners.

'This pandemic did not start yesterday, there has been 18 months to prepare,' he said.

'When restrictions are called, we are not able to adjust our menu and we are left with perishable items that have to go in the bin, and obviously staff have their shifts cut.

'The emergency subsidy payments will help, but there are still major challenges.'

Ben Fordham (pictured, right) has lashed out at the NSW government's handling of Sydney's ongoing lockdown, while The Project's Carrie Bickmore (left) complained that Australia is now in a worse place than when the pandemic first began 18 months ago

His comments reflect a wider change in Australians' views towards lockdown as the primary way to handle coronavirus outbreaks.

Meanwhile, a medical expert has warned there's no guarantee NSW will reach its target of zero cases of community transmission.

UNSW epidemiologist Professor Greg Dore told 2GB breakfast radio host Ben Fordham on Wednesday 'it may not be feasible' this time.

'The key is uncertainty, Covid, if anything has shown is that lot of things are uncertain,' he told the program.

'I hope we do get back to zero transmissions but it may not be feasible.'

Professor Dore added that the Delta variant is different and more infectious than the previous Covid strains.

'Once it's very well established in the community and once you've got several hundred cases in the community, it will be tougher,' he said.

'We're getting 30-40 cases a day that haven't been in quarantine and have been in the community infectious.'

'Even though we're under lockdown circumstances, there are opportunities to pass the virus on, so that's concerning in terms of ongoing transmission.'

Professor Dore has urged everyone to get vaccinated and slammed health officials' campaign to undermine AstraZeneca jab, which he described as one of the most baffling public health disasters.

He described the AstraZeneca jab has highly effective.

'Anyone over the age of 18 can have AstraZeneca now,' Professor Dore said.

'A lot of young people have come forward to take up the option of AstraZeneca because the faster we can get population coverage with the vaccine, the sooner we can get out of this.'

'Right now the social and economic consequences of the lockdowns are dwarfing the damage of the virus', Fordham said (pictured, queues for Covid tests in Melbourne on Tuesday)

The Project hosts on Tuesday's program lamented that Australia is now in a worse position than at the same time last year, while the rest of the world is opening up and learning to live with the virus - albeit it with much higher vaccination rates.

Co-host Carrie Bickmore also weighed in and said it was disheartening the pandemic has had such a lasting impact on the country.

'If you said this time last year, we'd still be in this situation a year later, I just don't think anyone was imagining it,' she said.

'I'm sure the experts were, but I don't think everyday people were thinking that's how long this was going to go for.'

His comments come after radio host Ben Fordham joined calls for Australia to learn to live with Covid, with nearly 14 million residents in NSW, Victoria and SA now in lockdown.

The 2GB broadcaster slammed NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian on Tuesday morning over her insistence the state would not open up until community transmissions hit zero.

'We are seeing very little change in the daily case numbers. They want us to focus on the number of people who are infectious while in the community. We're not really making a dent on that number,' Fordham said.

'And yet the government reckons that that number needs to be close to zero before we can open up. Come off it. How're we going to get there?

'And at what point do we start showing some courage? Right now the social and economic consequences of the lockdowns are dwarfing the damage of the virus.'

Sydney is enduring its tightest restrictions since the pandemic began in March last year, with even tradies unable to work.

'Why don't we get fair dinkum and work towards the Premier's goal of learning to live with the virus,' Fordham added.

'We have the harshest restrictions of any state since coronavirus arrived. Kids aren't at school, small businesses are on their knees, if you live in Fairfield, Liverpool or Canterbury, you cannot leave the area for work unless you are an authorised worker,' he said.

'And now more than a quarter of a million construction workers and tradies are out of a job. It's never happened anywhere in Australia. They didn't even do it in Victoria, during their darkest days… this cannot go on.'

The outbreak of infections that began in Sydney's eastern suburbs on June 16 has now reached 1,418 infections (pictured, Liverpool in Sydney's south-west, the new epicentre of the infections, on Tuesday)

But new modelling from Melbourne University led by epidemiologist Professor Tony Blakely suggests it's likely to take at least five more weeks for Sydney's daily case number to drop below five a day, news.com reported.

This means lockdown could last until at least the end of August.

'The Delta variant has been a game changer,' Prof Blakely said.

'It is harder to control and eliminate, and makes policies other than hard lockdown very uncertain and hard to predict.'

He said if NSW had not brought in even harsher lockdown restrictions, it could have taken 27 weeks for infection rates to stabilise.

Melbourne University's modelling also lines up with similar scenarios played out by Burnet Institute and epidemiologist Professor Michael Toole, who estimated that Sydney will not see the end of lockdown until at least August.

Prof Toole said it took six weeks for Victoria to get from 100 cases a day down to zero last year, and that was without the highly infectious Indian Delta variant.

During the Stage Four lockdown in Victoria last year, which lasted 112 days, tradies were able to work throughout with sensible Covid-safe practices in place.

Tradies are unable to work in the Greater Sydney area but are also unable to travel into regional New South Wales.

One Sydney construction boss who had to stand down 200 building site workers under strict new rules revealed on Tuesday he was visited by police over unfounded fears he was trying to incite a riot.

Peter Khayat, from Sydney's south, made a series of Facebook posts on Monday saying: 'Am I the only one thinking it's time we fought for our basic human rights?'

He also made posts supporting anti-lockdown protests which have broken out in Bankstown, in Sydney's south-west, since the area was put under tighter restrictions last week.

In a series of Facebook posts he appeared to call for an uprising against the government over the lockdown.

'Time to riot... freedom is not free. The time now is now brother,' Mr Khayat posted on Facebook.

'Bankstown the lebos are in full riot. Freedom is not free!''

Shortly after the posts, a convoy of trucks caused havoc on the Anzac Bridge on Saturday (pictured above) afternoon with similar scenes at the Harbour Bridge.

A few hours later, Mr Khayat opened the door of his home to three NSW Police officers after they received a tip-off about his posts.

In a series of video clips Mr Khayat published on his TikTok, police said they were told about his comments and were doing their 'due diligence'.

But Mr Khayat insisted: 'You just wanted to make sure I wasn't going to storm the government buildings? I don't even know where the government buildings are...'

Daily Mail Australia contacted NSW Police. Mr Khayat declined to comment.

NSW recorded 78 new Covid-19 cases overnight on Tuesday, but 27 were still out in the community while infectious - a number being used by health officials to determine whether lockdown can be eased.

Premier Berejiklian warned residents in the hotspot Liverpool, Canterbury-Bankstown and Fairfield local government areas they could be carrying the virus even if they have no symptoms.

She said more than two-thirds of the state's new cases were still being found in those three regions.

Officials also confirmed a woman in her 50s had died from Covid-19 in Sydney's south-west; she is the mother of two removalists who travelled to regional NSW while infected with the virus.

Of the 49 linked cases, 45 are household contacts and 4 are close contacts.

The 78 positive results in the 24 hours to 8pm on Monday night came from 62,860 tests. NSW Health said 29 of the new infections have yet to be linked to known cases.

The outbreak of infections that began in Sydney's eastern suburbs on June 16 has now reached 1,418 infections.

'If you are living in a community that has a lot of cases, even if you don't have symptoms, don't assume you don't have the virus,' Ms Berejiklian said.

'In communities where the virus is lurking, where the virus is circulating, you could have the virus, not know it and unfortunately take it home and give it to your loved ones.'

Anti-lockdown tensions are continuing to rise, particular in Sydney's south-west, the new epicentre of Sydney's outbreak.

Demonstrators over the weekend even clashed with police resulting in four men being arrested.

Premier Berejiklian tightened lockdown rules in the councils of Fairfield, Liverpool and Canterbury on Saturday due to disproportionately high case numbers of the highly infectious Indian Delta variant in those areas.

But the rise in cases didn't stop about 40 furious residents from taking to the streets claiming the south-west was 'unfairly targeted' by the strengthened rules.

Protesters directed their anger at Ms Berejiklian chanting 'Freedom, Freedom', 'No to the vaccine', and 'f**k off Gladys' as they marched through Paul Keating Park at about 5pm on Sunday.

Fiery photos show men, women and teenagers marching with a mega phone, and mostly without face masks, coming up against police who tried continually to quell the demonstration.

Giuliani's home was surrounded by FBI agents at 6am on Wednesday morning, as part of an investigation into his dealings in Ukraine.

Giuliani, the former US Attorney for the Southern District of New York, and former mayor of NYC, told Fox News host Tucker Carlson on Thursday night that there was no legal justification for the raid.

'The only way you can get a search warrant is if you can get that evidence someone will destroy evidence,' said Giuliani.

He said that he had been offering his electronic devices for two years, and claimed that the government had 'spied on me' before, through the Cloud.

'I could have destroyed the evidence years ago. I didn't destroy the evidence because the evidence is exculpatory. It proves that the the president and I are innocent,' he said.

They seized 'eight electronic devices of mine and two of someone else's,' he said.

'There is no justification for that warrant,' Giuliani continued.

'It's an illegal, unconstitutional warrant.'

The warrants included an allegation that Giuliani failed to register as a foreign agent, a violation of lobbying laws.

Prior to the 2020 presidential election, Giuliani led an effort to dig up dirt on then-Democratic contender Joe Biden and his son Hunter in Ukraine.

Rudy Giuliani's Upper East Side home was raided at 6am on Wednesday

Giuliani insisted on Carlson's show that he had never worked for any foreign nationals, and had a line in all his contracts insisting he would only work for U.S. citizens.

'I never, ever represented a foreign national,' said Giuliani, who founded management consultancy and security firm Giuliani Partners in 2002, on stepping down as mayor.

Giuliani accused agents of ignoring Hunter Biden's hard drives during their search - hard drives which contained the image above

'I have in my contracts that I didn't want to,' he said.

He worked on behalf of a wide range of foreign clients, from the Qatari government in 2007, for whom he acted as a security consultant, to a $4.3 million security contract with Mexico City, advising them on their policing and public safety.

Giuliani said that investigators would not tell him what exactly they were looking in to.

'They won't explain what they are looking into for the last two years,' he said.

'They won't address it. They say come in and discuss your entire life.'

And he expressed bemusement that the 'very professional' agents were not interested in taking Hunter Biden's hard drive with them.

'I said don't you want these?' Giuliani recalled.

'They said what are they? I said they are Hunter Biden's hard drives.'

The agents said they did not want them.

'I said, are you sure? One last time. They said no.'

Giuliani said that Hunter Biden's hard drives 'fall in the scope of the subpoena'.

He said the hard drive contained evidence of '30 years of the Biden crime family'.

Giuliani added: 'They were also completely content to rely on my word. They could have been Donald Trump's. They could have been Vladimir Putin's.'

Giuliani concluded: 'I am so offended by the things they have said about me.'

Earlier on Thursday, Giuliani had told a caller to his radio show that he was outraged at the raid, and described those behind it as 'crooks' jealous of his career.

'I've been fighting crooks all my life,' he said.

'I'm fighting crooks again. The only tragedy of it is they have titles from the government.

'But they're a disgrace! They are a complete disgrace to the office that I distinguished! They didn't.'

Giuliani then detailed his illustrious career, telling how he expelled 'five Nazis' from the United States and talking about his infamous mob-busting years in the 1980s, when he brought down the 'Five Families' - New York's main mafia clans.

'Did they get threatened with getting killed by the mafia? The Colombian cartel wanting to cut my throat?

'What have they done? Noting except come after me, six-o-clock in the morning, with a piece of nonsense. No wonder they're jealous!

'It's just ridiculous.'

The comments are Giuliani's first on the raid, aside from a written statement released via his lawyer on Wednesday.

Donald Trump on Thursday slammed the FBI raid on 'patriot' Giuliani's Manhattan apartment, saying it is 'very unfair'.

The former president spoke out to defend his former personal attorney, telling Fox Business host Maria Bartiromo: 'Rudy Giuliani is a great patriot. He just loves this country, and they raid his apartment.

Michael Cohen: Giuliani is an 'idiot' who will turn on Trump - and Trump will not hesitate to 'throw him under the bus' Michael Cohen has said Rudy Giuliani 'would give Donald Trump up in a heartbeat' after federal agents raided the former New York City mayor's home and office. Speaking to CNN Thursday, Trump's former fixer called Giuliani an 'idiot' who has 'no relationship' with the ex president, who, he says, operates in a 'garbage can orbit'. Federal agents raided the 76-year-old's apartment Wednesday, taking with them his electronic devices including computers and cellphones. After news of the raid broke Wednesday, Cohen - who was also subject of a federal raid and would eventually plead guilty to eight federal counts - tweeted: 'Here we go folks.' He said Thursday: 'He's [Giuliani] nervous and rightfully so. Rudy will give up Donald in a heartbeat. Donald will throw anyone and everyone under the bus. 'Rudy has been shady for a long time. 'We have no idea how expansive this investigation is going to ultimately reveal itself, because Rudy's an idiot. And that's the problem. 'Rudy drinks too much. Rudy behaves in such an erratic manner, that, who knows what's on those telephones or what's on his computers?' Cohen was convicted in 2018 of campaign finance violations while working as Trump's personal attorney – he was sentenced to three years in prison after pleading guilty to nine charges. Less than a year after his sentencing, Cohen was released from Otisville Correctional Facility in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic on compassionate grounds. He has been confined to his Trump Park Avenue apartment in Lenox Hill ever since July 2020. Advertisement

'It's like so unfair and...it's like a double standard like I don't think anybody's ever seen before. It's very, very unfair. Rudy is a patriot who loves this country.'

Joe Biden later said he found out about the raid 'when the rest of the world learned about it', adding: 'I had no idea this was underway.'

The raid signals a major escalation of the Justice Department's investigation into any possible violation of federal lobbying laws and the business dealings of Giuliani.

Giuliani, once celebrated for his handling of the 9/11 terror attacks while New York City mayor, has been under federal scrutiny for several years over his ties to Ukraine. The dual searches sent the strongest signal yet that he could eventually face federal charges.

Giuliani's lawyer Robert Costello said the warrants involved an allegation that Giuliani failed to register as a foreign agent and that investigative documents mentioned John Solomon, a frequent Fox News commentator with close ties to Giuliani.

Solomon pushed baseless or unsubstantiated allegations involving Ukraine and Biden during the 2020 election. His former employer, The Hill, published a review last year of some of his columns and determined they were lacking in context and missing key disclosures.

Trump said on Thursday: 'I don't know what they're looking for or what they're doing.

'They say it had to do with filings of various papers and lobbying files. Well, did Hunter [Biden] file? Did [President] Biden file? Because they did a lot of work with other countries. To the best of everyone's knowledge, they didn't file.

'It's a very, very unfair situation.'

He added: 'It is so terrible when you see the things going on in our country with the corruption and the problems and then they go after Rudy Giuliani. It's very said, actually.'

He ended the interview by telling Bartiromo: 'You're going after the Rudy Giuliani's of the world when you have rapists and murderers coming in through the border.'

The raid may have been spurred by a voicemail where the former mayor of New York City hinted at having a burner phone.

Federal investigators may have been alerted over a November 2019 message Giuliani left his ex associate Lev Parnas in November 2019.

Giuliani is said to have been recorded saying: 'Joe, it's Rudy Giuliani.

'I'm calling, uh, to see if we can talk either about or with Lev. I have my lawyer with me, but you can call me back at [REDACTED]. That's [REDACTED].'

Giuliani then adds: 'That's the soon to be gotten rid of number.'

Joseph Bondy, the attorney for Parnas, filed a motion in court in December that included a transcript of the voicemail message that the ex-mayor left him.

https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/aug/23/proud-boys-leader-enrique-tarrio-sentenced-black-lives-matter,1,"The leader of the Proud Boys extremist group was sentenced to more than five months in jail for burning a Black Lives Matter banner that had been torn down from a historic Black church and for bringing two high-capacity firearm magazines into the nation’s capital days before the 6 January Capitol attack.

Although government prosecutors had requested that Enrique Tarrio receive a sentence of three months in jail after pleading guilty, a District of Columbia judge on Monday said that punishment was insufficient.

“Mr Tarrio has intentionally and proudly crossed the line from peaceful protest and assembly to dangerous and potentially violent criminal conduct,” Judge Harold Cushenberry said at the sentencing hearing, adding that Tarrio had “betrayed” democratic values.

The judge said that Tarrio’s expressions of remorse and his claims that he had not fully realized what he was doing were “not credible” and in some cases contradicted by video evidence.

Tarrio was arrested on 4 January while on his way to Washington DC, two days before thousands of supporters of Donald Trump, including prominent members of the Proud Boys, descended on the US Capitol and disrupted the certification of the electoral college vote.

Police had pulled Tarrio over on a warrant for vandalizing a Black Lives Matter sign stolen from the Asbury United Methodist church in downtown DC the previous month.Authorities said the banner had been stolen by Proud Boys membersand set ablaze using lighter fluid. Tarrio had posted a picture of himself holding an unlit lighter on the social media platform Parler and admitted days later in an interview with the Washington Post that he joined in the burning of the banner.

When police pulled Tarrio over, officers found two unloaded magazines emblazoned with the Proud Boys logo in his bag. Tarrio said, according to a police report, that he sells the clips and the ones he was carrying were purchased by a customer. Tarrio was quickly released but ordered to stay away from Washington, and law enforcement later said he had been picked up in part to help quell potential violence.

Tarrio pleaded guilty last month to destruction of property and attempted possession of a large-capacity ammunition feeding device. A police spokesman told the Associated Press in December that investigators were investigating the events as potential hate crimes, but no hate crime charges were filed.

In Monday’s hearing, the Rev Ianther Mills, the senior pastor of Asbury United Methodist church, described the “stress, anxiety, frustration, anger and terror” her congregation experienced as a result of seeing their church’s banner destroyed by a mob of violent men roaming through Washington, and then seeing how videos of its destruction were shared and celebrated on social media.

The banner-burning was reminiscent of “visions of slavery, the Ku Klux Klan, lynchings and their public spectacle, cross-burnings”, Mills told the court.

“This was deliberate and planned,” she said. “Who carries a bottle of lighter fluid to a peaceful demonstration?”

Tarrio’s lawyer, Lucas Danise, said his client was “extremely sorry” for what he had done and that the Proud Boys leader “wasn’t thinking clearly”. He asked the court to sentence Tarrio to community service in Florida in lieu of jail time.

Tarrio himself, clean-shaven and wearing glasses, told the court that he was sorry for his actions, calling them a “grave mistake”.

He addressed Mills directly, saying that he wanted to “apologize profusely” to her.

“I heard the grief in her voice,” Tarrio said. “What I did was wrong.”

Tarrio’s remarks in court were markedly different from the recent posts on his Telegram channel, which claimed the weekend before his sentencing that he was planning to appear at a far-right rally in Portland on Sunday that turned violent, and included a photograph of riot gear, including a gas mask and a tactical vest with the Proud Boys logo, with the caption, “Let’s rock!”

Cushenberry, a Reagan appointee, said that Tarrio’s claims that he had not realized what he was doing were not believable, and that his previous criminal history should also be taken into account.

Tarrio “could not have cared less about the laws of the District of Columbia”, Cushenberry said during the sentencing. “He cared about himself and self promotion.”

The judge also criticized government prosecutors for failing to properly document the costs the church incurred to hire private security in the wake of its targeting by Tarrio and other Proud Boys, and said he could not require Tarrio to pay more than $5,000 in restitution for those security costs because of the lack of documentation from the prosecutors.

Tarrio’s sentencing comes as authorities have narrowed in on the Proud Boys and other extremist groups, such as the Oath Keepers, in their investigation into the 6 January attack on the Capitol that sent lawmakers running and injured dozens of law enforcement officers. Members of the Proud Boys face some of the most serious charges among the more than 600 people being prosecuted in connection with the insurrection.

About three dozen people charged have been identified by federal authorities as Proud Boys leaders, members or associates. In one case, four group leaders have been charged with conspiring to impede the certification of Joe Biden’s election victory. Tarrio has not been charged in the Capitol attack.

Meanwhile, Proud Boys have continued to engage in volatile, violent street demonstrations, including in Portland and Los Angeles.

It was revealed in court records recently that Tarrio had worked undercover and cooperated with investigators after he was accused of fraud in 2012. After Tarrio’s 2012 indictment for participating in a scheme involving the resale of diabetic test strips, he helped the government prosecute more than a dozen other people, the records show.",Proud Boys leader gets five months for burning BLM banner and weapons crimes,1

The letter accuses Bowser of contributing to the 'decline' of the city, which has been experiencing an economic boom in recent years – but has seen a spike in homelessness and shootings, as part of a nationwide trend.

'As violent crime and homelessness have increased at an unchecked rate throughout the city, your administration seems to have given up trying to prevent the District from falling into a state of chaos,' the lawmakers wrote.

House Republicans on the Oversight Committee have written Mayor Muriel Bowser about homelessness and crime in the city

The letter points to the September shooting of Tarshaqua Chappell, 37, of Temple Hills, Md., who was shot inside her car with a small child in the back seat.

DC has a long and contentious history with Congress, which used to exert more direct control over city affairs. The panel is run by Democrats, but is certain to clash more with the city over 'home rule' issues if Republicans take over the House.

The lawmakers also reference tent encampments in parks around the city that are visible to visitors and locals alike, Fox News reported.

'The message coming from your office regarding the future role of, and funding for, the city’s police is contributing to the decline,' the lawmakers wrote. 'As the committee of jurisdiction for all matters involving the District of Columbia, House Committee on Oversight and Reform Republicans request information regarding this dangerous trend in the nation’s capital.'

The swats at DC come months after the House passed a bill to grant DC statehood in April, although the measure faces long odds in the Senate. The city is heavily Democratic in registration, and residents have long clamored for representation for its nearly 700,000 citizens.

'Tent cities are scattered throughout the District for any tourist or commuter to see,' they wrote. Many lawmakers fall into the commuter variety, visiting Washington during the work week before returning to their districts

The letter also mentioned a homeless encampment downtown.

'Earlier this year, residents of Mount Vernon Square wrote to the U.S. Park Police requesting homeless encampments be removed, pointing to various criminal and sanitary violations from the inhabitants,' they wrote, noting that it was denied, 'and the District’s homeless population grows.'

'Tent cities are scattered throughout the District for any tourist or commuter to see,' it says.

The city embraced the themes of protesters after George Floyd protests broke out in 2020, painting 'Black Lives Matter' on a street near the White House.

A more permanent Black Lives Matter Plaza is now under construction just across Pennsylvania Avenue from the White House, with the slogan spelled out in brick and concrete.

There were hardened criminals and baby-faced schoolboys, some with the support of parents and others without.

“He’s a pain in the arse,” said one defendant’s longsuffering dad. The father of another told reporters his teenage son was “a moron”.

The Guardian reported from courts across the north of England every day this week as more than 302 people – aged 14 to 69 – nationwide faced a legal reckoning that was as severe as it was swift.

Hundreds more are expected to be sent to custody in the coming weeks as the number of those arrested reached 741 on Friday evening, with suspected offences including violent disorder, arson, assault of emergency workers and inciting racial hatred.

The response of the courts followed the worst outbreak of public disorder in Britain in more than a decade as far-right demonstrations turned violent after the killing of three young girls – Bebe King, six, Elsie Dot Stancombe, seven, and Alice Dasilva Aguiar, nine – at a Taylor Swift-themed holiday club in Southport last week.

Judges who would usually reserve shrinking prison spaces for the most serious offenders sent 80% of riot suspects to the cells to await trial – with the total at more than 120 by Friday. The minority who were allowed bail were almost all young.

Keir Starmer praised the “robust and swift response” of the criminal justice system, saying judges should “send a very powerful message to anybody involved, either directly or online, that you are likely to be dealt with within a week”. He added: “Nobody, but nobody, should be involved themselves in this disorder.”

In many cases, solicitors for the alleged rioters denied their clients were racist or anti-immigrant. One lawyer said the men in the dock “do not know the difference between far right and far left”.

The longest prison sentence was reserved for Derek Drummond, 58, who was jailed for three years after pleading guilty to punching a police officer in the face at a far-right rally outside Southport mosque, an hour after he had attended a vigil for the young girls who were killed.

His wife winced in the public gallery as police bodycam footage showed him squaring up to riot police and shouting “Shithouses! Shithouses!” before attacking one of them.

Drummond, who had 14 previous convictions, handed himself in to police four days after the incident. In an interview, he told officers he had been “a fool”, adding: “I’m absolutely ashamed by the way I’ve acted. I’ve let Southport down, I’ve let the kids down, and I’ve let myself down.”

While Drummond was one of many defendants with a history of violence, a significant number had no criminal records.

Liam Grey, 20, had “never been in trouble in his life” until he was charged with violent disorder after the Rotherham riot, in which a group tried to set fire to a Holiday Inn Express housing asylum seekers on Sunday, his solicitor Chris Wong told Sheffield magistrates court.

Wearing a prison-issued grey tracksuit, Grey, who pleaded not guilty, was led to the cells in tears after being refused bail – like each of the adult defendants before the judge that day. He blew a kiss to his mother who, appearing emotional, shouted: “You’ll be all right, Liam, love.” He faces another hearing on 20 August.

Many of those in court were not the “ordinary people with legitimate concerns” as characterised by Tommy Robinson, the anti-Islam activist who has been accused of amplifying the unrest from his Ayia Napa sunlounger.

The youngest of the people charged so far is a 14-year-old boy, who was charged after allegedly aiming a firework at officers in Liverpool. The oldest to appear in court was 69-year-old William Nelson Morgan. He looked despondent in the dock, blinking rapidly and occasionally looking down at the floor as he was jailed for two years and eight months after pleading guilty.

It was clear he had never expected to end up in a courtroom, let alone prison, after taking part in what the judge described as “very serious mob violence” armed with a wooden cosh. It had taken three officers to arrest the retired welder, a widower, who shouted “I’m fucking 70!” as he was being detained, prompting one officer to inquire: “Well, why are you at a fucking riot?”

At Middlesbrough’s eerily beautiful 1970s magistrates court building, it was so busy on one day that three courtrooms were given over to hear the tales of 28 alleged rioters. The defendants were aged 16-56, all of them local to the area. Almost all were accused of violent disorder after rioting in the town and in nearby Hartlepool.

Time and again defence solicitors applied for bail. He cares for his partner who has cancer, said one. He is effectively carer to his parents, said another. He has no previous convictions, said others. Each time the submissions were quickly rejected by a district judge.

Solicitors repeatedly said their clients denied being part of the violence, that they were in the wrong place at the wrong time and would be maintaining their innocence in trials that will probably not take place until at least February next year.

One of those pleading not guilty was Lennon Chisholm, 21, of Middlesbrough, who sobbed uncontrollably throughout his appearance and was passed a tissue by his solicitor, David Dedman.

“When things are rushed, mistakes can be made,” Dedman said to the district judge, Marie Mallon, as he applied for bail. It was refused.

There were other outcomes. A 16-year-old who is autistic was accused of smashing car windows with an axe, which he denied. He was remanded into local authority care because, the court heard, of his vulnerability and fears for him should he go to Wetherby young offender institution.

The cases provided a glimpse into what police faced during the violence. People were accused of throwing bricks, a scaffolding pole and pushing a blazing wheelie bin at police lines.

Prosecutors said Thomas Rodgers, 22, who said he was homeless, was part of a group of 30 throwing rocks and bricks at police. “I hope your kids get raped,” he had told officers. “I’m glad I threw rocks.” He was denied bail.

Another defendant was accused of yelling at police while swigging from a can of lager: “We are taking over, I fucking hate you.”

It must have been a surreal experience for some at court that day. One Muslim solicitor had two days earlier been helping to protect a mosque. On Tuesday he was defending someone accused of being involved in violence against the police.

It got so busy at Teesside that a court 40 miles away in South Shields was also used to deal with the defendants. By 7pm things were wrapping up, with more cases expected the next day. And the next.","Tears, denials and excuses: a week in court amid far-right riots in England",1

A civil lawsuit filed on behalf of Babbitt's husband Aaron Babbitt on June 1 alleges the Metropolitan Police Department failed to comply with a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request by missing a May 12 deadline to either provide him with the records or notify him that he would not be given access to them.

The lawsuit states that the FOIA request was submitted on April 21, days after the Department of Justice concluded that the unnamed police officer did not use excessive force against Babbitt in her death.

It comes after sources have said the officer went into hiding for fear of his safety after he was placed on administrative leave in January shortly after the shooting.

Video footage from the riots showed Babbitt (top right) trying to enter the Speaker's Lobby through the broken door before she was shot by an officer whose name has not been disclosed

Babbitt family attorney Terrell Roberts told CNBC the purpose of the lawsuit is to uncover records about the shooting - including the name of the officer responsible - and the investigation that followed.

It is separate from a $10million wrongful death lawsuit Roberts said he planned to file on behalf of Babbitt's family last month.

Ashli Babbitt's family have said they will file a $10million wrongful death suit against the Metropolitan Police Department

The Metropolitan Police Department's Internal Affairs Division, along with two other civil rights offices within the US Attorney's Office conducted the investigation, the Department of Justice announced in mid-April, by sifting through video footage posted to social media, Babbitt's autopsy results and statements from the officer who fired the gun as well as others who were on the scene.

'Based on that investigation, officials determined that there is insufficient evidence to support a criminal prosecution,' the Department of Justice reported.

'Specifically, the investigation revealed no evidence to establish that, at the time the officer fired a single shot at Ms. Babbitt, the officer did not reasonably believe that it was necessary to do so in self-defense.'

Roberts, however, disagreed with that assessment.

'The actual evidence is this: the officer shot an unarmed woman who was not an immediate threat to him or any member of Congress,' Roberts previously told CNBC. 'That is inconsistent with any claim of self-defense or the defense of others, period.'

He said he and the family 'strongly disagree with the U.S. Attorney's decision, but we are not dissuaded from our goal of ultimately vindicating Ashli Babbitt's constitutional rights in the civil arena.'

The officer is reportedly in hiding for fear of his safety, sources told RealClearInvestigations in April, as the mystery surrounding the shooting fueled rumors as to the true identity of Babbitt's killer.

He has been on administrative leave since January 7, the Capitol Police announced.

Babbitt, a 35-year-old Air Force veteran, was one of hundreds of former-President Donald Trump supporters who stormed the Capitol on January 6 in an effort to prevent Congress from certifying the results of the 2020 presidential election.

Babbitt, and Air Force veteran, was among hundreds of Trump supporters who stormed the US Capitol on Jan. 6

They started at a rally nearby, and broke-into the Capitol, breaching perimeters set by the Capitol Police Department, shortly after Trump told his followers they should pressure Republicans not to accept the results of the election.

According to the Department of Justice, Babbitt was part of a group of protestors that managed to force their way into a hallway outside the Speaker's Lobby, which leads directly to the House Chamber.

She tried to climb head-first through the broken glass window of a door separating the hallway from the lobby, which was barricaded from the inside with furniture, the department claimed in mid-April, following its investigation into Babbitt's death.

Other members of the group tried to break through the doors 'by striking them and breaking the glass with their hands, flagpoles, helmets and other objects,' the Department of Justice said, and the US Capitol Police had to evacuate members of Congress stuck inside.

One of the officers inside the lobby then fired one round from his service pistol, the department said, striking her once in her left shoulder, and causing her to fall backward onto the floor.

An emergency response team was deployed to tend to her wounds, the department concluded, before she was transported to Washington Hospital Center, where she was pronounced dead.

Babbitt has since become a martyr for Trump supporters, with some raising over $90,000 for a memorial to her, and a pro-Babbitt group clashing with Breonna Taylor supporters in California over the weekend.

An initial scheduling conference for the lawsuit is scheduled for September 3.

Wheeler was dining outdoors with a companion when the protesters walked up to him and began shouting obscenities at the Democratic mayor.

Portland made national news when riots hit the city for more than 100 nights in a row last summer as Black Lives Matter protesters clashed with police in response to the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis last May.

What began with calls to defund the police and reinvest in communities spiraled into anti-government demonstrations, including calls for Wheeler's resignation.

The video shows Wheeler dining at Café Nell's in Northwest Portland when he is approached by a group of protesters.

Portland endured more than 100 nights of rioting during last summer's protest over racial inequality and police brutality the ramifications of which are still raw

A person off-camera can then be heard yelling at the mayor who remains calm throughout the video addressing him by his middle name Tevis.

Wheeler asks the person yelling at him how old he is before telling him he needs to grow up.

'You are going to be made to feel like the scum you are,' the protester says in the video. 'F*** you! F*** you! Shame on you!'

'I think you need to do your job as a f***ing mayor. I think you're a disgrace,' he replies after Wheeler says that he thinks the group should leave. 'How dare you do sweeps when people are still on the streets.'

'You think that we're going to forget about you? We're never going to forget you, Tevis. Ever. Ever. I hope you enjoyed your little wine... you're f*****, Tevis.'

Tracy Molina, a prominent Portland activist, confronted Mayor Ted Wheeler and allegedly punched him

Jim Middaugh, a spokesman for the mayor, told The Oregonian the hecklers 'pushed their way past restaurant employees' to confront Wheeler while he was dining.

Although the mayor asked the group to leave 'at that point, one member of the group started swatting the mayor and made physical contact with him', Middaugh said.

The punch was not captured on video although Wheeler managed to take a photograph of the woman he claimed hit him.

The woman, Tracy Molina, is a prominent social justice activist and regularly participates in the city's protests against police violence and systemic racism.

The mayor did not press charges and no arrests were made. His office released a statement regarding the incident.

The video was posted to Twitter by citizen journalist Cozca Itzpapaloti

The statement said: 'On Wednesday evening, during a non-work-related dinner with a friend in a designated outdoor area, Mayor Wheeler was confronted by a group of people. The Mayor had been seated for about five minutes when a group of people began shouting obscenities at the Mayor from the outside of the tent.

'The Mayor attempted to ignore the group, but they eventually pushed their way past restaurant employees at the entrance to the tent and came inside. The Mayor asked them to leave. At that point, one member of the group started swatting at the Mayor and made physical contact with him. The Mayor was not injured. Restaurant staff persuaded the group to leave. Police arrived shortly after and the group dispersed.

'The Mayor is committed to supporting local businesses and wants others to do the same. Given the tenor of political discourse nationally and locally, it's not unusual for people to confront the Mayor and other elected officials in public. It's part of the job. The Mayor will continue to support local restaurants and businesses as often as he can. He urges others to do the same.'

Portland Mayor Ted Wheeler reacts after being exposed to tear gas fired by federal officers while attending a protest against police brutality and racial injustice last July

Wheeler lost the support of many of Portland's citizens after his city's police force used teargas and rubber bullets during the summer's protests over racial inequality in which protesters ran riot and the mayor essentially lost control of the liberal city.

He has recently become tougher in his stance towards demonstrations and has said he wants to see tougher penalties for people repeatedly caught engaging in violence and vandalism.

Wheeler has said he wants police officers to have more tools to investigate protest-related violence and promises tougher policing against demonstrators who break the law.

Protesters such as those heard in the video are also frustrated with him for his handling of homelessness in the city which has seen continued sweeps of tent encampments when many are financially struggling during the pandemic.

Nevertheless, Wheeler, won a second term as mayor in November despite criticism after months of protests and riots in the city.

Speaking after his win, Wheeler called for unity as he embarked on another four years as mayor.

'We're going to need to come together as never before to address short-term issues and the long-term changes and investments needed to rebuild our economy, rebuild confidence in law enforcement and restore hope for our future,' he said",Portland Mayor Ted Wheeler punched while dining outside as protesters frustrations boil over,1
https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/sep/14/republican-trump-don-bolduc-new-hampshire-senate-primary,1,"A far-right Republican who backs Donald Trump’s election fraud lie and has vowed to decertify results in 2024 will be the GOP candidate for US Senate in New Hampshire.

Don Bolduc, a retired special forces general who has said he suffered from PTSD and a traumatic brain injury, edged out Chuck Morse, the state senate president, to face the incumbent Democrat, Maggie Hassan, in November.

Most if not all forecasters called the race for Bolduc before Morse conceded.

The primary was the last in a series that have seen Republicans select candidates aligned with Trump, causing some to fear damage to their chances of winning the Senate in November.

Bolduc, 61, has echoed Trump’s lie about election fraud in his defeat by Joe Biden. He has also questioned whether the FBI should be abolished following its search of Trump’s Florida estate, which turned up a cache of classified documents.

Though Bolduc has courted Trump, he has not won an endorsement. Trump did call Bolduc a “strong guy”.

Last October, Bolduc spoke to the New Yorker. He said he thought his “values and principles as an American, and the constitution, which I served for 33-plus years in the military, was safe with President Trump”, and that Trump’s appeal stemmed from the (notoriously reading-averse) former president’s reading and understanding of the constitution.

He also said “there was a tremendous amount of fraud” in 2020, adding: “I very much believe it and I think it exists, and I think it happens and it’s been happening for a long time in this country. When you try to steal the presidency, a lot of people are going to go, ‘OK, wait a minute. What the hell’s going on here?’”

On 6 January 2021, nine senators were among 147 Republicans who voted to object to results in key states, even after the Capitol was stormed by a pro-Trump mob, a riot now linked to nine deaths, including suicides among law enforcement.

Asked if he would “walk the walk” on certification in the Senate in 2024, Bolduc told the New Yorker: “Oh, absolutely … everybody I talk to believes that in me.”

Bolduc also said January 6 represented “a complete failure of the political system”, blaming “the speaker of the House, the Senate majority leader, the minority leader” and the vice-president, Mike Pence, who refused to reject electoral votes.

“They failed us,” Bolduc said, “and so, therefore, now they’re trying to politicize it, turn it into something that it’s not.”

He said Trump supporters should not have used violence and destroyed property, but “believed that their rights were violated. They believed that they lost their voice.”

Morse was endorsed by the popular Republican governor of New Hampshire, Chris Sununu, whose decision not to take on Hassan himself disappointed many Republicans.

Sununu called Bolduc a “conspiracy theorist”. Bolduc called Sununu a “Chinese communist sympathiser”. But the governor promised to “endorse whoever the nominee is, and support him, of course I will, no question”.

In a newsletter on Wednesday, J Miles Coleman of the University of Virginia Center for Politics said Sununu’s endorsement of Morse had almost been enough to defeat Bolduc. But he also pointed to Democratic efforts to boost the Trumpist Republican, mirroring controversial tactics in other states.

Coleman wrote: “Some Republicans complained that the Democratic-aligned Senate Majority PAC intervened against Morse – given the margin, this may have been the decisive factor, although Morse also got some help from Republican outside groups.”

One national Republican group spent at least $4.6m in support of Morse.

The UVA center rates the New Hampshire Senate contest as “leans Democratic”.

Linda Fowler, a political science professor at Dartmouth, told Reuters Morse would have stood a better chance of beating Hassan because he would have appealed to independents, the majority in New Hampshire.

“If Bolduc gets the nomination, the independents will go to Hassan,” Fowler said, speaking before the result was known. “If he doesn’t get the nomination, the independents will have a serious choice.”

Neil Levesque, director of the New Hampshire Institute of Politics, told the Associated Press Bolduc was the kind of candidate who would have struggled before Trump’s rise. Bolduc has never held elected office and had just $75,000 in cash on hand last week. But he was able to position himself as an ally of Trump.

“If it mirrors the former president, it’s been effective,” Levesque said.",Republican backer of Trump’s big lie wins New Hampshire Senate primary,1

The fest, which makes its comeback to Indio, California April 15-17 and April 22-24, 2022 after missing 2020 and 2021, will not require concertgoers to have the shot.

The festival's official Instagram page made the announcement, saying that the decision was based on recent COVID statistics.

'After seeing first-hand the low transmission data and successful implementation of safety protocols at our other festivals this past month, we feel confident we can update our health policy,' they said in a statement.

This goes back on an announcement made by festival owner AEG in August that there'd need to be vaccinations for everyone who bought a ticket.

The former policy -- which is still listed on the Coachella website -- requires 'full vaccination' for all fans and staff, which they define as '14 days or more following the final dose of a US FDA approved or WHO recognized vaccine against COVID-19.'

The new rules are fairly straightforward: you can either show proof of vaccination or show proof of a negative COVID test taken within 72 hours of the date you're attending.

The move is in line with what the state of California deems 'mega events.' These are indoor events that have an attendance of 1,000 people and outdoor events over 10,000 people.

Those events all have the same requirements: a record of full vaccination or a negative COVID-19 test within 72 hours of your attendance.

AEG had originally announced a vaccine mandate for Coachella ticketholders back in August

AEG initially defended their August mandate by saying they thought it was in the best interest of everyone and they'd be on the 'right side of history.'

Several other recent festivals, including Chicago's Lollapalooza, Pitchfork Festival and Riot Fest, have used the same policies, mandating either vaccination proof or a recent negative COVID-19 test.

The 2019 Coachella, the most recent edition of the festival, welcomed 99,000 people per day.

All events ask that people follow the state health department's guidance for masks, which requires face coverings at almost all events for unvaccinated individuals.

The accusation was included in a memo circulated by House Oversight Committee Democratic staff designed that provides talking points for members. It calls out Republicans for releasing the transcripts of their interview with an FBI agent who raised issues with the investigation into Hunter Biden on the same day former President Trump was set to be indicted in Georgia.

The document offers the same claim that Republicans make in reverse: GOP committee members say that every time damaging news about Hunter Biden is dropped, Trump gets indicted.

Top Oversight Democrat Jamie Raskin had hammered Chairman James Comer for taking four weeks to release the transcript of an interview with a former FBI Supervisory Special Agent (SSA) that they said undercut the GOP's narrative.

House Oversight Democratic staff circulated a new memo Wednesday that points to suspect timing of the release of information about the Republican-led investigation of Hunter Biden

The memo specifically calls out Republicans for releasing the transcripts of their interview with an FBI agent on the same day former President Trump was set to be indicted in Georgia

Now, they accuse Comer of holding the transcript and not dropping it until Monday - the day Trump was indicted for the fourth time - this time in the Georgia election case. They also called out the chairman for giving the transcript to Fox News before releasing it publicly.

'The SSA’s statements during this interview clearly debunked Republicans’ claims of political interference in DOJ’s investigation and prosecution of Hunter Biden,' the letter, from Democratic staffers to Democratic members, read.

'Despite multiple calls by Ranking Member Raskin for Chairman Comer to publicly release the transcript and allow the American people to draw their own conclusions based on all of the facts, Chairman Comer waited four weeks to release the transcript and did so only after first providing it to Fox News.'

'Monday’s release of the SSA’s transcript is the most recent episode in congressional Republicans’ campaign to weaponize Congress and this Committee to do the political bidding of former President Trump.'

Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis indicted the former president over charges related to his attempts to overturn the election results in Georgia in 2020.

The Democrats also note that Comer released the transcripts of Hunter business partner Devon Archer's testimony on the same day Trump was arraigned on federal charges related to the January 6 Capitol riot.

The Democratic memo said both transcripts prove Republicans' probe of the Biden family business deals to be a 'complete and utter failure' and accuse them of trying to 'cherry-pick, distort, and mischaracterize facts.'

'Democrats’ latest propaganda is another example of them acting as Biden family defense lawyers,' a House Oversight GOP spokesperson said in response. 'The Oversight Committee’s investigation has produced concrete evidence through bank records and witness testimony that reveals Joe Biden’s involvement in his family’s corrupt influence peddling schemes.'

The memo admits Hunter Biden 'appears to have engaged in conduct that is common in lobbying and government relations in Washington—trading on family names and Washington connections, and, in the case of Hunter Biden the “illusion of access” to his father.'

But, they say the investigation has 'repeatedly found that President Biden never took any official action to benefit Hunter Biden, his clients, or his business partners.'

'This radical misuse of congressional resources by Republican Members of Congress to boost Mr. Trump’s election prospects is no secret strategy.'

Monday's newly released transcripts confirm IRS whistleblower testimony that the FBI attempted to interview Hunter Biden as part of their investigation into his tax and gun crimes but never got to do so.

Years into the Hunter Biden investigation, which began in 2018, the FBI decided to interview their target. The interview was to occur on December 8, 2020 - weeks after the presidential election. The FBI agent said he understood that Secret Service needed to be notified for safety reasons but said he intended to notify them at 8 a.m. the morning of the interview of their 'intent' to speak with Hunter.

But the evening before, the FBI agent learned both Secret Service and the Biden transition team had already been notified. 'This essentially tipped off a group of people very close to President Biden and Hunter Biden and gave this group an opportunity to obstruct the approach of the witness.'

'I felt it was people that did not need to know about our intent,' he said. 'I believe that the Secret Service had to be notified for our safety, for lack of confusion, for deconfliction, which we would do in so many other cases, but I didn't understand why the initial notification.'

The agent was then told to give his contact information to Secret Service and not to approach the house but to wait outside for a call saying Hunter was ready for the interview. The agent said that he had never recalled being told to wait for a target to call and say they were ready for an interview.

The call never came and the agent had other interviews to conduct, so he left.

As far as the Biden transition team being clued in, 'I don't know why that would have happened,' the agent said.

Democrats, led by ranking member Jamie Raskin, had hammered Chairman James Comer for taking four weeks to release the transcript of an interview with a former FBI Supervisory Special Agent (SSA) that they said undercut the GOP narrative

'Despite multiple calls by Ranking Member Raskin [above]for Chairman Comer to publicly release the transcript and allow the American people to draw their own conclusions based on all of the facts, Chairman Comer waited four weeks to release the transcript and did so only after first providing it to Fox News,' memo says

The unusual interview attempt occurred under the Trump administration, while U.S. attorney David Weiss in Delaware was overseeing the Hunter Biden case. Weiss has since been appointed special counsel over the case, giving him greater independence from the main Department of Justice.

When asked if he had 'ever known U.S. Attorney David Weiss to make prosecutorial decisions based upon political influence,' the agent said 'no.'

The Hunter Biden case remains ongoing after a plea deal blew up when the judge notified Hunter that pleading guilty to tax and gun crimes would not shield him from future charges, specifically mentioning failing to register as a foreign agent.

Meanwhile, the Archer testimony, which dropped on the day of Trump's arraignment, revealed that Joe Biden had spoken with Hunter's Business associates around 20 times over the course of 10 years. Archer did not claim to have ever heard Biden directly discuss business, but said having a then-vice president father on the phone sold the idea of access to foreign executives.",Democrats accuse House GOP of 'weaponizing' resources to go after Hunter and Biden family corruption probes and point finger at suspect timing to 'distract' from Trump's legal woes,1

Channel Nine and Seven choppers were told they were not allowed to fly above Melbourne's CBD on Wednesday because authorities believed it was giving away strategic information to the figures organising the protests.

Anchors on Channel Nine Melbourne revealed they had been asked by Victoria Police to stop their helicopters filming the demonstrations because it reveals where police are set up around the city - potentially making them a target.

'One of the things our viewer might have noticed is we're getting ground shots as opposed to aerials. That's a feature of this ordeal over the past few days is that we have been getting those aerials,' anchor Tony Jones said on Wednesday evening.

'I was going to say a good explanation as to why we're not getting aerial shots now. In short we're told by Victoria Police, the Civil Aviation Authority put a no fly order another the moment that is covering Melbourne's CBD.

'They are arguing that our news chopper footage was helping the protesters to see where police were. So they were able to adjust their tactics as such.'

Police reversed their decision on Wednesday night, but networks will have to delay the footage by an hour before broadcasting to viewers.

Police with riot shields monitored the rally, where demonstrators were told over loudspeaker 'leave now or more force may be used'

Victoria Police confirmed on Wednesday night they would allow media helicopters to provide aerial shots, but they weren't allowed to broadcast live.

'I supported the request because what was happening was that the live news footage from the helicopters was being used by the protesters to identify where we were and what our tactics were at different locations,' Police Deputy Commissioner Ross Guenther said.

'Having said that, we reviewed that later this afternoon, recognising that it is important for the media to get their pictures in these situations.'

The riots entered a third day of violence on Wednesday as protesters set up outside Melbourne's Shrine of Remembrance, with RSL groups claiming they desecrated and defiled the state's most honoured war memorial.

Police arrested more than 200 people at Wednesday's protest. Tap handles, golf balls and batteries were thrown at police, according to Deputy Commissioner Ross Guenther.

Two police sustained head injuries after being pelted with bottles.

Pictures and footage of the riots has decorated Australian TV screens and media outlets, but aerial shots disappeared on Wednesday after a request from authorities.

'That's why our news chopper cannot be in the air at the moment. So essentially it's been banned from flying within a 5 kilometre radius of the CBD,' the Nine News Melbourne anchors revealed.

Protesters waved flags as they marched on the war memorial which was set up to honour fallen soldiers in First World War

They then complained the media had a responsibility to show the riots to people at home, adding that the footage could be valuable to police.

'We would argue from a news organisation point of view it's the public's right to know. We have the right to get that information out there and to be able to cover these protests and show them for what they are,' Mr Jones said.

'I would have thought today was a perfect example where that Intel as in the aerial shots might have helped police.

'As we know from our reporters on the ground throughout the morning and certainly early afternoon, the protesters were breaking up into various smaller groups going here there and everywhere around our gridded city and the aerial shots would have helped there.

Protesters waved flags as they marched on the war memorial which was set up to honour fallen soldiers in First World War

Mr Jones then went on to criticise the police's tactics over the past few days, saying he doesn't understand their 'rationale'.

'I don't quite understand a lot of things police are doing at the moment. If you have the chief commissioner coming out last night, with quite strong narratives and he backs that up again today, but we're not actually seeing any evidence of that,' he said.

'I'm not entirely sure when we'll actually see police seize control.

'It's interesting to note that is a tactic that Victoria Police are using. They're worried the protesters are watching those aerial shots.

https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/may/31/tulsa-massacre-descendants-callout-stories,1,"Earlier this month, the three known survivors of the 1921 Tulsa massacre testified in Congress about the world they lost when a white mob burned their thriving community to the ground. “The neighborhood I fell asleep in that night was rich – not just in terms of wealth, but in culture, community and heritage,” said Viola Fletcher, who was visiting the US capital for the first time in her 107 years. “Within a few hours, all of that was gone.”

After being willfully suppressed from the national memory for close to a century, in many ways the history of the massacre is now more visible than ever – in media, popular culture and even the US Capitol. But this history, and the question of who has the right to tell it, remain contested. That is true even in Tulsa itself, where Black Tulsans say official centennial commemorations have obscured its lingering effects on their community and failed to meaningfully involve descendants of survivors and victims.

We wanted to hear directly from those descendants about how the massacre affected their families, in 1921 and to this day. A number of themes emerge from the responses we received. One is the culture of silence that long surrounded the massacre. Most of the readers who responded told us they hadn’t heard about it until well into their adult years. Another is a sense of pride over their links to such a historic locus of Black prosperity. And yet another is a deep loss, over the relatives killed and displaced, the community erased and the wealth eradicated – wealth that could have changed the course of entire generations.

‘I did not hear about the massacre until I was well into my adult years’

View image in fullscreen Barbara Barros

My grandparents, an aunt and an uncle were survivors of the massacre. My grandparents were land owners as well as business owners. I did not hear about the race massacre until I was well into my adult years, probably my 40s.

My grandmother, Daisy Scott, was a political cartoonist for the Tulsa Star. She drew cartoons that depicted the racial injustice of that time and the funny thing is her illustrations fit right in with today’s injustices still happening for Black people. My grandfather, Jack Scott, was a professional boxer and one of the men who went down to the courthouse to protect Dick Rowland. A very brave man!

This massacre affected our family in terms of generational wealth. My grandparents owned land on Greenwood Place that was taken by the city of Tulsa to build the University of Oklahoma. That land could have remained in our family’s name and we could have benefitted from it. Land never depreciates and it would have given our family members a running start. –Barbara Barros, 65, writer and retired educator

‘The JB Stradford empire was worth millions prior to 1917. But my great-grandfather wasn’t able to recreate what he lost’

View image in fullscreen Teague Stradford-Dow

I’m the great-granddaughter and great-great-granddaughter of JB Stradford and his father, Julius Caesar, who were born into servitude. He was not given a last name during his servitude and adopted the surname Stradford.

Julius instilled his education and ethic values on to his son. Consequently, JB Stradford put emphasis on education, acquiring a law degree from Indiana University, and became an advocate for himself and others.

In 1881, JB enrolled at Oberlin School, in Ohio, where he met his wife, Bertie Wiley. After commencement, they moved to Kentucky. He became a college principal and proprietor of a barbershop. After witnessing a lynching in Kentucky, Indiana was their next stop. JB opened another barbershop and became a bicycle retailer. After hearing of business opportunities and growing Black towns in Oklahoma, he decided to move there in 1905. Bertie died unexpectedly shortly before the move.

JB arrived in Tulsa on 9 March 1905, and eight months later, oil drillers hit a primary gusher not far from Tulsa. Tulsa became a boomtown and the Black labor force was plentiful and well in demand.

Five years after his arrival in Tulsa, he met and married his second wife, Augusta L, in 1910. His independent projects included the Stradford Hotel, his crown jewel, at 301 N Greenwood, along with considerable other rental property, land lots and an apartment building. It was estimated that the JB Stradford empire was well worth over $3m dollars prior to 1917.

Twenty-three years after JB resettled in Oklahoma, the Tulsa race riot changed the landscape of what was Black Wall Street, Tulsa and my great-grandfather’s many accomplishments.

For his part in trying to protect Dick Rowland , my great-grandfather was said to be the instigator of the riot and was arrested. With few resources, he was able to escape to his brother in Kansas. From there, he joined his son, a lawyer, in Chicago.

In Chicago, my great-grandfather wasn’t able to recreate what he lost in the Black Wall Street massacre; however, he owned a sweet retailer, barbershop and pool corridor before he died. He died in 1935 at the age of 74 and remained embittered due to the loss and horrors he witnessed and endured.

JB Stradford’s descendants went on to become judges, doctors, professionals, musicians, artists, designers (of which I’m one), entrepreneurs and activists. We acknowledge our African heritage and continue the legacy of self-improvement and personal growth through determination, passed down.

In 1996, 75 years after the Tulsa race massacre, JB Stradford was exonerated for all wrongdoings in the Tulsa race riot accusations, against JB Stradford. –Teague Stradford-Dow, 76, fashion designer and teacher

‘The loss is incalculable’

View image in fullscreen Jon Stuart Adams

Some of my not-too-distant relatives were both survivors and victims of the Tulsa race riots. My great-great uncle, Andrew Chesteen Jackson (Dr AC Jackson), was murdered by white teenage thugs. He was shot in the stomach and bled out, finally dying on 2 June 1921. His father, Captain TD Jackson, rode on horseback for five days so that he could bury his son in Guthrie. Capt Jackson did not want his son to suffer the final indignity that most other victims and families experienced; most deceased Black people were thrown into the Arkansas River. It was said that white citizens threatened Black funeral homes with death and destruction if they funeralized any Black victims.

My other relatives were survivors of the riots. HA Guess, a prominent Tulsa attorney and my great-grandfather, hid out in his chicken coop while his wife, Minnie Mae, hid under the family home with her daughters. (Their son grabbed his father’s gun and ran downtown to join the fight.) Their house was about to be torched until a white citizen threatened to prosecute these would-be marauders. Had things gone the other way, I wouldn’t be sharing this story with you.

The loss resulting from the riots is incalculable. Dr Jackson was on the cusp of greatness. Had he lived, he could have created some breakthrough treatments for infectious diseases. He saved my aunt Wilhelmenia from scarlet fever when she was just eight years old. There is no telling how many lives in Tulsa he could have saved, including of Tulsa’s white citizens. As for my family members who survived, they remained traumatized and heartbroken; my aunt could no longer bear to look at Dr Jackson’s picture in her home. The rest of my family’s survivors suffered mightily from trauma for the rest of their lives. Some 45 years later, Dr Jackson’s widow, Julia A Jackson, visited my family in Washington DC. She was still traumatized and broken-hearted about Dr Jackson’s death.

My family never really talked about the riots. It wasn’t until we were adults did I and my siblings learn of this horrific tragedy. Perhaps it was just too painful to talk about. Our children have just become aware of this tragedy and are eager to know more. Right now, my family is on a quest to leave no stone unturned in our research on the lives of Dr Jackson and other family members. We are particularly committed to building out a digital footprint of Dr Jackson’s life, trying to understand how he lived rather than how he died. To honor him, we placed a tombstone on his grave in Tulsa some years ago.

There is a through line from this disaster to many of today’s racial struggles, from the “birther” controversy to the many fatal struggles our young men have with law enforcement. None of us were left unscathed by Tulsa; none of us will be left unscathed from recent events either. –Jon Stuart Adams, 64, federal government employee

‘To see how the massacre affected our community, just look at north Tulsa’

I am 61 years old. I live in Tulsa, Oklahoma, in a home built by my grandfather, the late John Reggin Emerson Sr.

Mr Emerson was a prominent businessman who purchased and developed large tracts of land in the city of Tulsa during the 1920s. Born on 22 February 1885 in Tennessee, John was the second child of Jerry D and Sallie Emerson. The Emerson family left Tennessee and migrated to Arkansas and then later on into the Indian Territories, in present day Logan county, Oklahoma. It was there that the family set up shop with a mercantile business in 1888. The store and its building provided goods to area farmers and the growing city of nearby Guthrie.

Upon his father’s untimely murder in the line of duty as the Guthrie jailer, John felt his family would have greater opportunities within the newly developing town of Tulsa. John built, developed and became the proprietor of the Emerson Hotel on Greenwood Avenue.

As the massacre unfolded in the early morning hours of 31 May 1921, John and his daughter took shelter, hiding under the railroad tracks. When the time came that they felt safe enough, they found their way home to a ruined Emerson Hotel. It had been ransacked.

Following the 1921 Tulsa race massacre, John erected a second hotel on the corner of Lansing and Pine streets. This newer hotel provided storefronts at the street level and hotel rooms on the upper floor. He also started the Bluebird Cab Company in 1924.

John expanded his financial portfolio by constructing over 140 homes in the Tulsa area. He also owned a large working cattle farm. He had five children.

John Reggin Emerson Sr was honored posthumously by the North Tulsa Heritage Foundation in 2001. His contributions before and following the 1921 Tulsa race massacre were instrumental to its initial growth and the rebuilding following the destruction.

I just learned about the massacre within the last 15 years. It was omitted from the textbooks and forbidden to talk about for decades.

The Black wealth that existed before the 1921 race massacre is no longer in Tulsa. North Tulsa, where the majority of Blacks reside, has been a food desert for over a decade. The life expectancy is far less for Blacks than whites. There are no hospitals in the community. To see how the massacre has affected our community, you just need to look at north Tulsa. –Jacqueline Weary, 61, retired insurance consultant

‘Racial discrimination and gentrification have continued to help destroy Greenwood’

My great-aunt Janie Edwards was in the Dreamland Theater on a secret date when the massacre happened. She was able to escape with her date and ran to the nearby town of Claremore. It took her eight years before she mustered up the courage to go back to Tulsa.

As a child, my family always told stories about my aunt’s experience as a Creek Freedman and a victim of the Tulsa race massacre in 1921. One day while watching TV, I heard former state representative Don Ross talk about the history of Greenwood and the massacre. It was at that moment when I realized this was the story I heard as a child about my Aunt Janie. I knew then what I was meant to do.

The 1921 Tulsa race massacre has directly affected my family and community in more ways than one. It has had ripple effects spanning from the judicial system, loss of land, loss of homes, loss of businesses. In the 1920s, Black homeownership was at 30% and white homeownership was 35%. Today, Black homeownership is 32% and white homeownership is 57.9%. Racial discrimination in home appraisals and gentrification have continued to help destroy Greenwood and the Black community here in Tulsa. To address this history, we need reparations in the form of cash and land. Simultaneously, we need policies to end racial discrimination in home appraisals and lending and to support Black businesses, health and education.

After the centennial of the 1921 Tulsa race massacre, the cameras will go away, journalists will go to the next popular story, but I will still be here. I will never stop fighting for my community or my ancestors. This has never been about photo ops or fame for me. It’s all about my community and ancestors. –Kristi Williams, community activist and chair of the Greater Tulsa African American Affairs Commission

‘Our family history is the one thing that was not stolen from us’

View image in fullscreen Lauren Usher

Right around the time I enrolled in undergrad, my grandmother gave me a manuscript written by her great-grandfather, JB Stradford. It was a memoir that began with his father buying his own freedom from enslavement in Versailles, Kentucky, and continued through JB’s life as a successful business owner and hotelier in Tulsa, Oklahoma.

It was by reading this memoir that I understood a part of family history that I had only heard about in passing – the Tulsa race massacre that had destroyed our family business and criminalized our patriarch, JB Stradford. I know how lucky I am to have this family history passed down from generation to generation. This is the one thing that was not stolen from us.

Educated at Oberlin College and Indianapolis Law School, JB had a hotel business in Tulsa that would have been worth over $2m in today’s money. His hotel, the 54-room Stradford Hotel on historic Greenwood Avenue, was sacked and burned to the ground during the Tulsa massacre of 1921, along with 44 square blocks of Black-owned property, causing him to flee to Kansas and later to Chicago in order to save his life. He was falsely indicted for inciting the riot by an inflamed white grand jury for daring to stand up, with his community, to stop a mob from breaking into a jail and lynching a Black man, which is what began the massacre.

The history of theft from my Black community continues to this day in many overt and insidious forms, including for example through the historic redlining of Black communities and under-valuing of Black homes during appraisals. Like compound interest, this theft compounds exponentially over time.

Extra-judicial killings continue, both by police and civilian whites, as in the case of Ahmaud Arbery, because both groups are still indoctrinated on some level to believe that Black people are more property than brothers to them. –Lauren Usher, 32

‘If this history was shared with us when we were young it may have changed the course of many of the descendants’ lives’

My grandparents were Jack and Daisy Scott. Jack in his younger years was a professional boxer and worked as a janitor. My grandmother Daisy was an artist and worked as a political cartoonist for the Tulsa Star. Her work can be found on the front page of the issues prior to the massacre. They were present during the massacre and were able to escape with their two-year-old daughter, my aunt Juanita Parry, and their unborn son, my uncle Julius Warren Scott. Both my aunt and uncle are among the survivors whose pictures hang on the walls of the Greenwood Cultural Center.

My grandfather was one of the men who bravely went to the courthouse to defend Dick Rowland. As a result of the massacre my grandparents lost their home, property, business, and, most importantly, almost their lives. They went on to raise 11 children in Tulsa, though things were never the same. My grandparents, though they survived, were not able to pursue their dreams. They and the other victims were denied insurance claims, as is well documented. Though I did not have the honor of meeting them, I’m sure they relived the trauma of the devastation they endured each and every day.

I first heard of the Tulsa massacre as a young adult. It was then called the race riot. As a descendant, it is my duty and honor to keep sharing their (our) story so that the generations to follow understand what strength and perseverance is and help “re-right” history so it does not repeat itself.

The generational wealth that was lost by the taking of land and other properties directly affected my grandparents, their children and their descendants. I’m sure many of the people that suffered this massacre most certainly experienced PTSD and exhibited symptoms that were seen and passed down as generational trauma. Breaking this cycle is difficult, especially after years of not communicating about this tragedy. There is a great health disparity that still exists not only in Tulsa, but across the nation. It has been discussed for many years but is now being truly recognized.

I feel if this history was shared with us when we were young it may have changed the course of many of the descendants’ lives and it would have helped us to understand and appreciate what our ancestors were living with every day.

My family is rich with the talents of my Grandma Daisy, possessing wonderful musical and artistic abilities, and exhibit the entrepreneurship qualities of my Grandfather Jack. I’m certain they would be proud to learn of the many college graduates that make up their descendants. –Maureen Scott, 65, nurse practitioner

Carlson played a clip of Milley's response to Republican lawmakers' claims that the US military is becoming too 'woke' during Wednesday's House of Representatives Armed Services Committee meeting.

'I want to understand white rage, and I'm white and I want to understand it,' Milley said.

'What is it that caused thousands of people to assault this building and try to overturn the Constitution of the United States of America? What caused that? I want to find that out. I want to maintain an open mind here.'

Carlson called Milley's statement 'a racial attack… an attack against people on the basis of their skin color.'

'White rage is not a medical condition, it's not even a legitimate academic theory. It doesn't exist,' Carlson said. 'We shouldn't have a chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff attacking Americans on their skin color. It's disgusting.'

Carlson was joined by Sean Parnell, an Infantry Captain and Purple Heart recipient who's running for a Pennsylvania Senate seat.

He said implementing critical race theory will 'destroy the United States military from the inside out without firing a shot.'

'Out secret weapon wasn't the sexy guns and equipment that we had; it was the love and brotherhood that we had for one another that allowed us to defeat the enemy. Critical race theory undermines all of that.'

Parnell said Milley should could resign.

Friday's monologue against Milley comes 24 hours after Carlson called him 'stupid' and 'a pig' and said he doesn't deserve to be the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, a position he's held since he was appointed by former President Donald Trump.

'He got the job because he is obsequious,' Carlson said of Milley. 'He knows who to suck up to and he's more than happy to do it. Feed him a script and he will read it.

'Hard to believe that man wears a uniform. He's that unimpressive. What is white rage? It's one of those diseases that only affects people with certain melanin levels.'

'It is a race-specific illness. That is what Mark Milley learned from reading about it, that's why he's making the soldiers read about it too. They need to know!' Carlson added.

A West Point graduate, Milley is a decorated Army Ranger and Green Beret with extensive combat experience including multiple deployments to Afghanistan as well as combat tours in Iraq, Somalia, Panama and Colombia.

Carlson lashed out at Mark Milley for the second day in a row after the general defended critical race theory during a Congressional hearing

'I do think it's important for those of us in uniform to be open-minded and be widely read,' Milley said in his testimony. 'I want to understand 'white rage' and I am white'

During Thursday's show, Carlson went on to play an additional clip of Milley's testimony, in which he said: 'I've read Karl Marx, I've read Lenin, that doesn't make me me a communist. What is wrong with having some situational understanding of the country which we are here to defend? It's offensive that we are accusing our military, our general officers, our noncommissioned officers who are coming up, of being 'Woke.''

'He's not just a pig, he's stupid,' said Carlson, laughing. 'He reads communists to understand communism, but it's interesting he doesn't read white supremacists to understand white supremacy. Why not go to the source?'

'Because Mark Milley would be fired instantly if he read those books. And getting fired is the one thing he doesn't want. So he reads about white rage as if it's totally real. It's a medical condition. And by the way, since it's a medical condition, at what age can you catch white rage?' added Carlson.

'Thanks Mark Milley, we appreciate your contribution to our generation's scientific racism. By the way, have you read anything recently about winning wars? Apparently not,' he continued.

Carlson's remarks drew strong backlash from Democrats and some other pundits, with CNN host Brianna Keilar firing back: 'He pretends white rage doesn't exist. He is white rage!'

'Dear @TuckerCarlson: Why do you hate America so much?' tweeted Rep. Ted Lieu, the Democrat from California and Air Force veteran.

'General Mark Milley lead [sic] soldiers in Afghanistan and Iraq, including combat duties. He's served in the 82nd Airborne & 5th Special Forces Group,' Lieu added, before mocking Carlson for his failed attempt to join the CIA after graduating college.

'Tucker Carlson, who never had the courage to serve in the military, calls Chairman of the Joint Chiefs Gen. Milley a 'pig' and 'stupid,'' tweeted Travis Akers, a Naval intelligence officer and progressive pundit.

'I believe an overwhelming majority of my brothers and sisters in arms would agree if I said @TuckerCarlson was a cowardly piece of s**t,' he added.

Others speculated that Carlson's line of attack was an attempt to deflect from reports that emerged on Thursday that Milley flatly rejected an order from former President Donald Trump to use the military against riots last summer.

'Best way to understand Tucker Carlson's abuse of General Mark Milley tonight is as confirmation of the accuracy of the stories Gen Milley told about rebuffing ex President Trump's order for a massacre in Portland, Oregon,' tweeted David Frum, a neoconservative pundit and former George W. Bush speechwriter.

On the right, other conservatives joined Carlson in criticizing Milley's testimony.

'Hard to believe that man wears a uniform. He's that unimpressive. What is white rage? It's one of those diseases that only affects people with certain melanin levels,' said Carlson

'Gen. Milley is a pathetic virtue signaler who bent a knee to identity politicking Marxists,' tweeted right-wing pundit John Cardillo. 'He should be ashamed of himself for CRT and drag shows on bases. Tucker was spot on calling him a coward.'

'I had such bad embarrassment for Mark Milley who obviously had no idea what he was talking about,' tweeted Rebeccah Heinrichs, a senior fellow at the Hudson Institute, a conservative think tank.

'Truly painful. But it is endlessly stupid watching smart ppl praise him. He defended garbage lit[erature] and panels being fed to our mil[itary] schools at a time when we REALLY can't afford it,' added Heinrichs.

'In a sensible world Mark Milley would be fired for his racist remarks yesterday in front of congress where he asserted a rage condition exists that only affects white people,' tweeted Robby Starbuck, the music video director and outspoken conservative.

'That sort of discriminatory detachment from reality makes him unfit to hold power over the US military,' he added.

Chairman of the Joint Chiefs Mark Milley hit back against growing criticism over teaching critical race theory in the military on Wednesday

In Milley's testimony on Wednesday, he did not endorse critical race theory outright, but strongly condemned those who say it shouldn't be taught.

Critical race theory is a philosophy that posits that America and its system of laws and government are inherently white supremacist.

Critics say that it is divisive and discriminatory, dividing people into categories of 'privileged' and 'oppressed' based on their skin tone.

'What is wrong with understanding - having some situational understanding - about the country for which we are here to defend?' Milley asked before the House of Representatives Armed Services Committee.

'And I personally find it offensive that we are accusing the United States military, our general officers, our commissioned and noncommissioned officers, of being, 'woke' or something else, because we're studying some theories that are out there.'",Tucker Carlson doubles down on criticisms of Gen.

Republicans who voted to block Joe Biden’s confirmation as president have been deserted by some of the biggest corporations in the US, as some leading rightwing politicians begin to face potential consequences for the Capitol riot on Wednesday.

A slew of companies, including Citigroup, one of the biggest banks in the US, and the Marriott hotel chain, said they would halt donations to Republicans who voted against certifying the results of the presidential election.

The desertion comes after riots at the Capitol on Wednesday. Despite mobs storming the building, egged on by Donald Trump’s spurious claims of voter fraud, 147 Republicans voted to reject Joe Biden’s electoral victory later that same day. Senators Ted Cruz and Josh Hawley were among those to dissent, along with scores of House representatives.

“At the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association, we continuously evaluate our political contributions to ensure that those we support share our values and goals,” said Kim Keck, president and CEO of BlueCross BlueShield, a sprawling healthcare company.

“In light of this week’s violent, shocking assault on the United States Capitol, and the votes of some members of Congress to subvert the results of November’s election by challenging Electoral College results, BCBSA will suspend contributions to those lawmakers who voted to undermine our democracy.”

The companies’ donations amount to hundreds of thousands of dollars, and could have a lasting impact on future elections. The political committee arm of Blue Cross Blue Shield, Bluepac, alone donated $246,750 to Republican officials during the 2020 elections, according to Opensecrets.org.

In a memo to staff, Citigroup said it had donated $1,000 to Hawley’s campaign – citing a “significant employee presence” in the senator’s state of Missouri, the Wall Street Journal reported. Hawley, with Cruz, has become one of the highest-profile objectors to the certification of Biden’s win, and has perpetuated hoaxes about voter fraud. There are growing calls for both men to resign.

‘We want you to be assured that we will not support candidates who do not respect the rule of law,’ wrote Candi Wolff, head of Citi’s global government affairs.

‘We intend to pause our contributions during the quarter as the country goes through the presidential transition and hopefully emerges from these events stronger and more united.’

The Marriott hotel chain said it would also suspend donations from its political action campaign to lawmakers who opposed the presidential election results. Marriott gave $1,000 to Hawley’s election campaign and $1,000 to his leadership committee, Mother Jones reported.

“We have taken the destructive events at the Capitol to undermine a legitimate and fair election into consideration and will be pausing political giving from our Political Action Committee to those who voted against certification of the election,” the company said in a statement.

Boston Scientific, a medical device company, and the parent company of Commerce Bank also said they would not donate to the Republicans who attempted to overturn the election result. “At this time, we have suspended all support for officials who have impeded the peaceful transfer of power,” a spokesperson for Commerce Bancshares told the Popular Information newsletter.

CVS, Exxon Mobil, FedEx and Target all said they were reviewing future political donations, according to multiple reports, as were Bank of America, Ford and AT&T.

In a further blow to Donald Trump and the Republican party, the digital payment company Stripe said it would stop processing payments for Trump’s campaign website, company sources told the Wall Street Journal.

Trump made the pitch to Pence in a January 4th Oval Office meeting that included the lawyer, James Eastman, who was then the dean of the Chapman University Law School, and was among a group of figures pushing Trump's electoral fraud claims up until his final days in office.

'You really need to listen to John. He's a respected constitutional scholar. Hear him out,' Trump told Pence, according to Peril, by Woodward and journalist Robert Costa.

The authors write about a six-point memo that Eastman, who later spoke at the 'Stop the Steal Rally' near the White House Jan. 6th, drafted.

Former Chapman University law professor John Eastman, next to U.S. President Donald Trump's personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani, drafted a six-point memo spelling out his beliefs about how Vice President Mike Pence could refuse to accept votes from seven states where Trump allies were claiming fraud

The memo sketches out steps Eastman proposed Pence could take while presiding over counting the Electoral College votes from the states – a role that Pence himself and numerous constitutional scholars concluded was largely ceremonial.

The Eastman memo, published by CNN, carves out a pivotal role for Pence. When counting votes from states where Trump was claiming fraud, Pence would cite 'ongoing disputes in the 7 States' to claim that there are in fact 'no electors that can be deemed validly appointed in those States.'

Doing so would put Trump ahead, by 232 to 222 electoral votes. 'Pence then gavels President Trump as re-elected,' Eastman rights.

In fact Biden amassed 306 electoral votes, according to the results certified by states.

'You really need to listen to John,' Woodward's book quotes former President Donald Trump as telling Vice President Mike Pence

The move would provoke 'howls' from Democrats, Eastman predicted.

'So Pence says fine' and sends the matter to the House, where under the 12th Amendment each state delegation would get a single vote in deciding a disputed election.

'Republicans currently control 26 of the state delegations, the bare majority needed to win that vote. President Trump is re-elected there as well,' Eastman writes.

'The fact is that the Constitution assigns this power to the Vice President as the ultimate arbiter. We should take all of our actions with that in mind,' according to Eastman's interpretation.

Eastman's memo urges Pence to cite 'ongoing disputes in the 7 States' and refuse to accept their electors

Eastman said Pence should act 'without asking for permission' from Congress or the Supreme Court when refusing to accept votes certified by states

Eastman's effort to pitch the memo to Lee, a Utah conservative Republican, were ineffective.

'You might as well make your case to Queen Elizabeth II. Congress can't do this. You're wasting your time,' Lee told him, according to the book.

The pitch came despite no state sending an alternate set of electors for Congress to consider, something that has happened in historical instances.

'Lee's head was spinning,' according to Woodward and Costa. 'No such procedure existed in the Constitution, any law or past practice. Eastman had apparently drawn it out of thin air.'

Lee himself voted to certify votes from Arizona and Pennsylvania where Trump and his allies were claiming fraud. 'Our job is a very simple one. Our job is to convene to open the ballots and to count them. That's it,' he said on the Senate floor.

Eastman retired from his law position a week after the Capitol riot.

Pence refused the course of action Trump urged him to consider, and Trump tweeted angrily at him on Jan. 6th.

'Mike Pence didn't have the courage to do what should have been done to protect our Country and our Constitution, giving States a chance to certify a corrected set of facts, not the fraudulent or inaccurate ones which they were asked to previously certify. USA demands the truth!' Trump wrote.",Trump tried to get Pence to throw out election result with six-point plan dreamed up John Eastman,1

All of them are seen in dark colored hoodies and sweatpants. The police have not released any other identifiable information and are now desperately seeking the public's help in identifying the robbers.

This robbery is part of an increasing number of thefts in retail businesses across the state.

Two weeks ago, cops were hunting ten more Philadelphia looters who broke into a Dunkin' Donuts to steal a safe and merchandise as 72 people were charged over a huge raid on the city's Apple Store the same night.

The same group of thieves also ransacked Footlocker and Lululemon. Videos shared on social media show officers attempting to grab thieves, some of whom wear Halloween masks as they riot through a Lululemon store.

One officer managed to hit one of the looters with a punch after tackling them to the ground.

The incident happened on Walnut Street in the heart of the city center and also involved a nearby Foot Locker and Apple store

Businesses suffered two nights of looting stretching from the city center to its northeastern and western districts and cops later revealed Dunkin' also fell victim to thieves.

Dozens participated in a smash-and-grab raid on the Apple store in Walnut Street on September 26 while pharmacies, liquor stores, pawnbrokers and even a hairdresser were among at least 80 businesses that fell victim.

About twenty people have been arrested after widespread looting broke out in Philadelphia last night, with one woman who livestreamed the chaos

Philadelphia Police Department are seeking to identify the ten people caught on the Dunkin' security camera that night - several of whom did not bother to cover their faces.

Assistant DA Clint Orem revealed that five minors and 67 adults have been charged in connection with the other raids on Monday morning.

Among them is Dayjia ‘Meatball’ Blackwell who became the poster girl of the crimewave after livestreaming the city center raids on her Instagram page, complete with a triumphant commentary.

'Tell the police if they lock me up tonight, it's going to be lit, it's going to be a movie! Everybody's gotta eat!' Meatball, 21, told her 181,000 followers.

But she wept as officials booked her, and her grandmother spoke of her shame after helping to raise her.

What goes through my mind, as a grandmother, is I'm very ashamed,’ Vashti Fields told FOX 29.

A police officer said at the time that over 100 juveniles had looted the Lululemon store.

Earlier that day, protests had started around the city over the dismissal of charges against police officer Mark Dial who was involved in the fatal shooting of Eddie Irizarry.

Police bodycam footage showed Dial firing his weapon at close range through the rolled-up driver’s side window of Irizarry’s sedan during a vehicle stop in August. Dial shot Irizarry about seven seconds after getting out of a police SUV.

He had been charged with murder, voluntary manslaughter, official oppression and aggravated assault but later, a judge dropped them all.

According to the police department, Philly saw an increase of 20.75 percent in gun-based robberies and an 11.21 percent increase in thefts with other weapons between 2021-2022.

Bebe King, six, Elsie Dot Stancombe, seven, and Alice Dasilva Aguiar, nine, were named as the tragic victims of the incident the following day.

Leanne, who was one of the organisers of the Taylor Swift-themed holiday class, underwent life-saving surgery in the hours after the rampage.

The teacher was quickly hailed as a hero after reports emerged that she used her body as a shield to protect children.

She told LBC: 'It has just made us feel very unsafe.

'My purpose was creating wellbeing events for children and families, and for that to happen where I was, and for the words I spoke and the children spoke, for that to be trampled over has really dampened all of our spirits.

Axel Rudakubana has been charged with three counts of murder and 10 counts of attempted murder

The killings sparked large scale riots, fuelled by misinformation on social media, in towns and cities across the UK.

The following day after the attack a far-Right riot saw more than 50 officers injured in the disorder, which later spread to other regions.

A wave of carnage then unfolded in areas such as Manchester, Bolton, Hull, Liverpool, Bristol, Blackpool and Belfast.

Migrant hotels were also targeted in Tamworth and Rotherham - with bins and generators set alight and officers left injured.

Merseyside Police made a total of 151 arrests, with 107 people charged and 82 sentenced to a total of 172 years and seven months in prison so far. Nationally, there have been roughly 2,000 arrests.

Despite this, Ms Lucas told the news organisation: 'There's been a lot of love come from Southport, a lot of love come from all over the world. The impact has been tragic but there has been some goodness at times.'

Earlier this month, it was revealed that prosecutors delayed charging Southport murder suspect Axel Rudakubana for up to fortnight due to fears it may spark riots.

The 18-year-old, who is accused of murdering three girls during a knife rampage in July, was due to be charged with making the highly toxic poison ricin and possessing a study of an al-Qaeda training manual on October 18.

Police chiefs feared it would cause further unrest and accordingly made preparations to cancel police leave across the country over the weekend of October 19.

At the time chief constables were also worried about the prospect of firearms officers downing their weapons in protest across the UK if Scotland Yard marksman Martyn Blake were to be found guilty of murdering gangster Chris Kaba in an unrelated police vehicle stop in September 2022.

Blake was acquitted at the Old Bailey just days later which meant fears of a national firearms officer walkout did not materialise.

The postponement in announcing charges, which came more than two months after the teenager was charged with three counts of murder and ten attempted murders sparked immediate claims of a cover up.

Axel Rudakubana, 18, has been charged with three counts of murder and 10 counts of attempted murder.

https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-9828389/House-KILLS-Kevin-McCarthys-bid-Republican-picks-Capitol-Riot-committee.html,1,"The House of Representatives voted Monday night to kill a resolution from Republican leader Kevin McCarthy to get his picks on Nancy Pelosi's Capitol Riot Select Committee.

Republicans Liz Cheney and Adam Kinzinger, who many inside the GOP want to see punished for choosing to take their seats on the panel, voted against the measure with the vote finishing 218-197.

McCarthy's resolution was the last bid to compel Pelosi to accept the five Republican members and allow them to be part of the investigation he has called a 'sham'.

He withdrew all his nominations when Pelosi refused to seat Reps Jim Banks and Jim Jordan last week.

The vote came just hours before the first hearing was set to begin on Tuesday into the investigation into January 6.

Cheney said on Monday that McCarthy was 'childish' for labeling her and Kinzinger, the only two members of the GOP on the January 6 committee, 'Pelosi Republicans.'

'We've got very serious business here. We have important work to do,' she said to reporters on Capitol Hill.

The House of Representatives voted Monday night to kill a resolution from Republican leader Kevin McCarthy to get his picks on Nancy Pelosi's Capitol Riot Select Committee

Kinzinger told reporters on Monday that McCarthy 'can call me whatever names he wants,' before reassuring, 'I'm a Republican.'

'If the conference decided, or if Kevin decides, they want to punish Liz Cheney and I for getting to the bottom and telling the truth, I think that probably says more about them than it does for us,' he continued in response to the House Minority leader suggesting there could be consequences for the duo.

McCarthy answered 'we'll see' when asked Monday if he would punish Cheney of Wyoming and Kinzinger of Illinois for joining the Democrat-led January 6 select committee.

He called the duo of anti-Trump GOP lawmakers 'Pelosi Republicans.'

When asked when he had last talked to them he told DailyMail.com, 'Couldn't tell you.'

The GOP leader is under pressure from some members of his Republican caucus to crack down on Cheney and Kinzinger, who joined the panel investigating the MAGA riot at the invitation of Speaker Nancy Pelosi.

A spokesperson for Kinzinger added, 'It would speak volumes if he took away their committee assignments to 'punish them' for upholding their oath to protecting our democracy.'

McCarthy attended an event in the Rose Garden of the White House on Monday, marking the anniversary of the Americans with Disabilities Act. It put him in the same venue as Pelosi, who he's been arguing with over the formation of the 1/6 committee. Pelosi vetoed two of his Republican nominees to the panel and he pulled all his picks in return.

The two didn't interact during the event but McCarthy was spotted speaking to President Joe Biden afterward.

Pelosi and McCarthy shared a terse phone call, CNN reported, after Pelosi nixed Republican Reps. Jim Banks and Jim Jordan from serving.

'What you're doing is unprecedented,' McCarthy said.

The network reported that on the call voices were raised and McCarthy hinted that Pelosi's decision would come back to haunt her.

Pelosi had announced on Wednesday that she wouldn't allow the two Republicans, both staunch allies of Donald Trump, to serve on the committee that will probe the January 6 Capitol riot.

McCarthy attended the same event at the White House as House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who he had a terse phone call with last week, according to CNN, after she nixed two of the Republican members he selected for the committee - adding Kinzinger, an anti-Trump Republican, instead

Both Jordan and Banks voted to overturn the election the day of the insurrection.

Later Pelosi said she would appoint Kinzinger, a Republican Trump critic, to serve on the select committee instead. She announced Cheney's appointment last month.

Putting the two Republicans on the panel allows Pelosi to tout any findings as bipartisan.

'She's broken Congress. Then it just makes the whole committee sham and the outcome predetermined,' McCarthy told reporters at the White House on Monday.

Calls to punish Republicans investigating the Capitol riots have grown after Kinzinger accepted Pelosi's offer to serve on the Jan. 6 committee on Sunday.

He is the second Republican and outspoken Trump critic to take a seat on the committee at the behest of the House Speaker, Cheney joined the body earlier this month.

Kinzinger will join the other members at the committee's first hearing on Tuesday.

McCarthy last week pulled his five picks, which were given to Pelosi when she created the group. The move came after the speaker rejected Jordan and Banks.

Now, GOP members beyond the hard-right Freedom Caucus are calling for party leaders to remove the pair from other committees.

'There's a lot,' one Republican told CNN about the push. 'Supporting Pelosi's unprecedented move to reject McCarthy's picks was a bridge too far.'

Pelosi told ABC News on Sunday morning that Jordan and Banks would 'jeopardize the integrity of the investigation.'

Kinzinger agreed that the panel needed a 'serious, clear-eyed non-partisan approach'.

'Today, I was asked by the Speaker to serve on the House Select Committee to Investigate January 6th and I humbly accepted,' the Illinois congressman wrote in a statement Sunday afternoon.

'I'm a Republican dedicated to conservative values,' he continued, 'but I swore an oath to uphold and defend the Constitution - and while this is not the position I expected to be in or sought out, when duty calls, I will always answer.

'I will work diligently to ensure we get to the truth and hold those responsible for the attack fully accountable,' he said in his Sunday statement.

Both Cheney and Kinzinger voted for Trump's impeachment following the January 6 riot.

Kinzinger has been a vocal critic of the former president both on television and on social media. He strongly criticized his own political party, saying that the GOP is no longer focused on policy and has become all about 'loyalty' to Trump.

'I think what I'm used to saying to any Republican that's maybe kind of confused by the moment we're in is policy doesn't matter anymore. It literally is all your loyalty to Donald Trump. As I've said before, this is something that like echoes a little bit out of North Korea, where no matter what policy comes out, you're loyal to the guy,' he told NBC News' Meet the Press last month.

Cheney was voted out of her No. 3 leadership role in the party and replaced by loyalist Elise Stefanik for continually calling out Trump on his election lies.

There are no Trump supporters on the committee investigating the violent breach, which critics say was sparked by Trump's calls to 'stop the steal' and 'show strength' during a rally that same day.

McCarthy had previously warned freshman Republicans to look to Pelosi for future committee appointments if they accepted her invitation.

'Plenty of people wondering the same things,' another GOP member told CNN. 'If they are accepting appointments from Nancy Pelosi rather than the GOP, haven't they already effectively left? Perhaps they should ask Speaker Pelosi for committee assignments?'

McCarthy fumed after Kinzinger joined the panel, calling it not bipartisan – just made up of people hand-selected by Pelosi who all share her same view that Trump is to blame for the Capitol attack.

'Speaker Pelosi's rejection of the Republican nominees to serve on the committee and self-appointment of members who share her pre-conceived narrative will not yield a serious investigation,' McCarthy said in a Sunday statement after Kinzinger accepted a post on the panel.

He did not directly reference Kinzinger's willingness to accept the speaker's invitation.

'The Speaker has structured this select committee to satisfy her political objectives,' he added. 'She had months to work with Republicans on a reasonable and fair approach to get answers on the events and security failures surrounding January 6. Instead, she has played politics.'

The California Republican said the Senate has already conducted successful bipartisan investigations that 'should serve as a roadmap' for the January 6 select committee.

'Speaker Pelosi's departure from this serious-minded approach has destroyed the select committee's credibility,' he insisted.

It is not clear if Pelosi will tap any other GOP members to serve on the committee, but she did say 'other Republicans' have expressed interest in joining the panel.

ABC This Week host George Stephanopoulos pushed Pelosi on when she will make an announcement.

'Perhaps after I speak to Adam Kinzinger. But I'm not going to announce it right this minute,' she said just moments before approaching the Illinois Republican.

'You can say that that's the direction I would be going on,' she continued with a chuckle. 'He and other Republicans have expressed an interest to serve on the select committee.'

Pelosi said she 'wanted to appoint three of the members that Leader McCarthy suggested, but he withdrew their names.'

'The two that I would not appoint are people who would jeopardize the integrity of the investigation. And there's no way I would tolerate their antics as we seek the truth,' she told ABC News on Sunday morning.

McCarthy had put up Jordan, Banks, Troy Nehls of Texas, Kelly Armstrong of North Dakota and Rodney Davis of Illinois.

Jordan, Banks and Nehls all voted against certifying the 2020 election for Joe Biden by citing fraud in certain states on January 6.

Pelosi, as House Speaker, was able to veto only two.

'Unless Speaker Pelosi reverses course and seats all five Republican nominees, Republicans will not be party to their sham process and will instead pursue our own investigation of the facts,' McCarthy said last week.

'Pelosi has broken this institution,' he continued, while accusing the House speaker of an 'egregious abuse of power.'

Pelosi defended her decision to reject Jordan and Banks, saying their 'antics' were in danger of getting in the way of finding the truth behind what happened on January 6.

She said both lawmakers had a history of making statements that would have made it impossible for them to display 'balanced judgment,' including blaming the Biden administration for events that unfolded before it had even formed.

'It is my responsibility as Speaker of the House, to make sure we get to the truth on this, and we will not let their antics stand in the way of that,' she said during her weekly press briefing.

Pelosi said Sunday she would have appointed three McCarthy's picks, but 'the two that I would not appoint are people who would jeopardize the integrity of the investigation.' She's speaking of Reps. Jim Banks (left) and Jim Jordan's (right) who she rejected for the committee

Republicans warn there will be 'endless retaliation', according to a Sunday report, as the House becomes further divided.

'I didn't think things could get more partisan in the House than they already were,' a top Republican aide told the Washington Examiner. 'But Speaker Pelosi's decision to remove Republicans from the January 6th Committee just took things to an entirely new level.'

'When Republicans take back the House, expect endless retaliation,' the aide said.

The House currently sits at a 220-211 divide with Democrats holding the majority, but Republicans are putting all their efforts into flipping the body back to red in the 2022 midterms.

The Senate is split 50-50 with Vice President Kamala Harris holding the tie-breaking vote.

The panel begins its first hearing Tuesday into the violence that left five people dead after Trump supporters stormed the U.S. Congress as hey moved to certify the Electoral College results. It will hear from law enforcement officers who battled protesters.

The House select committee to investigate the Jan. 6 riot at the Capitol (above) is due to meet for the first time next week as it probes the attack on Congress that left five people dead

Last week, Pelosi hit back against critics who accused her of being intent on taking down Trump.

'We're there to get the truth, not to get Trump,' she said spelling it out.

'T-R-U truth. Trump that seems to be what the other side is obsessed with.

'So as legislation allows I didn't accept two of the five people were appointed, they had made statements and taken actions that I think would impact the integrity of the commission of the committee, the work as a committee,' she said.

'This is deadly serious. This is about our constitution, it's about our country.'

By way of example she cited a combative statement released by Banks last Monday in which he promised to use his role on the commission to investigate the response of the Biden administration to the riot.

'There was no Biden administration on January so let's not go into that,' she said.

Republicans were prepared to focus their strategy on why Pelosi wasn't more prepared for the attack.

'There's one fundamental question that I hope Democrats will actually answer and address and that is why wasn't there a proper security presence that day?' Jordan questioned after he was appointed by McCarthy.

'And frankly, only the speaker can answer that question so let's see if the Democrats bring that up,' he added.

Pelosi's spokesperson told DailyMail.com last Wednesday that the GOP strategy is 'desperate'.

'On January 6th, the Speaker, a target of an assassination attempt that day, was no more in charge of Capitol security than Mitch McConnell was,' Drew Hammill said. 'This is a clear attempt to whitewash what happened on January 6th and divert blame.'

At a rally in New York on July 25, right-wing protesters demanded the release of those arrested for participating in the Jan. 6 Capitol riot that left five people dead and windows smashed

They called for the release of more than 500 people arrested in connection with the breach

He added: 'I would hope the media would do better and treat this as the utter nonsense that it is.'

The GOP was also planning to highlight leftist political violence, including the 2020 summer riots and looting in response to police brutality.

'The Democrats in the summer of 2020 normalized anarchy, they normalized rioting and looting,' Jordan said. 'So I think that's an important element that we'll have to point out.'

In his statement, after being named to the committee by McCarthy, Banks also promised to address questions being ignored by Democrats.

'Even then, I will do everything possible to give the American people the facts about the lead up to January 6, the riot that day, and the responses from Capitol leadership and the Biden administration,' he said.

'I will not allow this committee to be turned into a forum for condemning millions of Americans because of their political beliefs.'

Two days later he accused Pelosi of running from the facts.

'I'm a sitting member of Congress and served my country in Afghanistan and the Speaker knows how hard I will fight for my country,' he said.

'We said all along that this was a purely partisan exercise by the Democrats and Nancy Pelosi's rejection of me and Jim Jordan shows once again she is the most partisan figure in America today.'

The Cambridges were among an estimated 25 million fans across Britain who watched Raheem Sterling and Harry Kane clinch England's position in the Euro quarters finals in the side's first knockout tournament win against Germany in 55 years tonight.

After the triumphant game at Wembley Stadium, the Duke and Duchess took to their official Twitter account to praise the team's 'incredible performance'.

The England squad will now head to Rome to play Ukraine in the Euro 2020 quarter-final on Saturday - after the team narrowly beat Sweden in the last minute of extra time.

At the stadium alone, 45,000 jubilant fans watched Gareth Southgate's fine-tuned side run rings around German captain Manuel Neuer's team all the way to the final whistle in a superb display of resilience and perseverance.

Waves of rapturous applause filled Wembley Stadium as Manchester City's Sterling first slotted the ball home, breaking a 0-0 first-half deadlock. Kane swiftly followed up with a neat header - sending his thrilled teammates piling on their captain in celebration as chants of 'it's coming home' filled the stadium.

Young Prince George was seen watching the match close to his avid football fan father Prince William, with the pair wearing matching suits and England ties. The Duke of Cambridge dotingly explained every twist and turn of the nail-biting match to his son - who is named after the patron saint of England - as they beamed from their box.

Football Association president William threw his fists into the air as his wife Kate clapped demurely when the final whistle blew.

In fan zones across the country - including in Manchester, Birmingham, Newcastle and London - overjoyed supporters were seen screaming as they celebrated.

HEADING TO ROME TO WATCH ENGLAND IN THE EURO 2020 QUARTER FINALS? NOT SO FAST England's 2-0 victory over Germany booked them a slot in the Euro 2020 quarter finals in Rome - but don't go booking yourself a city break just yet. Italy's Covid-19 restrictions mean that most England fans will struggle to get to the showdown with Ukraine. Here is what you need to know before jumping on a plane. - I just want to be in Rome, can I book a flight? Before you splash the cash, bear in mind you have to have proof of a negative coronavirus test taken in the 48 hours before you travel. Upon arrival, UK passengers must fill in one the of the European Union's passenger locator forms, before hunkering down for five days of isolation. Even if you touch down first thing on Wednesday, the earliest you will be out is Sunday - subject to a second Covid-19 test - meaning you will probably be watching the game from a hotel room. - Are there any exceptions? The only way you are likely to avoid the isolation requirement is if you are a member of transport crew, or can prove that you are in Italy for ""work, health or emergency"". If you fall into any of those categories, you can enter Italy but must leave within five days. Passengers transiting through the country are also exempt, as long as they have left Italy within 36 hours, as are EU officials, diplomats and international students returning to study. - If things had been different, would the German fans have had the same trouble? No. Germany is participating in the EU digital Covid-19 certificate scheme. The scheme proves that the carrier has been vaccinated against the virus, or that they have returned a negative test in the 48 hours before travel. As long as the traveller then fills out the EU passenger locator form, they would be free to enter Italy without five days of quarantine. - What if I decide to flout the rules? Breaking the rules could be pricey; anyone caught trying to end their five day quarantine period without proof of a negative test risks a 450 euros fine (£386), the Times reported. Those who skip quarantine all together could face a much tougher penalty - last year, Italy introduced fines of 3,000 euros (£2,580) for anyone who even tried to travel between regions, let alone cross its borders. - If I can get myself there, where can I get a ticket? That could be tricky. The FA has said it will not be selling tickets for the match to the England Supporters Travel Club (ESTC) - the official body of away support - due to Covid-19 restrictions. Instead it is hoping to get as many as tickets to England expats in Italy to make sure the team isn't playing in front of silent stands on Saturday, the Guardian reported. The statement said: 'Unfortunately, the FA will not be selling any tickets via the ESTC for this fixture given the travel restrictions in place across both countries, and as such are working with Uefa and the British embassy in Italy to facilitate as many ticket sales to English residents in Italy as possible.' - What do I have to do on my way home? Fans who overcome all obstacles to get themselves to Rome by Saturday will still have to self-isolate for 10 days upon return, as Italy is on the UK's amber list. Returning travellers will have to book a Covid-19 test for day two and day eight of their quarantine before flying. Passengers can also use the 'test to release' scheme where they pay for a private Covid-19 swab on day five of their quarantine - if the results on both day two and day five are negative, you can end your quarantine. The Government website says people should not travel to amber list countries or territories. Advertisement

The match kicked off to a nail-biting start, with West Ham player Declan Rice handed a yellow card in the first ten minutes.

And, just seconds before the half time whistle was blown, England captain Harry Kane had the ball robbed from him with the Germany goal wide open after a brilliant run by Raheem Sterling.

The second half saw Germany step up their play, but they still proved no match for Southgate's side - with a fantastic save by goalkeeper Jordan Pickford from Chelsea's Kai Havertz.

The crowd erupted into thunderous cheers when fan-favourite Jack Grealish replaced Bukayo Saka in the 68th minute, in a moved hoped to spark England's side into their first goal.

England midfielder Declan Rice added: 'It's incredible. It is history. All the players were asked about the past games, but we created history.' It took 74 minutes for Sterling to score the first goal and send the country into rapture.

As Germany pressed for an equaliser and fans’ nerves began fraying, captain Kane headed England into a 2-0 lead with five minutes to start pandemonium in the stands.

Summing up the mood of the nation, BBC commentator Guy Mowbray said: 'All around this famous stadium, it is fevered, frenzied excitement. This is one of the landmark football moments that don't come around too often.'

At the final whistle, the England players hugged each other as the significance of what they had achieved began to sink in.

After the match, Kane said: 'There isn’t anything bigger than this when the expectation is on and we delivered, so we should be proud but we can’t stop here. We have a vision of where we want to go and we can’t stop now. Hopefully we’ll be back here in the semi-finals and the final.'

Grealish took to Twitter to react after his team won. He wrote: 'England 2-0 Germany! What a day. Fans were UNBELIEVABLE.'

As jubilant supporters celebrated - with thousands pouring out onto the streets in Three Lions jerseys - roads were left eerily deserted.

Millions tuned in to watch the highly anticipated game, with pubs and bars packed out with fans who stayed on to celebrate.

After the match, England boss Southgate revealed he had told the players after the game that he must be the 'party-pooper'.

The win is a personal triumph for the manager, whose missed penalty in the semi-final of Euro 96 – also at Wembley – sent the Germans through.

'It's a brilliant afternoon,' Southgate told BBC Sport. 'We talked about bringing enjoyment to the nation really and afternoons like this are what that's about.

'The players were absolutely immense, right the way through the team and the fans were as well. Only 40,000, but it's as good an atmosphere as I can remember at Wembley.

'We played extremely well. I think we deserved the win, but I've had to say to them (the players) straight away, look, 'I'm the party-pooper because if we don't capitalise on that on Saturday now, then it doesn't count for anything'.'

Southgate was full of praise for both his goalscorers Sterling and Kane.

'Raheem, well they both have to constantly, has to prove people wrong all the time and Raheem has been immense for us over three, four years,' Southgate said told the BBC.

'He knows we've got faith in him, we've got that trust in him and his performances have been electric, right from the start.

'For Harry it was a really important moment I think. When you're a centre-forward it doesn't matter what else you're doing in the game, you need those goals and I was pleased to see the second one go in I have to say.'

Southgate was asked if his side's win helped ease the memory of his penalty shoot-out miss in 1996.

The former England defender said: 'I'm just so pleased. I was looking at the big screen and I saw David Seaman up there, the teammates that played with me, I can't change that, so that's always going to hurt.

'But what's lovely is we've given people another day to remember and now we've got to go and do it in Rome.'

The former Good Morning Britain host also shared a picture from Gareth Southgate's penalty miss at Euro 96 at Wembley against Germany and contrasted it to a joyous snap of the England manager from Tuesday's match.

'Redemption,' he wrote.

David Baddiel and Frank Skinner - who famously sang England anthem Three Lions - were also at Wembley and belted out the song alongside the other joyous supporters.

After the game, Baddiel shared a beaming picture alongside Olympic hero Mo Farah and wrote: 'Might be coming home a bit faster with this lovely fellow on hand.'

A tweet from Ant and Dec's official account read: 'This ... is ... AMAZING!!! A.'

Former England captain Wayne Rooney wrote on Instagram: 'Get in. Come on @england. Well done lads.'

Prime Minister Boris Johnson shared a picture showing him celebrating Kane's decisive goal.

He wrote: 'Well done England! We're all behind you - bring it home!'

Meanwhile, fans also shared their joy at England's triumph. Anthony Robinson, 34 - who lives in London and works in finance - watched the match with his mother Sue Bedding, 59, at the fan zone in Trafalgar Square.

Ms Bedding, an NHS worker, said she had come down from her home city of Nottingham so she could watch the match with her son.

Mr Robinson said: 'I feel ecstatic. You've got to be optimistic about things like this. In the first 15 to 20 minutes it didn't look like anything was going to happen, but the second half was brilliant.

'The atmosphere here was crazy. We're definitely pleased we came here to watch it. We were going to go to a pub to watch it but just thought, if England win it, to be here to watch it in Trafalgar Square is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. It's the next best thing to going to Wembley.

'The fact that we managed to win it in 90 minutes too and didn't have to go to penalties is incredible.'

Ms Bedding said: 'I'm made up, it's been an absolutely brilliant night. I remember the '96 match and I was completely gutted when we lost. So now I'm quite optimistic for the rest of the Euros.'

Following the Germany result, bookmakers Coral made England 2-1 favourites to win the tournament, cutting the Three Lions from 9-2.

Earlier, Neuer's team joined England players in taking the knee before the fixture in a stand against racism.

The protest act has been mired in controversy throughout the tournament, with the FA fearing unhappy crowds would boo players. But any discontent from spectators was drowned out by loud cheering from both sides.

The teams' national anthems were a different story, with boos ringing out from the England-heavy crowd as Germany's anthem played.

Both England captain Kane and his German counterpart Neuer wore rainbow armbands in support of Pride month during tonight's showdown.

Jack Grealish was dropped in favour of Kieran Trippier in the only major change by England boss Southgate ahead of the game.

Germany meanwhile made three alterations, with Chelsea's Timo Werner restored along with Leon Goretzka and Thomas Muller as Ilkay Gundogan, Serge Gnabry and Leroy Sane drop out of the side that drew 2-2 with Hungary.

The Three Lions have been pragmatic but somewhat underwhelming en route to the knockout stages, claiming two wins and a draw from their three Group D encounters without conceding a goal.

They now renew their long-standing rivalry with Germany, who squeezed through Group F - or the 'group of death' - to set up the eagerly-anticipated fixture.

Boris Johnson and Sir Keir Starmer both urged employers to let their staff finish work early to watch the contest as football fans piled into pubs and thousands of supporters descended on Wembley and let off flares.

Around 45,000 fans were allowed into Wembley to watch Southgate's squad battle the Germans for a place in the quarter-finals from 5pm, while millions more headed to their local - with some even hitting the boozers from as early as 7am this morning.

Three people were arrested at Wembley Stadium during tonight's match. Met Police confirmed one male was arrested for racially aggravated common assault, and two males were detained for fraud by false representation.

The Prime Minister and Labour leader both called on bosses to let their staff finish early amid fears some will be stuck in the office at kick-off.

Ahead of the match, Chancellor Rishi Sunak shared a photo of himself pulling on an England jersey with the caption: 'Bring it on.'

With just over an hour to kick off Wembley Way was a riot of colour with flag waving fans patiently queuing to take their seats.

Long queues stretched from the entrances to the stadium as fans had to show proof of vaccination or a negative lateral flow tests. Fans had been told to leave extra time to get into the ground to avoid missing the 5pm kick off.

Excitable fans let off red and white flares as they massed outside the stadium. With no alcohol allowed to be brought inside the stadium, thousands stood in Wembley Way drinking from cans and soaking up the atmosphere.

Two German supporters draped in their national flag were ignored as the fans were more interested in singing terrace songs, some referencing the war. But when a larger group walked past waving a black, yellow and red flag they were met boos and showered with beer prompting police to escort them to the ground.

An inflatable Spitfire was tossed among the crowd with one fan climbing up a tree to lead the chants.

The match is one of the most anticipated in recent memory, with fan parks sold out and more than five million pints expected to be bought. Supporters got into the swing of things early this morning with a beer garden in Sheffield filled with fans clutching pints and wearing England shirts at 7am.

Meanwhile the Kirby housing estate in London was also draped in dozens of England flags ahead of the game, in scenes mirrored across the nation.

Others took to social media to reveal they will be taking a sick day to ensure they can watch the match, with some lucky supporters revealing they will even be allowed to finish early by sympathetic bosses - meaning they will join around 22 million English fans set to tune in.

And one fan keen to join in on the fun wrote on Twitter today: 'I've got a stomach ache on the morning that England face Germany. I think my boss would kill me if I phoned in sick today! But I'm feeling [sick]. Damnit! Come on England!'

Police issued $15,000 in fines and arrested four men during a wild afternoon clash at Dandenong in Melbourne's southeast on Wednesday - amid fears the nightly walks could soon escalate into full scale riots.

In video shared on social media, police can be seen aiming pepper spray at walkers as officers tackle a man to the ground.

Confronting footage shows officers take a man down from behind by the neck amid screams from the crowd that he was simply going for a walk.

The man, who was not wearing a mask, was pulled off the road and tackled while other officers scurried to fend off the crowd.

Another man has a can of pepper spray pushed into his face and sprayed at near point blank range after shrugging off an officer and walking away.

Among those arrested were a a 28-year-old Dandenong man, who was subsequently charged with assaulting police, resisting arrest, failing to state his name and address and breaching the chief health officer directions.

A 19-year-old Dandenong man was also charged with use threatening words, failing to state his name and address and breaching the chief health officer directions while a 22-year-old Dandenong faces similar charges.

All three were released pending summons, but all nine were fined $1652 each for breaching the stage four lockdown restrictions.

Tensions in Dandenong - south east of Melbourne - have been flaring for days after a large group of residents decided to start walking at the same time and place.

Under Stage Four restrictions Melbourne residents can only leave their homes for four reasons, to buy essential items like groceries, for care or to give care, exercise and work.

There is also a nightly curfew from 8pm until 5am.

Photos show one of the men taken down by police covered in blood and grazes on his face.

Angry residents have already indicated the nightly walks could turn into a full blown riot.

'That female cop is a joke, on a power trip, the lot of them,' one person posted under a video of the arrest. 'They need to watch out, the riots will begin in no time.'

'Straight outta Nazi germany,' another posted. 'Probably were cryogenically (sic) frozen SS officers.'

Police have warned they will consider issuing penalty notices to anyone else found to be in breach of the directions issued by the Chief Health Officer.

Officers have been seen cruising the nightly walks and filming the crowds from the safety of their vehicles.

The uprising comes as the political stoush ramps up over a proposed 12-month extension to Victoria's state of emergency to deal with the COVID-19 pandemic.

Victoria recorded 23 deaths and 113 new coronavirus cases on Thursday - the lowest number of new cases for weeks.

Dozens of people, including women, children and families, can be seen thumbing their noses at Stage Four lockdown laws in Dandenong in video posted to social media on Tuesday.

The latest video emerged days after a video of police busting up a group exercise session in the same suburb was posted online.

In that video, a man filmed an expletive-laden rant in which he described mask-wearing police officers as 'Nazi dogs' and accused them of cashing in on the pandemic.

In a video posted by a Dandenong local on Tuesday night, police can be seen shadowing dozens of people as they walk along a busy street.

'Let the Nazis do their work,' someone is heard shouting as police cars appear around them.

Police officers can be seen marching down the middle of the road and shouting at the people to stay off the road.

'You get off the f**king road,' they respond.

'Youse are looking for it. Youse are dogs.'

A man is heard commentating as he conducts his hour-long walk within the allowed 5km radius of his home.

'People need to wake up. This is what we're dealing with here,' he says.

Residents can be heard booing police as they stop to question sections of the crowd.

'We pay them to follow us walk ... we pay these dogs to follow us walk,' the man says.

One officer can be seen with his pepper spray in hand ready to use at any moment.

When questioned, the man hands over his identification and explains that he is simply going for his hour-long walk.

Most of the walkers appear to be wearing masks.

The policeman warns the man he will be fined if he saw him again later that day on another walk.

At present, the declaration can only run for six months and will expire on September 13 along with Melbourne's Stage Four lockdown and regional Victoria's Stage 3 rules.

On Monday, Victoria premier Dan Andrews said his government won't be able to dictate guidelines such as mandatory mask use and isolation rules without a 12-month extension.

'We've got to protect public health, there can be no economic rebuilding until we fix this problem,' he told reporters.

The man in Tuesday's video warned that Melburnians were fed up with the current police state of Victoria.

'People are already starting to lose their minds,' he says as he continues his walk.

'Now imagine another year on top of that. Imagine the businesses that are going to go bankrupt. Imagine the suicides.'

On Monday, tempers flared when a convoy of nine police vehicles were seen pulling up to George Andrew reserve in Dandenong.

'Wake up you Nazi dogs, you are f****** Victoria Police you are not f****** Nazis!' a man in that video told police.

The angry resident, along with a number of other locals, confronted the officers after witnessing the squad cars pull into the park.

'Look at this? For what, for ten kids around here doing exercise, they are kids mate! Wake up to yourselves,' the man said.

He accused police of wasting tax payers money and state resources before asking if they 'feel great' about themselves while people around them had 'lost everything'.

'We lost our jobs, you have your jobs, we lost our homes, you have your homes,' the man said.

'You got a pay rise because of us mate!'

Victoria Police received close to a three percent pay rise after agreeing to a new deal with the State Government in December, 2019.

The Dandenong local became increasingly agitated after one of the officers told him 'we are all in this together'.

https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-10213553/Top-Democrat-believes-GOP-Rep-Paul-Gosars-AOC-anime-video-CRIMINAL.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490,1,"Paul Gosar retweeted the offensive anime video that showed AOC being murdered just moments after becoming the 24th House member in history to be formally censured.

The Republican congressman, who represents Arizona, was censured by the House and had his two committee assignments stripped after he posted the doctored anime video that depicted himself killing New York Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.

Two Republicans, Reps. Liz Cheney (Wyo.) and Adam Kinzinger (Ill.) voted for its censure. Rep. David Joyce (R-Ohio), a member of the House ethics committee, voted 'present.'

Moments after the vote, Gosar tweeted it again on Twitter, according to Newsweek.

He retweeted conservative podcaster Elijah Schaffer, who posted the 'murder' video within an hour of the House vote.

The new tweet was captioned by Schaffer: 'Really well done. We love @DrPaulGosar, don't we folks?'

Gosar's retweet was later removed.

Paul Gosar, who represents Arizona, was censured by the House and had his two committee assignments stripped after he posted a doctored anime video that depicted himself killing New York Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez

Gosar's tweet from last Sunday (pictured) featured a 92-second video with liberal US Rep Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's (AOC) face edited onto an amine clip and getting killed. It has since been taken down

Gosar on Twitter thanked his Republican colleagues 'for supporting me against the hysterical mob that is running the circus'.

He praised Representative Lauren Boebert (R-Colo.) for railing against Representative Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) as a member of the 'Jihad Squad' during the floor debate, and described the vote as 'kabuki theater.'

'I was surrounded by members of Congress who reject the kabuki theater we saw,' Gosar tweeted.

'This was an historic first to be surrounded by members in the Well of the House in solidarity against the mob of censors. Everyone knows this censure was theater.'

The 223-207 vote came after AOC tore into House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy Wednesday in an impassioned floor speech, as the body considered the censure resolution.

Following the vote, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi read the resolution aloud, with Gosar standing in the well of the chamber while backed by conservative Freedom Caucus members.

He was only the 24th member of Congress to be censured.

Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) lambasted House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy for being 'unable to condemn incitement of violence against a member of this body,' after he opposed a resolution to censure Rep. Paul Gosar (R-Ariz.)

'The House has resolved that Representative Paul Gosar of Arizona be censured, that representative Paul Gosar present yourself in the well of the House for the pronouncement of censure, that Representative Paul Gosasr be censured with the public reading of this resolution by the Speaker, and that Representative Paul Gosar be and is hereby removed from the Committee on Natural Resources and the Committee on Oversight and Reform,' Pelosi said.

Then she slammed down her gavel.

'That's it,' Pelosi could be heard saying when it was done, in a remark picked up by her mic.

The vote itself was not the climax of the day, with little doubt Democrats would prevail with their majority.

The most dramatic moment came when Ocasio-Cortez herself blasted McCarthy and Republicans for failing to confront Gosar over the incident.

'What is so hard? What is so hard about saying that this is wrong? This is not about me. This is not about Rep. Gosar. But this is about what we are willing to accept,' said Ocasio-Cortez.

'What I believe is unprecedented is for a member of House leadership of either party to be unable to condemn incitement of violence against a member of this body,' she said.

'It's sad. It's a sad day.'

The chamber featured angry accusations, a bizarre historical analogy, and long lists of grievances against past officials for their own statements or transgressions.

It culminated with a speech by Ocasio-Cortez, whose face appears in the video Gosar posted days ago on his official Twitter account. Gosar attacks her with two swords, in a video he said in his defense on Wednesday was about illegal immigration.

The second-term lawmaker spoke immediately after McCarthy – who described the vote as a slippery slope – and threatened it sets a precedent where a variety of Democrats who have made inflammatory statements would be stripped of their committee assignments in the future.

'It's a sad day in which a member who leads a political party in the United States of America cannot bring themselves to say that issue of a depiction of murdering a member of Congress is wrong, [and] instead decides to venture off into a tangent about gas prices. And inflation. What is so hard?' she intoned.

'This nihilism runs deep,' she said.

'It conveys and betrays a certain contempt for the meaning and importance of our work here. That what we do, so long as we claim that it is a joke, doesn't matter. That what we say here doesn't matter. That our actions every day as elected leaders in the United States of America doesn't matter. That this chamber and what happens in it doesn't matter ... And I'm here to rise to say that it does.'

'Do you think that should happen on a school board?... And if it's not acceptable there, why should it be accepted here?' she said.

She called it part of a trend of 'of misogyny, and racial misogyny, racist misogyny.'

'What is so hard? What is so hard about saying that this is wrong?' Ocasio-Cortez said

'This is not about me. This is not about Representative Gosar. But this is about what we are willing to accept,' she said

Republican Representative from Arizona Paul Gosar defended the video and compared himself to Alexander Hamilton

She slammed McCarthy for failing to rein in his colleague, who didn't publicly apologize, and says he did not apologize to his conference.

'This is not about me. This is not about Representative Gosar. But this is about what we are willing to accept,' she said.

She spoke after McCarthy denounced the effort as a power grab.

He said repeatedly it was an example of 'Rules for thee, but not for me' by the Democrats, and pointed to inflammatory statements by House Democrats.

'It's about control. It's not about a standard that everybody lives by.'

Then he focused on the move to strip Gosar of his committee seats, and said the precedent being established by Speaker Nancy Pelosi could boomerang.

'Under the Pelosi precedent, all the members I mentioned will need the approval of a majority to keep those positions in the future,' he said.

His Democratic counterpart, Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, rejected his claims.

'What Rep. Gosar did last week is not only worthy of censure. It demands it,' he said.

'No one, Democrat or Republican, ought to be allowed to engage in the promotion of violence against a fellow member or indeed a fellow American. Can't that appall you, even that act? Do you have no shame?' he said.

Pelosi herself said the threats 'specifically target a woman.'

She added: 'This is about workplace harassment and violence against women.'

Gosar rose to his own defense, countering claims against him by saying the video he posted was not dangerous or threatening, and not even bothering to address his committee posts or the historic nature of a censure.

'It was not my purpose to make anyone upset. I voluntarily took the cartoon, not because it was a threat, but because some thought it was,' Gosar said.

He said his staff posted the video, which he described as 'depicting a policy battle' over amnesty.

'Even Twitter, the left's mouthpiece, did not remove the cartoon,' he said, invoking the media platform's controversial policy.

'There is no threat in the cartoon other than the threat that immigration poses to our country,' he said.

Then he cast the effort to sanction him as ideological.

'No matter how much the left tries to quiet me, I will continue to speak out,' he said.

'If I must join Alexander Hamilton, the first person attempted to be censured by this House, so be it. It is done,' he said, walking away from a rostrum on the House floor.

Two Democrats picked up on his attempt to compare himself to Hamilton.

'It's ironic that Mr. Gosar compares himself to Alexander Hamilton, and another member condoned the stylized violence portrayed by Mr. Gosar, because Hamilton was actually killed by accepted high class violence in his day, in a duel,' said Rep. Debbie Wasserman-Schultz.

'Mr. Gosar: you are no Alexander Hamilton,' said Rep. David Cicilline (D-R.I.). 'You must be held accountable.'

Hamilton was serving as Washington's Treasury secretary when he was accused of mishandling loans.

Rep. Peter Meijer (R-Mich.), who backed the effort to impeach Donald Trump after the Jan. 6 riot, did not join the effort, although he released a statement saying Gosar has 'disgraced himself' in the past. He said it was a 'dumb anime clip' that was 'contemptible' but 'calling that video a death threat is an unreasonable exaggeration.

Several Democrats, including some who have suffered threats themselves, raised issues of political violence, while multiple Republicans defended Gosar, even if not the video itself.

Rep. Kelly Armstrong (R-N.D.) was one of the few to slam the video outright, while opposing the censure effort.

'It was dumb. It was silly. It was stupid. It was mean-spirited. But you know what it's not? It's not incitement of violence. And when we use hyperbole and those words, we cause ourselves problems,' he said.

Rep. Tom Rice (R-S.C.) echoed the point. 'Is it inappropriate? Yes. Childish? Of course. Stupid? Without question. But is it a threat? Absolutely not.'

House Republicans began the task of defending Gosar, with Rules Committee Chairman Rep. Tom Cole (R-Okla.) saying a move to strip Gosar's committee assignments 'tramples on the traditional norms of the House.'

Cole called the video itself 'certainly provocative, and in my opinion inappropriate,' but accused Democrats of trying to 'play politics with this moment.'

House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer called the video 'vile, hateful, outrageous, dangerous and inciting to violence against a colleague.'

'This may be a criminal act as well as an act that certainly brings dishonor to the House of Representatives,' Hoyer told reporters Tuesday.

'That we would get to this low level of actions with colleagues, it's totally unacceptable, and action must be taken.'

Rep. Mary Gay Scanlon (D-Pa.) on the House floor blasted the video as 'fantasized violence' that could have a real world effect.

'This Congress knows what happens when members of the radical right get stirred up by their leaders. Just a few month ago, this Congress had to hide in safe rooms under the protection of police and soldiers,' she said in a reference to January 6th - and on a day 'QAnon shaman' Jacob Chansley was sentenced to 41 months in prison for his role in the Capitol riot.

Gosar joins a group that includes a list of confederates censured for disloyalty to the union, lawmakers who sold appointments, people who used 'unparliamentary language,' and one lawmaker who violated a 'gag rule' by speaking in favor of a slave rebellion (see chart below).

Gosar, 62, told 'The Stew Peters Show' Tuesday: 'I did not apologize. This video had nothing to do with harming anybody.

'It's exactly what you're talking about. It's an anime. You are trying to reach out to the newer generation that likes these anime, these cartoons fabricated in Japanese likeness to actually tell them what is harmful in this bill [Biden's Build Back Better plan] that they're missing.'

The last member to be so censured was longtime New York Rep. Charles Rangel, who was stripped of his powerful Ways and Means Committee after a long fight that culminated in the censure, over misuse of congressional letterhead for fundraising and filing inaccurate financial reports and tax returns.

Speaking behind closed doors on Tuesday, Gosar reportedly said he had not seen the violence before it was posted, and that he was trying to reach a younger audience. He sent the video on his official Twitter account.

The censure resolution notes that defense as one of its clauses, which highlighted violence against women.

'Whereas, on November 7, 2021, Representative Paul Gosar posted a manipulated video on his social media accounts depicting himself killing Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and attacking President Joseph Biden,' it begins.

It states that 'depictions of violence can foment actual violence and jeopardize the safety of elected officials,' and references the January 6 riot.

'Whereas violence against women in politics is a global phenomenon meant to silence women and discourage them from seeking positions of authority and participating in public life, with women of color disproportionately impacted,' the resolution states.

Democrats could pass it on a simple majority.

One Republican, Rep. Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.), said before the vote that Gosar should be censured 'for his continued indefensible activities.'

She sits on the House Select Committee on Jan. 6th.

'That is an insult, not only endangerment of that member of Congress, but an insult to the institution of the House of Representatives,' said House Speaker Nancy Pelosi Tuesday.

'We cannot have members joking about murdering each other, as well as threatening the President of the United States,' she said.

Events at Tuesday night's Rules Committee hearing foreshadowed a tense debate.

'What do you stand for? Do you stand for violence against women, or do you stand against it?' asked Rep. Norma Torres (D-Calif.).

'It's almost as if we've elevated this and made it more of a problem than it ever was,' said Rep. Michael Burgess (R-Tex.).

Republicans also complained that the matter didn't go before the bipartisan House Ethics Committee.

The resolution stripped Gosar of his seat on the House Government Oversight and Reform Committee, where Ocasio-Cortez also sits.

The resolution is authored by Rep. Jackie Speier (D-Calif.), who survived the Jonestown massacre and came forward in 2017 to describe being sexually assaulted as a young congressional staffer.

Paul Gosar Whereas, on November 7, 2021, Representative Paul Gosar posted a manipulated video on his social media accounts depicting himself killing Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and attacking President Joseph Biden; Whereas the video was posted on Representative Gosar's official Instagram account and used the resources of the House of Representatives to further violence against elected officials; Whereas Representative Gosar issued a statement on November 9, 2021, defending the video as a 'symbolic cartoon' and spreading hateful and false rhetoric about immigrants; Whereas the leadership of the Republican Party has failed to condemn Representative Gosar's threats of violence against the President of the United States and a fellow Member of Congress; Whereas the Speaker of the House made clear that threats of violence against Members of Congress and the President of the United States should not be tolerated and called on the Committee on Ethics of the House and law enforcement to investigate the video; Whereas depictions of violence can foment actual violence and jeopardize the safety of elected officials, as witnessed in this chamber on January 6, 2021; Whereas violence against women in politics is a global phenomenon meant to silence women and discourage them from seeking positions of authority and participating in public life, with women of color disproportionately impacted; Whereas a 2016 survey by the Inter-Parliamentary Union found that 82 percent of women parliamentarians have experienced psychological violence and 44 percent received threats of death, sexual violence, beatings, or abduction during their term; Whereas the participation of women in politics makes our government more representative and just: Now, therefore, be it 1 Resolved, That Representative Paul Gosar of Arizona be 3 censured; Representative Paul Gosar forthwith 5 present himself in the well of the House of Representatives for the pronouncement of censure; and Representative Paul Gosar be censured with the public reading of this resolution by the Speaker.

During a closed-door G.O.P. conference meeting, Gosar said he did not support violence against members of Congress and had removed the video after criticism.

'It was not his intent to ever harm anybody,' House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy told reporters afterwards, according to The Hill.

And Politico reported Gosar told his colleagues that he didn't intend to encourage violence, but was trying to appeal to 'a younger audience.'

'McCarthy told members at conference that Rs should be united on this & that Dems don't punish their own for comments,' tweeted reporter Olivia Beavers.

But the controversy comes amid a rise in threats to lawmakers, who feel particularly vulnerable in the wake of the Jan. 6 attack on Congress.

The video shows a sword-wielding character with Gosar's superimposed face using a jetpack to soar onto a rooftop before attacking Ocasio-Cortez, striking her with the weapon as blood flies out of her.

'The cartoon depicts the symbolic nature of a battle between lawful and unlawful policies and in no way intended to be a targeted attack against Representative Cortez or Mr. Biden,' said Gosar last week.

'It is a symbolic cartoon. It is not real life. Congressman Gosar cannot fly.'

Gosar is a close ally of former President Trump's and embraced his false claims that the election was stolen from him.

The original video is from the Japanese anime series Attack on Titan, a violent series where the protagonist and his allies kill titans with human forms. But the doctored version includes Biden and Ocasio-Cortez's faces projected on to villains.

Ten Democrats introduced a resolution to censure Gosar.

'As the events of January 6th have shown, such vicious and vulgar messaging can and does foment actual violence. Violence against women in politics is a global phenomenon meant to silence women and discourage them from seeking positions of authority and participating in public life, with women of color disproportionately impacted,' they said.

Liz Cheney, dumped out of a party leadership role earlier this year for her opposition to former President Trump, accused McCarthy of lacking strength after he failed to condemn Gosar immediately.

'In a moment where you've got an avowed white nationalist in Rep. Gosar who has posted a video advocating the killing of another member, the idea that our leader will not stand against that but that he's somehow going after and allowing attacks against 13 members who are conducting themselves in a serious and substantive way is really outrageous,' she told the Associated Press.

Pelosi has gone even further, calling on the House Ethics Committee and federal law enforcement to investigate Gosar.",Top Democrat believes GOP Rep. Paul Gosar's AOC anime video could be CRIMINAL,1
https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2024/nov/21/msf-aid-workers-heartbroken-as-charity-forced-to-halt-services-in-haitian-capital-after-repeated-attacks,1,"Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) has said its aid workers are “heartbroken” after the medical NGO was forced to suspend all of its healthcare services in Port-au-Prince for the first time in three decades, leaving Haitians in the violence-ravaged capital without a critical lifeline.

The international non-profit said it had no choice but to halt all operations on Wednesday after staff were repeatedly attacked and received death threats from armed vigilantes and the national police.

“Suspending the activities of MSF in Haiti has been a heartbreaking decision,” said Diana Manilla Arroyo, MSF’s head of mission for the country. “We have been in Haiti for more than 30 years and we know that healthcare services have never been as limited for the Haitian people as they are now.”

The indefinite suspension of MSF’s Haiti operations follows an incident earlier this month where armed police officers and vigilante groups stopped an MSF ambulance carrying three young gunshot victims.

The armed men slashed the ambulance’s tires and teargassed MSF staff inside the vehicle to force them outside before shooting two of the patients dead, the NGO said.

The organisation had hoped to continue working despite the incident but staff have faced death and rape threats another four times since, making its operations untenable, Arroyo said. “MSF works in many parts of the world with high levels of insecurity, however, we expect minimum levels of safety for our teams.”

MSF has paused services at particular facilities in Haiti on several occasions in recent years due to gang violence, including occasions where bullets have flown through hospitals. However, it has never ceased operations entirely, a move that will leave nearly 5,000 patients a month without medical care.

The decision is a blow to Haitians who are facing the worst hunger crisis in the western hemisphere while caught in the crossfire of brutal gang wars.

Hospitals have been burned down in violent insurrections this year, doctors have been murdered and essential medical supplies have dried up, leaving 2 million people in Port-au-Prince with scant options for medical attention.

Aid workers provide a vital lifeline for Haitians seeking treatment for soaring prevalence of gunshot wounds, severe malnutrition and sexual violence.

MSF’s five hospitals treat more than 1,000 patients a week on average, including 50 children with emergency conditions and more than 80 survivors of sexual and gender-based violence.

Patients are frequently referred to the NGO’s hospitals by other civil society groups, as it is one of the few organisations equipped to treat the most complex and life threatening cases, said Flavia Maurello, head of the Italian charity AVSI in Haiti.

“All of us are affected by this decision and we must now try to figure out how to cope with it,” said Maurello.

Haiti has fallen into ever-deepening insecurity, chaos and political turmoil since its president Jovenel Moïse was assassinated in July 2021.

Armed gangs, which control 80% of the capital, forced out Moise’s successor, Ariel Henry, in March.

Garry Conille was tasked with stabilising the country when he was named prime minister by the country’s transitional presidential council in May, but he too was sacked last week as gangs ran riot in the capital terrorising the local population.

The country has pinned much of its hope of restoring order on an UN-backed international security mission, but only 400 Kenyan police officers have been deployed to the Caribbean nation so far and have failed to turn the tide.

At least 28 people were killed this week as the gangs came together to lay siege to neighbourhoods such as Haut Delmas and Pétion-Ville – upmarket neighbourhoods previously considered safe havens.

If the armed groups succeed in expanding their control of the capital, the city could be cut off from the rest of the country and the world, said Laurent Uwumuremyi, Mercy Corps’ country director for Haiti.

“If Port-au-Prince becomes completely cut off, the humanitarian consequences will be catastrophic. Hospitals, already overwhelmed, will run out of essential supplies,” said Uwumuremyi. “Food insecurity will escalate to famine-like conditions, and access to clean water and health services will deteriorate further. The isolation of the capital would sever Haiti’s lifeline to international aid and exacerbate the suffering of millions.”

MSF said it has asked the police, the transitional presidential council and the international security force to guarantee its safety so it can resume its operations.",MSF aid workers ‘heartbroken’ as charity forced to halt services in Haitian capital after repeated attacks,1
https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/article/2024/aug/13/regional-australia-institute-report-we-cannot-simply-aim-to-reach-net-zero-at-any-cost,1,"There is growing discontent on the plains of western Victoria as renewable energy companies chase the region’s abundance of sun and wind.

The Wimmera Southern Mallee region, home to prosperous cropping and cattle farms, is in a renewable energy zone, earmarked for wind and solar farms and transmission lines.

But a lack of engagement from governments and energy companies has left farmers and local businesses worried for their future, according to the Wimmera Southern Mallee Development’s chief executive, Chris Sounness.

“People who have fear in their heart for a whole range of reasons do get really worked up,” Sounness said. “I sat in a meeting where a farmer said, ‘The only way this project goes ahead is when I get carried out in a coffin.’

“When someone is at that point in their thinking, there’s very little space to go forward … everybody wants to support that person.”

Research by the Regional Australia Institute released on Tuesday shows that residents feel like an afterthought in a region crucial to federal and state energy policy.

“[This] has happened quickly and has been seen as top-down, clashing with the long-held lifestyle and history of local people,” the institute’s Towards Net Zero – Empowering Regional Communities report said.

It was one of six regions profiled by the institute to gauge the needs of communities at the forefront of the energy transition.

Across most of the regions, including central Queensland’s Banana shire and South Australia’s Upper Spencer Gulf, there is a sense that renewables are an opportunity for economic gain.

But communities need improved engagement from governments, a commitment to use local workers, as well as more housing, healthcare and early education.

“We cannot simply aim to reach net zero at any cost,” said the institute’s chief executive, Liz Ritchie. “It must be done in a way that is just and provides local opportunities, in an efficient manner, with an equity of outcomes for all Australians.

“And the clock is ticking.”

Among the report’s recommendations is the creation of a “prosperity collective” that combines governments, industries and communities to direct investment where it’s needed most.

“Above all else … communities saw the transition as an opportunity to build a lasting legacy for future generations,” the report said. “To fully harness the transition’s potential, regional communities want practical and accessible transition advice, rather than high-level targets and strategic ambitions.”

Sounness, whose organisation promotes responsible growth through renewables, agriculture and tourism, said energy companies would have to stick by rural communities for decades.

“How are these towns going to be better off? The companies and the government can’t say quite yet,” he said. “So all they’re doing is creating an opportunity for fear and misinformation to run riot.”

Trump also tore into Judge Arthur Engoron, a day after the judge ordered him to take down online attacks on his own clerk.

Trump accused the judge of taking part in 'election interference' who he described as taking orders from national Democrats.

'They made up a fake case, fraudulent people, and the judge already knows what he's going to do. He's a Democrat judge, in all fairness to him. He has no choice.'

'He's run by the Democrats,' Trump complained. 'He’s controlled and it’s a shame.'

After making the angry statement, Trump left the courthouse for the day, during a contentious day in court where his lawyers were able to undercut the accountant for the Mazars firm that handled his account.

He said he would rather be on the campaign trail – even though he made a voluntary appearance in court for the third consecutive day.

Former President Donald Trump tore into AG Letitia James on the third day of his civil fraud trial in New York, a day after a judge slapped a gag order on him

'I'd rather be in New Hampshire or South Carolina, or Ohio or a lot of other places. But I'm stuck here because I have a corrupt attorney general that communicates with the DOJ in Washington to keep it nice and busy,' he said.

Trump was back in court for his third consecutive day Wednesday, ripping his adversaries once again.

The judge imposed a limited gag, ordering him not to personally attack court staff, and telling him to delete the 'disparaging, untrue and personally identifying post.'

Trump had called the clerk Senate Majority Leader Charles Schumer's 'girlfriend' and posted a link to her instagram account while attacking her guidance to a judge he has called 'deranged.' He also on Tuesday called James a 'Monster' and a 'Deranged Lunatic.'

The judge said in court Tuesday: 'Consider this statement an order forbidding all parties from posting, emailing or speaking publicly about any members of my staff.

He said failure to abide by it 'will result in serious sanctions.'

After taking the post down, Trump trained much of his fire on James – while also accusing her of bringing an unconstitutional prosecution by bringing a case under New York Executive Law.

Trump also specifically took on legal critics who have faulted his own attorney, Alina Habba, for failing to check a box requesting a jury trial in the matter.

Trump has repeatedly attacked the trial, where Judge Engoron will decide on James' request for $250 million in damages, as unfair.

Trump left court for the day after the angry tirade

'This witch hunt has gone on using statute 63 (12). Consumer fraud statute. It doesn't allow any juries, doesn't allow me anything. We have a prosecutor Letitia James who is incompetent,' he fumed, accusing her of forcing companies to abandon the state while 'violent crime in particular runs rampant.'

'So this witch hunt does not allow me a hearing. That can't be possible [because] somebody didn't check a box. Has nothing to do with it. Under 63 (12) you are not entitled to a jury. First time it's ever been used for a purpose like this. Never been used. They used it on me, the former president, the leading candidate, leading Joe Biden by a lot, which is probably why this is all happening. Not probably – definitely they are coordinating with Washington 100 per cent.'

'This trial is a disgrace,' Trump said.

Trump lawyer Alina Habba has denied the criticism. 'I didn't forget to check a box,' she said on Fox News.

Trump lawyer Alina Habba, right, has denied being the cause of the non-jury trial by failing to check a box requesting a jury

Fox contributor Leo Terrell, a lawyer and talk host, said there 'usually are some forms where you have to make a check,' and said he was 'perplexed' at Trump's legal team for failing to appeal a non-jury trial.

Former U.S. Attorney Harry Litman called the decision 'mind-blowing' after Judge Engoron said in court that a jury trial had not been requested.

'I had heard this rumor, and now the judge just confirmed it. It is mind-blowing. For Trump to have his fate in the hands of this judge, whom he has vilified, is malpractice by his lawyers and very ominous for him,' he wrote on X, the former Twitter site.

Trump called his prosecution 'the beginning of communism.'

Trump once again defended his financing arrangements with lenders, pointing to disclaimers in asset valuations his company provided.

'You borrow money, you pay it back, and you get sued by a political animal. That's where we are,' he said.

If Trump is found to violate the gag order he could face up to 30 days in jail and a $1,000 fine.

It came after he tore into Engoron's clerk Alison Greenfield – and called her Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer's 'girlfriend.'

He had claimed she 'is running this case against me. How disgraceful!' and posted a link to her Instagram account.

Trump's comments came in a courthouse rant where he said he was 'open' to being speaker of the House as after a handful of right-wing Republicans floated his name for the top job.

'A lot of people have asked me about it,' Trump said during a press conference Wednesday morning.

'We're leading by like 50 points for president. My focus is totally on that. If I can help them during the process, I would do it. But we have some great people in the Republican party. They will do a great job as speaker,' he went on.

'I'll do whatever it is to help but my focus is being president,' Trump added.

Speaker Kevin McCarthy was ousted in a historic vote on a motion to vacate brought forth by GOP Rep. Matt Gaetz, Fla.

Eight Republicans sided with all Democrats to push out their leader - making McCarthy the shortest-lived speaker in 140 years and the first one ever to be pushed out in the middle of his term.

Speaker Kevin McCarthy was ousted in a historic vote on a motion to vacate brought forth by GOP Rep. Matt Gaetz , Fla.

Gaetz claimed he had the backing of Trump in his efforts, but Trump posted on Truth Social in the midst of the drama: 'Why is it that Republicans are always fighting among themselves, why aren’t they fighting the Radical Left Democrats who are destroying our Country?'

But according to the House GOP's own bylaws, Trump would be barred from holding the top job.

'A member of the Republican Leadership shall step aside if indicted for a felony for which a sentence of two or more years imprisonment may be imposed,' Republican conference rules state.

'The only candidate for Speaker I am currently supporting is President Donald J. Trump,' Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., wrote on X.

'@realDonaldTrump for Speaker,' Rep. Greg Steube, R-Fla., added.

'Kevin McCarthy will NOT be running again as Speaker. I nominate Donald J. Trump for Speaker of the House,' said Rep. Troy Nehls, R-Texas.

But Trump has been indicted four times in the last six months. He's been indicted on 91 federal and state charges and faces hundreds of years in prison if convicted on all counts.

Two of the cases are federal - one related to his handling of classified documents and one related to his efforts to overturn the 2020 election results and the January 6, 2021 Capitol riot.

There is no consensus yet on who will be the next speaker of the House.

Since McCarthy's ouster Majority Leader Steve Scalise and Judiciary Chair Jim Jordan have emerged as frontrunners to take on the top job and have begun making calls to rank-and-file offices to gauge support.

The Canberra Raiders player, 22, was arrested alongside three other men at the Shady Palms restaurant in Kincumber, on the Central Coast, on Saturday night.

It is understood the Starling was celebrating the 21st birthday of Newcastle Knight Connor Watson's brother with a group of family and NRL friends.

The brawl started after a derogatory comment was made about Starling's mother but the 22-year-old claimed he never threw a punch, The Daily Telegraph reported.

The Canberra Raiders player (pictured left with girlfriend Chelsea) allegedly attacked police alongside two other men, 20 and 24, after a 19-year-old man was arrested

The altercation reportedly began after Starling's brother claimed he overheard a comment made towards his mother when she was on her way to the bathroom.

It is claimed Starling was told about the incident by other guests and jumped a railing to the downstairs section of the restaurant to help his brother.

The 22-year-old will claim that he was set upon and was not intentionally trying to cause any trouble.

A statement from NSW Police said officers arrived at 10.45pm 'after assistance was requested by security for a patron that was failing to leave the venue.'

'The 19-year-old man was arrested and while he was being escorted from the venue, police will allege three other men – aged 20, 22 and 24 – became aggressive and assaulted police numerous times in an attempt to intervene,' the statement said.

All four men were arrested with the help of the Public Order and Riot Squad and taken to Gosford Police Station.

A male senior constable sustained a cut to his hand and was assessed by paramedics at the scene but no other officers were injured in the fight.

Starling was charged with five counts of assaulting an officer in execution of duty, affray and resisting or hindering a police officer in the execution of duty.

He spent the night in custody before attending Gosford Hospital to seek medical treatment.

All of the men were granted conditional bail to appear at Gosford Local Court in January.

It is understood Starling spoke with club officials at length on Sunday to give his version of the incident.

The Canberra Raiders released a statement confirming the club and the NRL were aware of the incident on Sunday morning.

'The Canberra Raiders have been made aware of an incident involving Tom Starling overnight,' the statement said.

'The club has informed the NRL integrity unit. The club will not be making further comment.'

The country's parliament building was set alight by furious rioters who threw fireworks and stones, while an effigy of Bidzina Ivanishvili, the shadowy founder of the ruling Georgian Dream (GD) party, was stuffed on a stake and set alight to whoops and cheers from the crowd.

Fireworks were also thrown as riot police, with one video showing a lone protester taking aim at cops with a firework 'machine gun'.

Police were accused of brutalising protesters. Witnesses reported seeing protesters in Tbilisi being chased and beaten by police as demonstrators rallied in front of the country's parliament.

One video showed a woman lying weakly on the ground and a police officer kicked her head, before she collapsed as a second cop ran up and kicked her.

Observers could be heard screaming as they witnessed the violent scene. Officials said that 44 people were hospitalised by police-deployed water cannons and tear gas.

The country's interior ministry has since confirmed that around 107 people were taken into custody following the violent clashes on Friday. The number of people arrested last night is still not known.

Georgia's prime minister Irakli Kobakhidze, who was re-elected in the October election, said president Salome Zourabichvili would have to leave office at the end of her term this month despite her statement that she will refuse to do so.

Zourabichvili said on Saturday she would stay in office because the new parliament was illegitimate and had no authority to name her successor.

Kobakhidze warned that 'any violation of the law will be met with the full rigor of the law'.

'Neither will those politicians who hide in their offices and sacrifice members of their violent groups to severe punishment escape responsibility,' he said at a briefing on Sunday.

He also accused unspecified 'foreign entities' of working on the 'Ukrainisation' of Georgia with a 'Maidan-style scenario' - a reference to Ukraine's 2014 Maidan revolution which ousted the country's Moscow-friendly president and unleashed a decade of momentous change for Ukraine, eventually leading to its current war with Russia.

Mr Kobakhidze also dismissed the US State Department's statement on Saturday that it was suspending its strategic partnership with Georgia. The statement condemned Georgia's decision to halt its efforts towards EU accession.

'You can see that the outgoing administration is trying to leave the new administration with as difficult a legacy as possible. They are doing this regarding Ukraine, and now also concerning Georgia,' Mr Kobakhidze said of the US.

'This will not have any fundamental significance. We will wait for the new administration and discuss everything with them.'

Since the ruling Georgian Dream (GD) party claimed victory in October elections which the opposition said were fraudulent, the government has stoked outrage by delaying EU membership talks, a move that has caught the ire of more than 100 serving Georgian diplomats, who signed a letter decrying the government's decision.

'We believe that removing the opening of EU accession negotiations from the political agenda until 2028 contradicts the requirements of Article 78 of the Constitution of Georgia,' the diplomats said in a joint statement.

'We remain committed to Georgia's course of European and Euro-Atlantic integration', they added.

But the election was marred by accusations from observers that voters, particularly public sector workers, were pressured into voting for GD, with the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) accusing the party of ballot stuffing and vote buying.

The party was originally forecast to get just 35 per cent of the vote in last months election, but managed to later walk away with 54 per cent of the vote.

The European Parliament this week voted to 444-72 to declare the parliamentary election results in the South Caucasus country invalid, claiming they 'do not serve as a reliable representation of the will of the Georgian people.'

It also called for the election to be re-run within a year under international supervision.

But Kobakhidze also ruled out holding fresh parliamentary elections amid a post-election crisis that has seen his legitimacy questioned both at home and internationally.

'Of course not,' he told journalists when asked whether the ruling Georgian Dream party, which claimed victory in the contested October elections, would agree to hold a new vote as demanded by the country's president, opposition, and the European Parliament.

Zourabichvili said her country is becoming a 'quasi-Russian' state and that Georgian Dream controls the major institutions.

'We are not demanding a revolution. We are asking for new elections, but in conditions that will ensure that the will of the people will not be misrepresented or stolen again,' she said.

'Georgia has been always resisting Russian influence and will not accept having its vote stolen and its destiny stolen.'

According to opinion polls, becoming a part of the European Union was a popular choice among many in the country, with joining the diplomatic mission being a part of Georgia's constitution.

But Kobakhidze said he would be utilising a 'diplomatic response' if the EU tried to interfere in Georgia any further.

Kobakhidze said that his government is committed to facilitating Georgia's integration into the EU by the desired 2030 timeline.

He said: 'Our approach to this goal is through peace, dignity and prosperity, not blackmail. We will not tolerate manipulation or attempts to divide our society through artificial means.'

The EU granted Georgia candidate status in December 2023 on condition that it meets the bloc's recommendations.

But it put its accession on hold and cut financial support earlier this year after the passage of a 'foreign influence' law widely seen as a blow to democratic freedoms.

The precinct was abandoned by officers on May 28 on the orders of Mayor Jacob Frey. The move came as a desperate attempt to de-escalate the riots that raged following George Floyd’s death under the knee of Derek Chauvin, 44, on Memorial Day.

The disgraced former cop had been stationed at the Third Precinct, which became a target for looters and arsonists in the violent and chaotic nights that followed Floyd’s death.

Branden Wolfe, 23, appeared on Tuesday via video-link to the US District Court in St Paul and his case was heard before Magistrate Judge Hildy Bowbeer.

Wolfe was fired from his job at home improvement store Menards on June 3 after social media reports identified him as having participated in the arson attack.

The former security guard was wearing stolen police gear when he was arrested on Wednesday, six days after he allegedly joined rioters in burning down the precinct.

He had been turned in by a fellow employee at Menards when he showed up for work wearing stolen police body armor, a law enforcement duty belt and carrying a police baton.

In others he is on top of concrete barriers brought in to protect the precinct. Again he is shirtless and wearing a hat with a bag strapped across his torso and a police baton raised over his head.

When interviewed he admitted to rolling a wooden barrel into the fire knowing that it would make the fire bigger and help keep it going.

When police caught up with him in his vehicle, several miles from the store, Wolfe was still wearing the body armor to which he had stuck his name written on strip of duct tape. Handcuffs, a knife and an earpiece were also attached to the armor.

A search of his apartment revealed more stolen items belonging to Minneapolis police. They included a riot helmet, 9mm magazine, police radio and police drugs overdose kit.

Wolfe will now be appointed an attorney from the Office of the Federal Defender and is to be held in custody pending a further hearing which is scheduled to take place remotely on Thursday.

In Houston, about 500 guests including stars Jamie Foxx, actor Channing Tatum, NFL star J.J. Watt and Congressman Al Green attended Floyd's funeral service at the Fountain of Praise Church on Tuesday, the culmination of a long farewell to the man whose death has rocked America and fueled calls for police reform.

Following the gathering, Floyd's body will be carried home in a horse-drawn carriage and laid to rest next to his mother at the Houston Memorial Gardens in Pearland.

A pastor at George Floyd's funeral called for the White House to be 'cleaned out' and urged the public to vote as hundreds of mourners, including the families of Ahmaud Arbery, Botham Jean and Eric Garner, gathered to lay the beloved father to rest.

Rev. William 'Bill' Lawson shared powerful remarks at the private service in Floyd's hometown of Houston, demanding that Floyd's death not be a fleeting movement, but a catalyst for real change.

'Is this going to be like so many other movements - a moment of anger and rage and back to business as usual,' he asked.

'You could say that because the prejudiced and the bigoted are not going to change. But we can do some things to change them… Obviously the first thing we have to do is to clean out the White House.'

He continued: 'That has to come closer to us than Washington. Our states and counties and cities have to have good leadership. That means that we have to go and vote,' the pastor emeritus of Wheeler Baptist Church urged.

The service began with gospel music and Reverend Al Sharpton walking down the aisle with Floyd's family's members, all dressed in white to celebrate Floyd's life.

Attendees included Houston Mayor Sylvester Turner, Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee, Attorney Benjamin Crump, Slim Thug, Leela James, Paul Wall, Floyd Mayweather, Congressman Al Green and Bishop James Dixon, according to KHOU11.

Houston Texans football player JJ Watt, chairman and chief executive officer of the Houston Texans Cal McNair, and Cincinnati Bengals star DJ Reader were also seen at the funeral.

In Rev. Sharpton's opening remarks he asked the family members of Ahmaud Arbery, Pamela Turner, Eric Garner, Trayvon Martin, Michael Brown and Botham Jean to stand to uproarious applause from attendees.

'Lives like George will not matter until somebody pays the cost for taking their lives this was not just a tragedy. It was a crime,' Sharpton said in his eulogy.

'If four black cops had done to one white what was done to George ... they would send them to jail,' he added.

In a clear attack on Trump, Sharpton said: 'You’re sitting there thinking about how to stop the protests rather than how to stop the brutality.'

'You’re calling your cabinet in trying to figure out how its going to affect your vote rather than how it’s going to affect our lives. Wickedness in high places.

'You take rubber bullets and tear gas to clear out peaceful protesters and then take the bible and walk in front of a church and use a church as a prop. Wickedness in high places.

'You ain't been walking cross that street when the church didn’t have the boards up. You weren’t putting up no Bible when Arbery was killed in Brunswick, when Taylor was killed in Louisville,' he said.","Security guard, 23, appears in court for burning down Minneapolis police department",1
https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/nov/14/republican-january-6-capitol-attack-rioter,1,"Seeking leniency for a January 6 rioter charged with assaulting police, the Louisiana Republican congressman Clay Higgins – a former law enforcement officer himself – saluted the man’s “good character, faith and core principles”.

In video taken during the attack on Congress on 6 January 2021, the rioter was seen to say: “It’s going to be violent and yes, if you are asking, ‘Is Ryan Nichols going to bring violence? Yes, Ryan Nichols is going to bring violence.’”

Nichols, in an affidavit, admitted posting the video, attacking officers with pepper spray and urging rioters on with shouts including, “This is not a peaceful protest”.

In court in Washington last week, Nichols, of Longview, Texas, pleaded guilty to two charges: obstruction and assaulting, resisting or impeding police and obstruction of an official proceeding.

More than 1,000 arrests have been made over the attack and hundreds of convictions secured, some for seditious conspiracy. Donald Trump, who incited the riot as he attempted to overturn his 2020 presidential election defeat by Joe Biden, faces 17 charges related to his election subversion, four federal and 13 at state level in Georgia.

Nine deaths have been linked to the attack staged by the former president’s supporters, including law enforcement suicides.

Higgins’ own website describes him as having “spent much of his career dedicated to uniformed service [as] an army veteran and law enforcement officer”. It also says he is “widely regarded as one of the most conservative members of Congress”.

Nonetheless, in a letter dated 7 November, he asked the US district judge in Nichols’s case, Royce C Lamberth, to show leniency when passing down sentence.

“Sir,” Higgins wrote. “I submit to you this letter in support of Ryan Taylor Nichols. He is a man of good character, faith, and core principles.

“I humbly ask that he receive fair consideration of the whole of circumstances regarding his case, condition, and background. He has already served nearly two years in the District of Columbia jail in pretrial confinement, which has been destructive to his physical (liver issues) and mental health (PTSD).”

Nichols had been under house arrest since 22 November 2022 and had “not sought to flee nor shown any indication of dangerous activity”, Higgins said.

He added: “Prior to his arrest, Mr Nichols had no criminal background and served honorably in the United States Marine Corps. He continued to serve domestically in a search and rescue capacity, even being publicly recognised for his heroic actions on national television.”

That referred to Nichols’s commendation by the Louisiana-raised TV host Ellen DeGeneres – in 2018 – and in relation to his work to rescue people and animals stranded by Hurricane Florence.

Nichols, Higgins said, “has already paid a tremendous price in time and treasure” for his actions on January 6.

“His case must be considered fairly and thoroughly in line with his fundamental constitutional rights.”

Jennifer 'Jenna' Ryan, 50, of Frisco, turned herself into authorities last week for her role in the January 6 Capitol siege that left five people dead.

She was released from custody hours later and returned home, where she demanded that President Donald Trump pardon her from charges of knowingly entering a restricted building and disorderly conduct.

But the demand went unanswered as Trump left office without adding Ryan to his long list of last minute pardons - so now she's looking to fellow MAGA fans for help.

'I am accepting donations to pay legal fees and losses due to my arrest and charges by the FBI for protesting at the US Capitol. Thank you for your support. Any amount helps,' Ryan tweeted on Thursday along with a link to her PayPal account.

'I have to go to trial in Washington DC for this misdemeanor. I believe I was wrongfully arrested and charged and we have to fight for my freedom and [clear] my name.'

'I am being surrounded by hateful people who are calling me a racist and asking for me to go to prison for 10 or 20 years and saying all sorts of horrible mean things about me. They don't even know me. They want my business destroyed. I need help patriots.'

The plea racked up thousands of replies in a matter of hours - the majority of them from unsympathetic critics who pointed out the irony of Ryan asking for financial assistance after she boasted about her posh private flight to DC.

Ryan, 50, posted her plea for financial support on Twitter on Thursday

The plea racked up thousands of replies in a matter of hours - the majority of them from unsympathetic critics who pointed out the irony of Ryan asking for money after she boasted about her posh private flight to DC

Earlier this week Ryan revealed that she decided to go to DC on a whim after receiving a Facebook message from a handsome stranger looking for people to join him at the rally Trump was holding at the White House. Pictured: Ryan (left) with the new friends she joined on the jet. She did not identify her crush by name but he is presumed to be one of the three men above

But a few people apparently did open their wallets to Ryan, who said she'd already received $1,000 in donations.

She said she originally set up a fundraiser on the Fundly website but 'they shut me down saying I'm a racist'.

She also griped that her computer and MAGA hat were confiscated when FBI agents searched her home over the weekend.

Ryan has fiercely maintained her innocence in the Capitol riots in multiple media interviews this week, including one where she claimed that she only went to DC because a 'very cute guy' invited her.

She said she made the decision on a whim after receiving a Facebook message from a handsome stranger looking for people to join him at the rally Trump was holding at the White House.

'He was adorable,' the single realtor - who said she loves Trump, firmly believes his unfounded claims of voter fraud and has always wanted to attend one of his rallies - told NBC News on Monday. 'So I said: 'Heck yeah, let's go.' I mean, who wouldn't go and get on a private jet?'

But unfortunately for Ryan, the pairing wasn't meant to be.

'There was another adorable girl there, too, and they ended up getting together, darn it,' she said.

Two days after the insurrection Ryan realized she had much bigger problems than the failed romance, as the FBI identified her as a person of interest and shared grabs of a livestream she filmed of herself storming the Capitol.

Ryan didn't identify her crush by name, but he is believed to be one of two men she and another woman were photographed with next to the private jet before their flight to the capital.

Three of the people in the photo have been identified but the two others remain a mystery.

One of the men, seen right next to Ryan, is her friend and fellow realtor Brian Miller. On the other side of Miller is Katie Schwab, another realtor who was reportedly terminated from her job at Century 21 over her involvement in the insurrection.

Ryan is the only member of the group facing charges.

Ryan posted this photo inside the cabin of the plane on Facebook and said the group spent the flight getting to know each other while drinking and bonding over their mutual love for Trump

She turned herself in on Friday morning, but has maintained that she did nothing wrong and has no regrets.

'I have no guilt in my heart,' Ryan told NBC News.

'My intention was not to have a riot. I did not want to have a riot. I was documenting what was going on in the environment I was in.'

'I'm glad I was there, because I witnessed history,' she added later. 'I'll never get the chance to do that again. No one will probably ever be able to go near [the Capitol] again.'

Ryan grew increasingly combative over the course of the interview, especially when asked about the posts she shared on social media during the riots. In one video she was heard saying: 'We're going to go down and storm the Capitol.'

She insisted that her language did not indicate any intent for aggression.

'If you look up the term ""storm"", you can storm in the kitchen. You can storm in and say: 'No more,'' she said.

'I'm not storming in to kill people. What I meant, life or death, is if someone kills me, I will stand for my truth, even if someone kills me.'

She said she feels terrible that five people died as a result of the insurrection, but is adamant that she didn't break the law.

'I, personally, feel innocent in everything that I have done,' she said. 'I feel like I was perfectly within my rights.

'I feel like the police officers were ushering people into the Capitol. There were thousands of people there. I have no guilt.'

The FBI released video of Ryan inside the Capitol prior to her arrest last week

Ryan said accepted the man's invitation to go on his private jet two days beforehand, and asked her friend Brian to come with her as a 'bodyguard'.

She posted a photo inside the cabin of the plane on Facebook and said the group spent the flight getting to know each other while drinking and bonding over their mutual love for Trump.

'We were going in solidarity with President Trump,' Ryan said. 'President Trump requested that we be in DC on the 6th. So this was our way of going and stopping the steal.'

The group arrived on the 5th and spent the night at The Westin Washington before getting up at 6am, donning MAGA gear and joining 'like-minded patriots' gathered at the White House to hear Trump speak.

As the president and his allies riled up the crowd and encouraged them to march to the Capitol, where Congress was convened to certify Joe Biden's election victory, Ryan realized she had a problem: 'There were no port-a-potties.'

'We could not get to a port-a-potty,' she said. 'That was, like, my biggest concern, actually. Because I like to always know I have a bathroom nearby.'

The group then returned to their hotel for a bathroom break and a chance to warm up. They turned on the TV to find Vice President Mike Pence, whom Trump had begged to overturn the election, accepting the results as he presided over the joint session of Congress.

'We were devastated,' Ryan said. 'It was like my dad - somebody I love, somebody I respect - just betrayed someone else I love and I respect, including the country. I couldn't believe it.'

When Ryan's friends decided to head back out to the Capitol, she tagged along because: 'I didn't want to be at the hotel by myself.'

Along the way she shared her since-deleted 21-minute livestream, telling the camera: 'We're gonna go down and storm the capitol. They're down there right now and that's why we came and so that's what we are going to do. So wish me luck.'

Ryan posted a 21-minute livestream on Facebook as she made her way to the Capitol, telling the camera: 'We're gonna go down and storm the Capitol. They're down there right now and that's why we came and so that's what we are going to do. So wish me luck.' The video has since been deleted but is described in an affidavit for her arrest

She went on to post several other videos as she and her friends shoved their way onto the Capitol steps and into the Rotunda.

'We're going to f***ing go in here. Life or death,' she was heard saying, according to federal prosecutors. 'It doesn't matter. Here we go.'

In another clip she was heard calling Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell a 'turtleface' and complaining that she needed a restroom, followed by: 'We are armed and dangerous. This is just the beginning.'

Inside the Capitol she filmed herself saying: 'Y'all know who to hire for your realtor. Jenna Ryan for your realtor.'

She also allegedly posted a photo of a broken window on Twitter, writing: 'Window at The capital. And if the news doesn't stop lying about us we're going to come after their studios next.'

She later tweeted: 'We just stormed the Capital. It was one of the best days of my life.'

Ryan also posted a photo of a broken window on Twitter, writing: 'Window at The capital. And if the news doesn't stop lying about us we're going to come after their studios next'

Ryan lashed out at the media again during her interview with NBC News, where she claimed that she left the Capitol after 'two minutes' because she felt uncomfortable.

'If you want to skewer me in the media and make me out to be a violent person because it fits your storyline, then, you know, that is something that you're going to have to live with in your life,' she said when asked about the rhetoric described in the affidavit for her arrest.

'I know my heart was to go there and let my voice be heard, no matter what. And I stood on the steps of the Capitol, and I did what I came to do. And I did pray.'

Ryan hit out at the FBI agents who raided her home shortly after she returned to Texas and took the MAGA hat she was seen wearing in the Capitol videos.

'The FBI's coming out and raiding my house for a misdemeanor,' she said. 'Taking my MAGA hat. Okay? They took my MAGA hat.'

She also condemned the lawmakers who went ahead to certify Biden's 'fraudulent' victory, saying that she won't vote ever again because she's 'given up on America'.

Ryan said she is hopeful that Trump will pardon her and other protesters charged over the insurrection before he leaves office on Wednesday, but added: 'I'm going to support him no matter what he does.'

She first made her plea for a pardon in an interview with CBS11 over the weekend.

'I would like a pardon from the President of the United States. I think that we all deserve a pardon. I'm facing a prison sentence. I think that I do not deserve that,' she said.

'From what I understand everyone is going to be arrested that was there, so I think everyone deserves a pardon. I would ask the President ask the United States to give me a pardon.'

Ryan argued that she should not be punished for 'following what we were called [by Trump] to do.

'He asked us to fly there, he asked us to be there,' she said of Trump. 'So I was doing what he asked us to do.

'So as far as in my heart of hearts, do I feel like a criminal? No. I am not the villain a lot of people make me out to be or think I am because I'm a Trump supporter.'

Ryan's remarks mirrored an argument from the lawyer for 'QAnon shaman' Jacob Chansley, 33, who stormed the Capitol wearing a fur headdress with horns.

Speaking to CNN last Thursday, Attorney Albert Watkins said Chansley deserves a pardon because his client genuinely felt he was obeying the president's demands in the raid.

'He listened to him. He felt like he was answering the call of our President,' Watkins said.

More than 125 people have been arrested so far on charges related to the violent insurrection led by Trump supporters at the Capitol. Charges range from curfew violations to serious federal felonies related to theft and weapons possession.

In total five people were killed during the siege, including one US Capitol Police officer who was struck in the head with a fire extinguisher.

The FBI and other law enforcement agencies continue to search for the identities of several other individuals who were photographed rioting in the Capitol.

Ryan has said she fears that her involvement in the riots could ruin her real estate career.

The Texas Real Estate Commission has faced numerous complaints demanding that her license be revoked. Ryan responded by issuing a statement saying she was 'truly heartbroken' over the lives lost during the assault.

'Unfortunately, what I believed to be a peaceful political march turned into a violent protest,' she wrote on Twitter.

She also tweeted that she lost a publishing deal for a book related to her work.

'This has taken my company. This has taken my business,' she tweeted.

But with a little time, imagination, and know-how, even the tightest of budgets can be stretched to turn your garden into a luxurious outdoor space to rival any Chelsea Flower Show garden.

From sticking to a particular colour scheme to knowing where to find the biggest bargains and growing a certain type of ‘posh’ vegetable, here are 16 tips and tricks to help you achieve the glamorous garden of your dreams without spending the earth.

WHITE AND GREEN ARE KEY

Queen Anne's Lace embodies the perfect white and green colour palette

A simple but effective trick to make your garden look high-end is to stick to a white and green colour palette. Ferns and white hydrangeas are a classic combination for a lush and shady town garden. You can achieve this look on a budget by growing your own plants from seed. Now is the perfect time to sow biennial white foxglove seeds to grow under cover over winter and plant out in the spring, alongside annual Queen Anne’s Lace or Ammi majus which you can also plant as seeds now. Buy 250 seeds of white-flowered foxglove for £2.99 from waitrosegarden.com.

GROW POSH VEG FROM SEED

Grow globe artichokes over winter to plant out in a raised vegetable bed or flower border the following spring

Globe artichokes are both architectural and edible and can add a touch of luxury to your outdoor space. Also known as cardoons, they grow up to 6ft high and have large silvery leaves and thistle-like flowers which can be eaten as buds. These upmarket vegetables can be costly if you buy them as large plants. A more affordable approach is to grow them from seed. Sow under cover from March to July into moist compost and grow them over winter to plant out in a raised vegetable bed or flower border the following spring. Buy a packet of approximately 40 seeds for £2.35 from chilternseeds.co.uk.

BAG BARGAIN FURNITURE

Now is a good time to buy outdoor furniture in end-of-summer sales

The end of summer is a great time to go bargain hunting for outdoor furniture as many garden centres and online retailers slash their prices by up to 80 per cent. John Lewis, Habitat, Dunelm and Oka are all currently holding sales.

If you’re willing to go second-hand (and you should be), scouring local online groups can bring up beautiful, hand-crafted furniture that would have cost hundreds or even thousands when bought brand new. Facebook Marketplace and Gumtree are good places to start. Go for durable materials such as teak and cast aluminium and choose classic designs.

PLANT ROSES BAREROOT

Roses are considered the queen of plants and add a sense of luxury to any garden

No luxurious high-end garden would be complete without roses, often thought of as the queen of plants. Many of them are now enjoying a second bloom after taking a rest over the summer. It can be tempting to buy roses while they are in flower, but any canny gardener knows it’s better to plant them bareroot between November and March. They may look like straggly sticks during this season but, as well as being more affordable, it is also the best time to get them in the ground as they have time to put down roots before the spring.

UPCYCLE WOODWORK

Consider giving your shed a lick of paint in grey or sage green

Give sheds, benches and tables a fresh, boutique hotel look by painting them in tasteful shades such as sage green and smoke grey. Wait for a dry, sunny day, put on some old clothes, and get painting. Ditch expensive posh paints such as Farrow and Ball and go for Valspar Garden Paint in Dried Basil or Shadowed Ivy which is a fraction of the cost (£27 for 2.5l of Valspar Garden Paint from B&Q).

BUY COTSWOLD GRAVEL IN BULK

Gravel makes a cheap but chic landscaping surface for paths in your garden

Gravel is a great option for a cheap but chic hard landscaping surface - especially sandy-coloured Cotswold chippings found in posh estates and hotels across the country. It is much more cost-effective to buy it in bulk from an aggregates supplier than to order smaller bags. This only makes sense if you have a large area to cover (0.12p per kilo when buying an 850kg bulk bag of Cotswold chippings from gravelmaster.co.uk).

GROW YOUR OWN SALVIAS

Grow salvias in pots for a pop of colour in your garden

Salvias are a mainstay of designer gardens, and it is easy to propagate them from existing plants for free – either from your own plant or one belonging to a friendly neighbour. This is best done first thing in the morning when the plant is well-hydrated. Go out with a clear plastic bag and a pair of secateurs and cut off non-flowering shoots. When you have gathered your cuttings, cut them just below a leaf node and remove the lower leaves with a knife. Then insert into a pot filled with a mixture of compost and sand or grit. Keep your cuttings moist in a bright sheltered place out of direct sunlight. In a few weeks, they will have put on roots and can be moved to a bigger pot of their own. By next spring they will be ready to plant out in the garden (a salvia in a 9cm pot costs £6.79 from crocus.co.uk).

ASK FOR BUILDERS’ JUNK

Old chimney pots make attractive planters

You can spend a small fortune on large planters, but if you ask a friendly local builder, they will often have old butler sinks or other items destined for a skip which they are happy to hand over for cash or, if you are lucky, for free. Plant up an old chimney pot with violas and trailing ivy or fill a discarded metal water tank with bamboo.

GO FOR POTS IN ONE MATERIAL

Gardens photographed in magazines often use just one material when it comes to pots and planters. Fired clay suits a classic country garden, while galvanised zinc or steel works well in a contemporary town garden. Once you’ve decided what looks good in your outdoor space, search for second-hand pots in the same material for stylish consistency (set of three aged terracotta pots £20.99 from Amazon).

DISPLAY SHEDS

There is no getting away from the fact that sheds and garden buildings are a considerable investment. One way to reduce the cost is to buy ex-display models that have been on show at a garden centre. Any wear and tear is likely to be superficial and can easily be remedied with a lick of paint. If you can transport and assemble them yourself there are even more savings to be made. Skinner Sheds currently have an ex-display cash and carry double potting shed for sale for £689, down from £1,888 (skinners-sheds.com).

HANG FAIRY LIGHTS FOR INSTANT GLAMOUR

Fairy lights are a simple, quick addition but can ramp up the glamour in your garden

You don’t have to spend a fortune to light up your garden at night. In fact, simple lighting solutions can often look the most glamorous. Drape fairy lights from fences, trees or washing line posts. If you don’t have access to outdoor electricity, there are affordable solar-powered festoon lights on the market (4liteuk.com sells Antheia solar festoon lights at £29.99 for 3m).

PAINT IT BLACK

Old mirrors hung on outside walls create a designer room outside

Black walls are all the rage when it comes to interiors, so why not try it on your exterior walls as well? Paint fences and walls with a warm black exterior paint and hang an old mirror or decorative plates to create a designer room outside (try Valspar Garden Paint in Victorian Dusk or Downing Street, £27 for 2.5L from B&Q).

GO WILD FOR WILDFLOWERS

Try making a mini meadow on your lawn to provide a riot of colour

No chic retreat is complete without a wildflower meadow. It doesn’t matter if you don’t have much space or money, a packet of seeds doesn’t cost much, and you can make a mini meadow in a large container or turn over a metre or two of your lawn. Differential mowing (leaving a patch of long grass while cutting around or through it) is particularly effective. The RHS has a range of shake and sow wildflower seeds for just £6.99 a box (rhsplants.co.uk).

TAKE ON END OF SEASON PLANTS

If you’re in a garden centre or nursery this autumn, look out for perennials that are dying back. They make not look very attractive now, but chances are the price label will be reduced by 50 per cent or more from when they were at their best earlier in the summer. A little patience will pay off. Get them in the ground now, making sure to mark where you put them, and next spring you will have a glorious flowering plant for less.

PARASOL CHIC

Parasols with tassels also create a high-end look

Handmade bamboo and silk parasols with tassels are the latest must-have garden accessory. If you don’t want to pay the high price tag, why not repurpose an old beach umbrella? Opt for classic stripes or cover a plain shade with paisley prints from charity shops. Mismatched panels are double the chic factor. Daals have a lovely selection of striped parasols for £89.99 (daals.com)

SMALL PLANTS ARE KEY

Using smaller plants in pots can also add the wow factor

For that luxurious garden feel, you want an abundance of plants, but if you are buying them all it can prove pricey. Smaller plants in 9cm pots are much cheaper than plants in bigger 1l and 2l containers. They might not have the instant wow factor but planting them at this size can lead to healthier plants as they have more time to establish in the soil while they are growing. They will soon bulk out and before you know it, your borders will be brimming.",The 16 ways to make your garden look posh on a budget revealed by a top expert - from the classiest colour scheme to the shade you should paint your shed,1

José Adolfo Macías, known more widely as 'Fito', is the leader of the feared Los Choneros - which until recent years was safely Ecuador's largest and most feared gang, linked to extortion, murder and drug trafficking.

Despite being in prison since 2011 (aside from a brief three month spell in 2013 after he also escaped), the 44-year-old took over the leadership of the cartel in 2020, and has since coordinated its activities from inside his 'private bunker' cell.

That was until Sunday when he was found to have escaped. His disappearance prompted President Daniel Noboa to declare a state of emergency and nightly curfew on Monday as authorities launched a manhunt for the feared criminal.

Ecuadorian gangsters unleashed a wave of retaliatory violence across the country - storming a TV station, executing police and prison guards, and threatening to execute civilians on the spot if they are found on the streets at night.

In a further escalation, Noboa ordered military operations to 'neutralize' criminal gangs, as the country exploded into what he called an 'internal armed conflict.'

Long a peaceful haven sandwiched between top cocaine exporters Colombia and Peru, Ecuador has seen violence explode in recent years as rival gangs with links to Mexican and Colombian cartels vie for control.

Ecuadorian authorities attribute the unprecedented violence to a power vacuum triggered by the killing in December 2020 of Jorge Zambrano, alias 'Rasquiña' or 'JL,' the previous leader of the Los Choneros cartel before Fito.

Ever since, Los Choneros - now led by Fito - and splinter groups Los Lobos and Los Tiguerones have been fighting over territory and control, including within prison facilities, where at least 400 inmates have died since 2021 in riots.

The gangs have links to cartels from Colombia and Mexico, including the infamous Sinaloa and Jalisco New Generation cartels, who are also at war.

Los Choneros was formed in 2005 in the city of Manta, when it had just eight members aged between 18 and 30 years old.

Its founder and first leader was a man named Jorge Bismark Véliz España, known as Chonero or Teniente España, said to have started out as a drug dealer.

Bismark first worked for another gang - Los Queseros - headed up by Carlos Jesús Cedeño Vera, known alternatively as El Rojo or El Quesero.

However, the two became enemies, with El Rojo ordering Bismark's murder.

While he failed to kill Bismark himself, the hit attempt did injure both the gangster and his daughter, and also killed his wife.

In retaliation, Bismark gathered members of his family, friends and criminal associates - collectively known as Los Choneros - and killed Vera's brother and son.

The attack and the retaliation resulted in a war breaking out between the two sides and the eventual destruction of Los Queseros, with Los Choneros still standing.

However, while his gang survived, Bismark did not.

In 2007, he was gunned down near Quito by assassins, and he was replaced by Jorge Luis Zambrano - once a hitman during the group's early days.

In the years that followed Zambrano's takeover, Los Choneros rose to the top of organised crime in Ecuador, helped by the gang's alliance with Ecuador's biggest drug trafficker, Washington Prado Alava, alias 'Gerald.'

But the successful partnership was also facilitated by a money laundering expert: Fito, who managed the group's criminal activities from his prison cell.

During that time, Los Choneros became an armed group working with Gerald, and began to play a significant role in the trafficking of cocaine through Manabí, sending the drug to the United States, Mexico and Europe.

But Fito had even larger ambitions. The partnership came to an end when the money launderer hatched a plan to bring Gerald down, which he did so by framing him and having him extradited to the US for drug trafficking.

This allowed Los Choneros to move in to fill the void in the trafficking game.

It was not all plain sailing for the powerful cartel leader, however. Both Zambrano and Fito have been behind bars since 2011, arrested in the same year, with Fito being sentenced to 34 years in prison.

But this did not prevent Zambrano and Fito from continuing their operations.

Fito even escaped before, in 2013, when he was able to flee prison and cross a river on a boat. It took authorities three months to track him down and lock him up again.

According to the Ecuadorian newspaper Primicias, Fito converted his prison cell in Guayaquil Regional Prison into a 'private bunker.

From there, he is said to have controlled Los Choneros' criminal operations, including extortion and murder, according to the publication.

He also graduated as a lawyer and even obtained a diploma in criminal law.

According to Primicias, in May 2023, the crime boss had more than 23 million dollars to his name, amassed through his criminal enterprises and shell companies.

In his years in prison, Fito himself has undergone a transformation - much like his cartel. He was once unassuming, with short hair and stubble, but now he looks more imposing, with longer hair and a black bushy beard, greying in places

According to the Ecuadorian newspaper Primicias, Fito converted his prison cell in Guayaquil Regional Prison (pictured) into a 'private bunker

According to figures from Ecuador's Anti-Narcotics Investigation Directorate, illicit activities in Guayaquil Regional Prison raise 70 dollars per week, per cell.

Rare glimpses into Fito's prison cell show large murals adorning the walls, with posing in front a huge picture of a horse and golden bejewelled horseshoe.

In another mural, a depiction of Fito himself appears to be painted on the wall, flanked by a pair of AK-47s and a revolver.

Perhaps the biggest challenge faced by Fito and Los Choneros in recent years came in 2020, when Zambrano was assassinated. This led to a violent power struggle, and saw splinter groups emerge from factions within the cartel.

Many of these are now at war with each other, fighting for control.

This came to a head in February 2021 when several sub-groups - including Los Tiguerones - joined to attack the original gang in three Ecuadorian jails.

From 2021 to 2022, more than 400 inmates were killed in Ecuadorian prisons, and often in gory massacres involving machetes, automatic weapons and grenades.

With significantly more enemies than he did before he assumed the leadership of the cartel, Fito has continued to operate from the safety of his cell.

He even hit the headlines in October 2021 when his glamorous girlfriend was caught after she spent a week sleeping in Fito's jail cell - and was busted as she tried to leave the prison in the middle of a riot while wearing a guard's uniform.

Reports at the time said Verónica Briones Zambrano arrived at the Guayaquil Regional Jail on September 27 and remained there with him for the week.

Verónica Briones Zambrano, the girlfriend of Fito, is escorted from the Guayaquil Regional Jail in Guayaquil, Ecuador, in 2021 after security forces were called to the prison and were met by gun fire from the inmates. She was found to have been staying in his room

Briones Zambrano was looking to leave the penitentiary on October 2 that year in the midst of a rebellion as security forces were greeted with gunfire.

She identified herself as Fito's girlfriend and admitted that she had been staying at the jail for several days.

Ecuadorian network Ecuavisa reported that Zambrano was removed from the prison and transferred to the Guayas prosecutor's headquarters.

However, the police officer who was in custody of the woman received a phone call from the National Police's 8 District chief Fausto Buenaño, who instructed him to release Zambrano because Fito had come to an agreement to hand over the gang's arsenal of weapons in exchange for her freedom.

Other reports suggested Zambrano was released from custody after she appeared before a prosecutor and alleged that she had been actually held against her will at the prison and originally kept quiet because she feared for her life.

It is unclear whether Briones Zambrano is related to Los Choneros's former leader and Fito's assassinated cartel partner Luis Zambrano.

According to reports in Ecuador, Luis Zambrano did have a wife and daughter.

Online, Briones describes herself as a former odontology student. She has also been referred to as a 'model'. It is not clear if she was prosecuted for her time in prison with Fito, or what state their relationship is in now.

Following his latest escape, accounts differ in Ecuador about how Fito pulled it off.

According to one report from Ecuadorian news outlet Diario Aldia, Fito briefly left prison for a medical check up on Christmas Day.

However, the report suggests that he never returned, and that it was rather a body double who was checked back into the Guayaquil Regional Prison. Former Minister of the Interior, José Serrano, has since said that 'Fito left through the front door.'

According to another account, reported in neighbouring Peru's RPP news outlet, Fito was due to be transferred to another facility.

But when police went to check on him on Sunday, he was nowhere to be found.

Since his escape, the focus has moved away from Fito and on to the chaos that was prompted by it. But the question remains: where is he now?

https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/feb/08/turkey-and-syria-earthquake-what-we-know-so-far-on-day-three,1,"The death toll in Syria has risen to 2,662 , according to reports from AFP. Syria’s government has received help from a host of Arab countries including Egypt and Iraq, as well as from its key ally Russia, which has sent rescue teams and deployed forces already in Syria to join relief work, including in Aleppo.

Turkey’s president Recep Tayyip Erdoğan announced that the death toll from Monday’s quake had reached 8,754 in Turkey. Visiting Kahramanmaraş , which was near the epicentre of the quake, he said “On the first day we experienced some issues, but then on the second day and today the situation is under control”. Erdoğan promised the government aims to build housing within one year for those left without a home in the 10 provinces affected.

The combined death toll from Monday’s earthquake which struck Syria and Turkey has now reached 11,416, as rescue efforts continued across the region, despite being hampered by cold weather conditions.

A first 7.8-magnitude quake struck at 4.17 am (1.17 GMT) on Monday near the Turkish city of Gaziantep , home to about 2 million people. It was followed by a 7.5-magnitude tremor and several aftershocks.

A container blaze at Turkey’s southern port of Iskenderun has been brought under control, Turkey’s maritime authority said on Wednesday, following combined extinguishing efforts from land, sea and air. The blaze started when containers were toppled during the quake.

Cold weather continues to be expected in the region with minimum and maximum temperatures for Kahramanmaraş today of -6C and 1C (21-34F), and for Gaziantep between -5C and 1C (23-34F). Diyarbakır is expected to have continued snowfall, with temperatures climbing to 2C (35F) at most.

Syria has activated the EU civil protection mechanism , two days after the earthquake, to request further assistance from the 27-country bloc and the eight other nation states that are part of the programme. The European Union has has already mobilised search and rescue teams to help Turkey, while the bloc’s Copernicus satellite system has been activated to provide emergency mapping services. At least 19 member countries have offered assistance.

Four Australians are unaccounted for . Australia’s foreign affairs department is providing consular assistance to the families of the nationals who were where the catastrophe struck and to about 40 other Australians and their families who were also in the area.

Three British nationals were missing since the earthquake, the UK’s foreign secretary said on Tuesday. “We assess that the likelihood of large-scale British casualties remains low,” James Cleverly said.

Pope Francis offered his prayers Wednesday for the thousands of victims of the earthquake in Syria and Turkey and called on the international community to continue to support rescue and recovery efforts.

At least 20 people have escaped from a jail holding members of Islamic State in north-west Syria, according to local media and Agence France-Presse. The military police prison in the town of Rajo, near the Turkish border, was damaged in the quakes and aftershocks, a source at the facility said, leading to a riot and escapes.

Syria was accused of playing politics with aid after the Syrian ambassador to the UN, Bassam Sabbagh, said his country should be responsible for the delivery of all aid into Syria, including those areas not under government control. The dispute over the control of the aid is hampering efforts into northern Syria, which is held by rebel groups. The government in Damascus allows aid to enter the region through only one border crossing.

Aid from Turkey to north-west Syria has temporarily stopped due to the fallout of the devastating earthquake, according to a UN spokesperson on Tuesday, leaving aid workers grappling with the problem of how to help people in a country fractured by war.",Turkey and Syria earthquake: what we know so far on day three,1
https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jan/04/i-feel-abandoned-australians-waiting-hours-to-be-tested-and-days-for-their-results-blame-governments,1,"When Sydney man Scott Sumner woke up in a “full sweat” at midnight on Monday with aches and cold symptoms he thought to himself: “This is not a good sign.”

It was more bad news when the Petersham resident arrived at the Summer Hill testing clinic about 8.15am on Tuesday to find a queue of cars he guessed was 3km long.

Still, he joined it, and inched forward, passing the time with Netflix and hoping he might be home in time for lunch. But at 10.53am, when he was about 100 metres from the clinic, his hopes were dashed.

“They just started calling people through and saying, ‘Nope, we’re done for the day’. I was like, ‘What do you mean you’re done for the day?’” The clinic was closing at midday and they had to end the line somewhere. Sumner didn’t make the cut.

By the time he spoke to Guardian Australia he was in a walk-in line at the Royal Prince Alfred hospital in Camperdown for his third attempt at being tested.

“It’s pretty bad, it’s pretty frustrating,” Sumner said. His head was throbbing in the hot weather and – because he’d initially expected to stay in his car – he had not brought sunscreen. He got home six hours after he left, sick, sunburnt but, finally, tested.

“I feel kind of abandoned,” he said. Throughout the pandemic, he said, “I’ve been trying to do the right thing constantly … I’m now trying to do the right thing again and it’s like, I guess I’ll just get messed around by the government all day. You feel like you’ve done so much to sacrifice already. We’ve done lockdowns, we’ve done all those things, and now it feels like they’re actively not wanting us to get tested.”

I left my house at 8am, got turned away from two drive-thru #covid clinics, ended up standing in line for two hours at RPA and have just gotten home at 2:20pm. What a life. Fatigue, headaches, fever and my entire body is aching. — Scott Sumner (@fakescottsumner) January 4, 2022

It’s 10:53am and I just got turned away from a #Covid testing clinic in Summer Hill as they are closing. I’ve been in line since 8:15am and was about 100m from the entrance…wow. — Scott Sumner (@fakescottsumner) January 3, 2022

In December, the prime minister, Scott Morrison, said: “We have to move from a culture of mandates to a culture of responsibility. That’s how we live with this virus into the future.”

But many Australians doing their best to take personal responsibility feel they are being thwarted at every turn. Across the Christmas and New Year period, social media lit up with fury and frustration over lost hours and days as people tried and often failed to do the right thing.

Australians are waiting hours to get tested, waiting days for results, and waiting who knows how long for rapid antigen tests to appear at their local store. If they can afford them, that is.

The most cursory Google reveals these Innoscreen tests are meant to come in a box of 20 and can cost as little as between $12.25 and $13.75 per test in Australia.

Instagram account @bondi_lines, which previously posted wait times for popular nightlife spots in the beachside suburb, has started posting testing clinic wait times, as well as advice on where people can find rapid antigen tests.

Tempers are fraying. When a driver tried to cut the line at Summer Hill on Tuesday morning, two “large men” descended on the car, Sumner said. “[They] were banging on the window and saying, ‘You can’t do this’. We had all been in line for hours at that point … everyone’s frustrations were so high.”

Tatiana Paipetis joined the queue at Mascot drive-through, also run by Laverty Pathology, about 7.30am on Tuesday. “I’ve said about five times I wish I had brought a book,” she told Guardian Australia in a phone interview from her car about 11am.

Her voice was muffled by the mask she wore to protect against possible infection from her teenage son, who was lying in the back seat, too ill to sit up.

He had tested negative twice before Christmas and both times received exposure alerts from the walk-in 4Cyte clinic. Now he was sick again after being exposed to the virus on New Year’s Eve and Paipetis thought she better take him to the drive-through. “I’m just trying to protect him and others, because I’m pretty sure he’s got Covid,” she said.

After they had been queuing for about an hour, Paipetis watched a woman get out of the passenger seat in the car in front of her and walk away. She returned half an hour later – with McDonald’s. “I was like, ‘Oh my god, this woman went to Macca’s,” Paipetis said. “And she’s probably got Covid because she’s the passenger being driven to the testing.”

Despite waiting nearly four-and-a-half hours to get tested, Paipetis and her son were among the lucky ones. She was within 20 cars of the cut-off point, where those lining up were told to go elsewhere. “They’re going to have a riot on their hands in a minute because they’re telling people they can’t be tested and they’ve been here for hours,” she said.

Paipetis said she could afford to take the morning off work, to use up petrol by running the air conditioner for four hours. But what about people who can’t? “It really is about equity and access that concerns me most,” she said. “This government is clearly looking after private interests and the top end of town, and it’s really not the way we should be operating as a society.”

The Omicron surge came just as private pathology providers closed testing clinics or substantially reduced hours for the festive season. Other closures were simply to cope with the immense backlog of tests. On Monday, Australian Clinical Labs shut a number of sites, stating it was necessary “due to the significant increase in testing volumes across the state”. On Tuesday, of the pathology clinic’s 31 testing sites, 19 were closed and the remaining 12 open during the morning.

All Histopath centres, bar the airport, were either running on reduced hours or closed altogether until 9 January, while several 4Cyte clinics were closed, some until 5 January and others until 10 January. All but a couple of Laverty sites closed at midday on Tuesday, while Medlab Pathology clinics were mostly completely shuttered, one open until 1pm.

“There’s obviously reasons everything slowed down,” Paipetis said. “But it’s not like we couldn’t logistically plan for this.”

And the wait doesn’t end when people finally get swabbed. Balmain man Dean Morelli received a positive test result 126 hours after he was tested – a period of more than five days.

“By the time [NSW Health] got that information and it was published as a daily statistic, I’d substantially recovered from Covid,” he said.

“The state government is hostage to the quality of the data being presented. If the data is inaccurate, it begs the question, what’s the quality of the decision-making process?

“In fairness, I fully appreciate the fact they were totally inundated. But someone’s got to take responsibility somewhere for this situation.”",‘I feel abandoned’: Australians waiting hours to be tested and days for their results blame governments,1

They were wearing a grey hoodie, black pants, gloves and an N-95 mask. While around 100 people have been arrested for their role in the riot and many have been charged, police are still no closer to closing in on the bomber.

The FBI is currently offering a $50,000 reward to anyone with information about the bomber's identity.

The bombs that were found were both active, officials have said. They were diffused and are still being studied.

The rehearsal was called off and everyone taking part was rushed inside to shelter in place until the coast was clear.

Alice Aguiar, nine, Bebe King, six, and Elsie Stancombe, seven, were killed at the class when a hooded knifeman burst in and began stabbing the children in attendance.

A 17-year-old boy, who cannot be named for legal reasons, remains in police custody after being arrested on suspicion of murder and attempted murder as officers secured extra time to question him.

Police say they are not looking for anyone else and the incident is not being treated as terrorism.

Five other children remain in a critical condition in hospital alongside two adults - one of whom is thought to be Ms Lucas.

She and fellow teacher Heidi Barlow who were leading the class, which also involved yoga and friendship bracelet making, courageously tried to save as many of the children in their care as they could.

Ms Barlow, 35, is said to have locked herself in a toilet with several children, saving their lives.

Ms Lucas' family were told by first responders at the scene how she pushed two people into a stoarge room, then 'bent over two little girls' and used her body as a shield to protect them.

'She put her arms up, all her arms are cut,' Mr Rimmer said.

He added Ms Lucas's bravery was all the more extraordinary due to her small stature: 'She's tiny and she's as thin as a rake.'

Mr Rimmer said his cousin is 'just worried about everyone else' and that she 'always thinks about everyone else before herself.'

He told the paper online rumours Ms Lucas had died made the excruciating wait for news all the harder.

'She was really really lovely. I only knew her from high school. Quite quiet, she was primary school teacher, she wanted to help people.

'That's why you get into it, to do everything you can and that's what she's done.'

Up to 300 people are believed to have been involved, with cars and bins set alight, missiles thrown at police and a mosque attacked.

Police officers believe most of those involved were not from Stockport and were supporters of the English Defense League.

An update issued this afternoon revealed 54 officers were injured with 27 taken to hospital.

Speaking this afternoon, Serena Kennedy, chief constable of Merseyside Police, said there 'were about 70 people who made their way away from the vigil and were making their way towards the mosque.

'They suddenly became about 200 in number and then others joined that number.'

A 32-year-old man was also arrested on suspicion of affray and possession of a bladed article.

A spokesperson said: 'The offenders destroyed garden walls to use the bricks as missiles to attack officers and set cars belonging to the public on fire at random.

https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/mar/30/donald-trump-uses-new-website-rewrite-history-presidency,1,"Donald Trump has launched a new website celebrating his time as US president that includes a very selective retelling of the history of his time in office.

45office.com is billed as a platform for his supporters to stay in touch and a place where Trump will continue his “America first” campaign.

The centrepiece of the site is an 885-word history of the Trump presidency, listing the achievements of what it describes as “the most extraordinary political movement in history”.

In a hyperbolic opening paragraph, it says he dethroned political dynasties, defeated “the Washington establishment” and “overcame virtually every entrenched power structure”.

The history does, however, omit several significant moments from Trump’s presidency.

On the economy, the site says: “President Trump ushered in a period of unprecedented economic growth, job creation, soaring wages, and booming incomes.” Trump frequently described his administration as building “the greatest economy in the history of our country”, a claim repeatedly debunked. It also fails to note that during the pandemic last year the US economy suffered one of its worst financial crashes.

The US recorded the world’s largest coronavirus death toll on Trump’s watch, but the website describes his handling of the pandemic as a success, saying: “When the coronavirus plague arrived from China, afflicting every nation around the globe, President Trump acted early and decisively.” It neglects to mention that Trump had in fact described coronavirus as a problem that’s “going to go away” five times in March 2020, even as case numbers rose.

Also absent is that Trump became the first US president in history to twice face impeachment trials in Congress. And that he was the first US president in over one hundred years to lose the popular vote twice. Hillary Clinton secured 2.8m more votes than Trump in 2016, and Joe Biden’s 2020 margin of victory was even larger, at 7m votes.

Nor does it mention that he became the first major world leader to be banned from social media platforms such as Facebook and Twitter while in office after they deemed he had used their sites to cite an insurrection. The Capitol riot, which led to the loss of five lives, also does not warrant a mention.

The website’s homepage boasts that “the office of Donald J Trump is committed to preserving the magnificent legacy of the Trump administration, while at the same time advancing the America first agenda”.

It also promises that “through civic engagement and public activism, the office of Donald J Trump will strive to inform, educate, and inspire Americans from all walks of life as we seek to build a truly great American future”.

Trump retains significant influence over the Republican party despite his loss in the 2020 election and has hinted at a possible presidential run in 2024. He has also started actively backing Republican candidates who may be able to unseat fellow party members Trump feels were disloyal to him by failing to back his baseless claims of election fraud last year.

In an interview with Fox News this month, Jason Miller, a former Trump campaign spokesperson, said that following his bans from Twitter and Facebook, Trump would launch his own social media platform in the next few months.",Donald Trump uses new website to rewrite history of his presidency,1
https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/sep/16/despicable-sydney-police-stop-muslim-mourners-from-watching-funerals-from-cars,1,"In Islam, it is essential that the dead are buried as soon as possible. The body is washed, prayed over, taken to the cemetery and buried, with some small prayer or invocation said by the grave.

It is usually a quick process, sometimes drawn out by lingering family, but one that can be shortened in times of difficulty, such as in a pandemic.

The family physically bury the body, read the invocations and line up to share condolences.

But with a large percentage of the Sydney Muslim community living in the 12 local government areas of concern, and under the toughest restrictions, the community has had to adapt.

Under lockdown rules, only 10 people can attend a funeral.

So when three families had to bury their dead at Rookwood cemetery on Wednesday, some turned up in cars, allowing them to watch without being present outside.

Police arrived soon after the families had parked up, preventing them from burying the dead until all the cars left. NSW police said there were a “large number of attendees” and that they were “in breach of the current public health orders.“

According to mourners who spoke to Guardian Australia under the condition of anonymity, up to 10 police vehicles turned up, knocking on car windows and instructing them to leave.

Tensions escalated, with attendees saying they were frustrated at their inability to even watch their loved ones being buried, let alone fulfil the traditions they hold dear.

Four men were arrested as the families pleaded with police to allow them to watch the burials.

Kieran O’Halloran, a family friend who turned up to pay his respects, said he was shocked at the behaviour of the police.

“The way they acted was despicable. They showed no sensitivity to the fact it was a funeral and had no reverence for the cemetery.

“No one was talking out of line, and then the police just marched on them. They surged forward, getting right in your face. Of course they’re gonna get a reaction from some people.”

O’Halloran described what he witnessed as “traumatic” and called the police response “disproportionate”.

“If I was burying my father today, that would leave such a sour taste. I was absolutely disgusted. They really, really should offer those families an apology for what happened.”

NSW police allege that one of the men had become “aggressive” and “threatened an officer”. He has been charged with intimidation of police, use of offensive language in public and a failure to comply with public health orders.

“Officers attached to Auburn, Burwood, Bankstown and Campsie Police Area Commands attended along with the Public Order and Riot Squad (PORS),” the force said.

“The group of between 80 and 100 people dispersed when directed by police; however, four men failed to comply and remained in the area.”

Three of the four men were issued fines, while the fourth was refused bail and will appear at Burwood local court on Thursday.

Another mourner said the way police had handled the situation left his family in pain.

“Suffering, anger and pain,” he said. “This is how we feel right now. We should be allowed to grieve, we’re grieving with our family.

“There were three funerals today and the police destroyed their loved ones’ hearts. It’s unfair. It’s a time for empathy and they showed no empathy whatsoever.

“It’s unbelievable, it’s heartbreaking to see what we’re going through as a country.”

The mourner, who did not want to be named, said everyone had worn masks and practised social distancing. He said he had stayed up to five meters away from any other person.

He also said that it had been particularly difficult considering that his family had not seen the deceased in months, because of the lockdown.

“None of us have seen our him for months. And now that he’s left us, and because of this situation, we don’t have a chance to farewell him.

“But then we see pictures of people on Bondi beach or in the east, and the police walking around, and they said nothing. But when it comes to the western suburbs, they target us.”

The sense of anger was palpable, according to another mourner, who said people had asked police why they were breaking up a funeral and “not in Bondi”.

Another, the son of one of the deceased, posted a tribute to his father on Facebook, saying that burying him was “the hardest thing” he’s ever done.

“My father, this man, was the real eye of the tiger, and the foundation of our family. A real old school gentleman. A man who would never break his word, but humble at the same time.

“Even though it feels so surreal, I know this is your time, your time is up on this Earth and you are in a better place now.”",‘Despicable’: Sydney police stop Muslim mourners from watching funerals from cars,1

Campaigners Dora Moutot, 36, and 33-year-old Marguerite Stern faced chants of 'A terf, a bullet, social justice', while they have also been criticised by politicians for their alleged 'transphobic' views.

Yet there has been public support from Harry Potter author Rowling who is outspoken on gender issues, defending women against TRAs - trans rights activists - who call opponents 'terfs', or trans-exclusionary radical feminists.

The French pair have come under scrutiny after publishing their bestselling book Transmania, which is critical of trans-affirmative activists they say are 'infiltrating every sphere of society' with their 'ideology'.

Demonstrators in Strasbourg last week chanted that Ms Moutot and Ms Stern should go to 'the bottom of the Rhine' - prompting Rowling to speak up in their defence.

French feminist Dora Moutot, pictured in Paris in October 2021, has been criticised by French politicians for the new gender-critical book Transmania she has co-written

Ms Moutot (pictured, right) shared on X, formerly Twitter, how she faced chants of 'A terf, a bullet, social justice' from protesters in Strasbourg

The author posted on X, formerly Twitter, to her 14.1million followers: 'As someone whose death has been demanded on placards for exactly the same reason (knowing ""woman"" isn’t a feeling in a man’s head), I send @‌doramoutot love and solidarity.'

Ms Moutot and Ms Stern say it has become 'impossible' to make statements such as 'women are Homo sapiens females and men are Homo sapiens males' without being censored or being attacked.

The bullet chants came last Monday when the duo arrived for a talk on their book at Pantheon-Assas University in the French capital Paris and needed protection by 15 vans of riot police.

Ms Moutot has now told the Telegraph: 'I can't stay at home - they have my address and I have received death threats, so I've moved out temporarily.'

Bills have been proposed by senators from the right-wing parties Les Republicans and Rassemblement National calling for a ban on all medical treatment such as puberty blockers for minors suffering from gender dysphoria.

French president Emmanuel Macron's women’s rights minister Aurore Bergé has said she will not back the proposed legislation.

Ms Moutot and Ms Stern say the French government should be doing more to protect women in defiance of pro-trans campaigners.

Ms Moutot told the Telegraph: 'It’s as if France were in a bubble, completely closing its ears to what’s going on internationally, and the mistakes made in the UK, the countries of Northern Europe.

'France is always behind the curve on Britain on such issues. When I’ve spoken to English people, they’ve told me, 'In France, you’re not going to fall for that.' Well, in fact, it’s even worse here because we should know better.'

Harry Potter author JK Rowling has posted online in support of Dora Moutot after the French author and campaigner told of being threatened because of her views on gender

JK Rowling has been an outspoken critic of gender self-identification

Trans rights activists held a separate demonstration in support of transgender people in Paris last Sunday - launched by 800 organisations and public figure opposing proposed new laws

She told of how the French capital's Socialist-run town hall had put pressure on billboard firm JCDecaux to remove posters promoting their book Transmania.

The city's deputy mayor Emmanuel Grégoire has said: 'Sexual orientation and gender identity are not an ideology.

'The dissemination and promotion of such discourse runs counter to the values espoused by the city of Paris.'

Ms Moutot says their book is 'not transphobic', adding: 'In no way does it advocate hatred of others or of trans people.'

Meanwhile, the authors have cited the Cass Review of gender services for children, published last month, which said many teenagers in the UK were being allowed to change their gender based on 'remarkably weak evidence'.

Report author Dr Hilary Cass, a leading paediatrician, warned there was a 'lack of high-quality research' on the effects of giving children puberty blockers and hormones, while saying the toxicity in the trans debate had become 'exceptional'.

The review prompted NHS England, which had already stopped puberty blockers being given to under-16s, to announce a review into the use of hormones.

Dr Cass laid the groundwork for schools to introduce clearer guidance when dealing with trans children, ending the exclusion of parents from knowing.

She also recommended a 'follow-through service' for 17 to 25-year-olds to protect teenagers 'falling off a cliff edge' in care when they hit 17.

Rowling and supporters insist biologically male trans women should not be allowed in women's spaces nor to take part in women's sports.

She has also opposed new legislation in Scotland seeking to make it easier for trans people to change their legal gender.

Rowling has denied accusations she is transphobic, and police said recent tweets in which she 'misgendered' trans women did not fall foul of Scotland's new hate crime laws which outlaw 'stirring up' hate against transgender people.

Earlier today the writer doubled down in a new trans row by describing a transgender football manager as a 'straight, white, middle-aged bloke'.

Rowling hit back after being criticised for mocking Lucy Clark, 51, who has been appointed boss of fifth-division Sutton United's women's football team.

She tweeted sarcastically: 'When I was young all the football managers were straight, white, middle aged blokes, so it's fantastic to see how much things have changed.'

Today, after a suggestion she was 'comparing' Clark to a 'straight, white, middle-aged bloke', Rowling followed up with: 'I didn’t compare him to one. He IS one.'

Rowling's views on trans issues have brought her into dispute with some of the stars of the Harry Potter movies based on her books - including Daniel Radcliffe, who portrayed Harry, and Hermione Granger actress Emma Watson.

After the Cass report was published, one fan told Rowling they were 'just waiting for Dan and Emma' to offer a 'very public apology' knowing they'd be safe in the knowledge the author would forgive them.

Rowling responded: 'Not safe I'm afraid. Celebs who cosied up to a movement intent on eroding women's hard-won rights and who used their platforms to cheer on the transitioning of minors can save their apologies for traumatised detransitioners and vulnerable women reliant on single sex spaces.'

Radcliffe, 34, said last month: 'I will continue to support the rights of all LGBTQ people, and have no further comment than that.

'Jo, obviously Harry Potter would not have happened without her, so nothing in my life would have probably happened the way it is without that person.

Jeremy Vajko, 27, was arrested on Saturday night during violent clashes between police and protesters in the nation's capital.

He had been working as a senior engineer at Microsoft until May, but left the company and has been on the road, supporting the BLM movement, since then.

The Metropolitan Police Department incident report into his arrest claims he was driving recklessly near the Hay Adams hotel and drove 'into a crowd of over one hundred individuals'.

He spent the night in jail and was released on Sunday. Prosecutors are not pursuing the case.

On Monday, police chief Peter Newsham referred to the van and said it had also been spotted in Portland and Kenosha.

Jeremy Vajko has been arrested at least three times in protests in Portland and Washington DC since May. He is shown in mughots from Portland in June and July (above)

On Saturday night in Washington DC, Vajko was arrested in his 'snack van'. Police said he drove it into a crowd of 100 people- which he denies. Charges against him were dropped by prosecutors

He did not mention Vajko by name, but he and Mayor Muriel Bowsers both said the city was investigating whether or not funded groups traveled to the city to create havoc over the weekend.

'There was a reckless driving arrest that received a lot of attention.

'There was a van that was driving recklessly, potentially could have hit pedestrians and officers in the area. The driver was taken into custody.

'That vehicle was van, it was registered on the west coast in Washington state. We have intelligence to suggest that van was also at some of the violence we saw in Portland, Oregon and some of the violent activity we saw in Kenosha...

'One of the things that we're certainly going to do it if it is an organized, funded attempt to create violence in our city, we're going to do everything we can to get to the bottom of it,' he said.

Vajko has done multiple interviews since the riots began. He insists he is peaceful and is being unfairly targeted by police

'I think there's a potential that it could be the case... it could be domestic terrorism,' he said, talking more generally about the protests and unrest.

Mayor Bowser said that there was evidence that many had come from other cities and states.

'We've had experience all summer with protest and we're seeing a shift with who's involved and the type of tactics being used.

'I don't think anything that we have found can connect any outside protester to a single group or funded or organization. Though I don't think it would be a big leap to say that the type of organization and resources that they're bringing to bear are organized and funded. I don't think that would be a big leap.

'Our intelligence, I know the chief will tap into our federal resources as well, to find out any intelligence we can,' she said.

Vajko is from Seattle and, according to his LinkedIn page, works for Microsoft. On Twitter, he says he worked 'in tech'.

After being released from custody, he said he had just been handing out water.

'I was out there at the protest. I was handing out water, snacks, food and medical supplies. I had an EMT in my car... we were actively helping people and making s**t out there safe.

'As they were walking towards me, I tried to move out of the way. At which point, an officer violently smashed my window and grabbed me out of my vehicle and forced me onto the ground.

'They tried charging me with reckless driving however the District of Columbia asked them to release me and cancel the bond.

On Tuesday, after being released from custody without charge, Vajko complained online that police had 'ransacked' his vehicle

Videos show his van in the middle of the riot in DC on Saturday night. He claims he had a medic there to give out aid to anyone who was hurt

'I ended up for two days in jail in bad conditions, freezing conditions. They refused to give me a toothbrush... as it stands, I did not do anything criminal or wrong,' he said.

In June, Vajko was arrested in Portland for interfering with a police officer.

He was let go without bond. In July, he was arrested again in Portland on the same charge and with an additional charge of disorderly conduct. He was let go again.

DC Police Chief Peter Newsham on Monday said 'outside agitators' had caused most of the violence from the weekend's protests

In Kenosha, he claims he was stopped by police and had the van searched. It is unclear if he was arrested.

A Kenosha Police Department press release on August 27 refers to a group of vehicles that were stopped in a parking lot for acting suspiciously. The release did not give any of the group's names, but said they had helmets, protective vests and illegal fireworks in their vehicles.

Vajko claimed on social media at the time that he was pulled over for having an out-of-state plate. He said he was threatened by six cops, including one who had an 'AR'.

He insists that he is peaceful and has been acting alone since the start of the unrest in May.

He started in the autonomous zone in Seattle - that was known as CHAZ or CHOP - then started traveling around the country in his van to give out snacks because he 'noticed there were problems with nutrition'.

Videos he has posted online show right-wing group Proud Boys smashing the windows of his van in Portland.

He also claims he has been followed by under cover police units.

Right-wing commentators online call him a 'professional agitator' - a label he resists.

He did not immediately respond to DailyMail.com's inquiries on Tuesday but has said on Twitter that he is acting alone and is not part of any larger group or organization.

Thomas later appended an apparent disclaimer that said, '[Note: written before violence in US Capitol],' according to Mark Joseph Stern of Slate.com, who first wrote about the posts.

Her posts apparently upset some on the private Thomas Clerk World email list, which comprises her husband's staff over his three decades on the bench.

She has recently apologized, The Washington Post reported.

'I owe you all an apology. I have likely imposed on you my lifetime passions,' she wrote.

'My passions and beliefs are likely shared with the bulk of you, but certainly not all.

'And sometimes the smallest matters can divide loved ones for too long. Let's pledge to not let politics divide THIS family, and learn to speak more gently and knowingly across the divide.'

'I do not believe Trump is the one to lead our party and our country again, as president,' the Arkansas governor told Business Insider during the National Governors Association (NGA) Winter Meeting in Washington, D.C. over the weekend.

'And, you know, the Republican Party has many different voices,' Hutchinson added. 'And it's important in this time to have those voices and they should be concentrating on this election cycle.'

Hutchinson, who chairs NGA, has been critical of the former president since he left office – especially calling out his election fraud claims.

The comments from the governor came after video emerged of Trump declaring he is 'the 45th and the 47th' president during a round of golf.

Republican Senator Collins from Maine, however, signaled there is still a possibility she could support Trump.

'Can you imagine any circumstance where you could support his [Trump's] election in 2024?' ABC News This Week host George Stephanopoulos asked Collins.

'Why can't you rule out supporting him in 2024?' the TV host pressed.

'It's not likely given the many other qualified candidates that we have that have expressed interest in running,' she said. 'So it's very unlikely.'

The centrist senator, however, did not fully rule out backing the former president.

Trump has started to indicate more strongly his intentions of running for president again in 2024, inching further towards an announcement at his second rally of 2022 in Texas Saturday night. He has said since leaving office in January 2021 that he does not want to announce any bid until after the 2022 midterm elections.

The former president remains a divisive figure within the Republican Party, pushing some further to the right and others further to the political center.

Collins voted in favor of impeaching Donald Trump in his second trial when he was accused of inciting a riot after thousands of his supporters descended on the U.S. Capitol to try and push Congress not to certify the results of the 2020 election.

Trump was ultimately acquitted for a second time.

Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the daughter of former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee and Trump's former press secretary, is running to replace Hutchinson.

She launched her website in August 2019 as a prelude to her 2022 run and just days after Trump vacated office on January 25, 2021 announced that she is seeking to hold the post her father held from 1996-2007.

Sanders broke the Arkansas gubernatorial fundraising record by bringing in more than $9 million in the first six months of her campaign. She has pledged not to implement any mask or vaccine mandates in Arkansas.

Victim Mr Vorster told the court: 'David was playing gospel music on his guitar and the ladies were sharing cell phones photos and I saw him just stand up and drop his guitar.

'I could see fear in his eyes and at same time heard voices behind me and turned round and the attackers came straight for us and they had firearms that were pointed straight at us.

'I dropped the casserole I was holding and they were on top of me and had a knee pushed into my back and a firearm pushed into the back of my head until I was on the ground.

'I was told not to move and my mouth and nose was in the sand my arm up behind my back and then I heard a gunshot go off and then a sound like someone letting out a deep breath.

'I could hear David screaming in the background like a man being hurt and in a lot of pain.

'We were tied up with a sort of wire and I could hear them hitting David on his head asking where the money was – thumping noises followed by excessive noises showing his pain.

'I opened the safe but they just kept beating and beating until Brenda escaped and then they were gone and David and I got free and I raised the alarm at another farm', he said.

Police and paramedics raced to the remote farm but nothing could be done to save Heila who was certified dead at the scene from a single gunshot that perforated her heart.

Divorced David met South African born Brenda when she working at a school in Dubai and he was working for a US corporation and they married 7 years ago on a visit to the UK.

Churchgoing David is a father-of-two grown up sons who live in the UK and divorcee Brenda has a grown up son from a previous marriage and they left South Africa after the murder.

Cheney told CNN's Jake Tapper Friday that several GOP members of Congress told her they feared for their safety in the lead-up to February's vote to impeach Trump for inciting the January 6 Capitol riot.

The Wyoming Representative said she believes some fell in line with the wider party because of these concerns and insisted more lawmakers were in favor of his impeachment 'than are willing to say so'.

Cheney was ousted from her role as House Republican leader this week amid a backlash from staunch Trump allies.

The ex-number three in the party was one of just 10 House Republicans who voted to impeach Trump for his role in the violent insurrection. Since then, she has been a vocal critic of the former president and his efforts to overturn the result of the presidential election.

Liz Cheney told CNN Friday (above) some Republicans voted against impeaching Donald Trump because they were 'afraid for their lives' as she admitted she regrets voting for him in the 2020 election and warned he poses an 'ongoing danger' to America

'I think you have more members who believe in substance and policy and ideals than are willing to say so,' Cheney told CNN.

'If you look at the vote to impeach, for example, there were members who told me that they were afraid for their own security - afraid, in some instances, for their lives.

'And that tells you something about where we are as a country, that members of Congress aren't able to cast votes, or feel that they can't, because of their own security.'

Trump was acquitted in the Senate in a vote of 57-43 with just 10 Republicans crossing party lines and voting to convict.

Trump had pushed false election fraud claims since he lost the election to Joe Biden and, on the morning of the riot, held a 'Stop the Steal' rally where he told his supporters to 'fight.'

Cheney called Trump an 'ongoing danger' to the nation as she said we have to 'get to the bottom of what happened in 2020.'

'I think that people have been lied to,' she said.

'I think that it's really important for all of us to get to the bottom of what happened in 2020, what happened on January 6 and to go forward looking toward truth.'

She said she felt she had an 'obligation' to speak out against Trump's false election fraud claims and warned that 'we've had a collapse of truth in this country.'

'We've seen an evolution of, you know, a general situation where conspiracy theories are rampant, where good people in a lot of instances have been misled and believe things that are not true,' said Cheney.

Cheney speaks to the media after she was removed of her leadership role as Conference Chair Wednesday

'And so, I think that we all have an obligation to make sure we're doing everything we can to convey the truth, to stand for the truth and to stand for the Constitution and our obligations.'

She added: 'There's an ongoing danger and we've got to continue to stand up against it.'

Cheney went on to say that 'we have to save the Republican party' and hit out at people coming to Washington to be 'social media stars.'

Congress didn't used to 'have the vitriol flying back and forth that we certainly have over the last several years,' she said.

'People ought to want to be there and work hard and not be social media stars. That's not the right reason to be there,' she said.

Cheney did not cite any names however her opponent Trump was known to tweet copious amounts every day - until he was banned from Twitter, Facebook and other platforms for spreading misinformation.

Cheney was ousted from her position as the number three leader of the Republican party Wednesday during a closed-door meeting.

The Wyoming Representative said she believes some GOP members didn't impeach Trump as 'they were afraid for their lives'. Cheney was one of just 10 House Republicans who voted to impeach Trump (impeachment trial pictured above)

Republicans had earlier tried to remove her back in February.

Cheney has been one of the few members of the GOP to speak out against Trump and his pursuit to overthrow the election.

Trump continues to claim the election was 'stolen' from him despite dozens of lawsuits, state investigations and even his own Justice Department concluding that there was no evidence of widespread fraud.

Cheney has repeatedly referred to Trump's claims as his 'big lie' and blamed him for the Capitol riot, where a MAGA mob stormed the building in an effort to stop the election being certified for Joe Biden.

The congresswoman told ABC News Friday she regretted voting for Trump in the 2020 election but, as a Republican, 'was never going to' vote for the Democratic party.

'I was never going to support Joe Biden and I do regret the vote,' she said.

'It was a vote based on policy, based on substance and in terms of the kinds of policies he put forward that were good for the country.

'But I think it's fair to say that I regret the vote.'

She compared Trump and his false election fraud claims to the actions of the Chinese Communist Party.

'Frankly, it's the same kinds of things that the Chinese Communist Party says about democracy: that it's a failed system, and America is a failed nation,' Cheney said.

The Republican congresswoman told ABC News Friday she regretted voting for Trump in the 2020 election but 'was never going to vote for Joe Biden'

'I won't be part of that. And I think it's very important for Republicans who won't be part of that to stand up and speak out.'

While she has faced a backlash for speaking out against Trump, Cheney called on House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy - who has not condemned the former president - to testify about the events of January 6 in any commission that arises.

'I think that he very clearly and said publicly that he's got information about the president's state of mind that day,' Cheney said.

Rep. Jamie Herrera Beutler previously revealed he was present when McCarthy spoke to Trump on the phone during the riot.

He said McCarthy begged the president to call off his supporters.

Trump is said to have responded to the House Minority Leader - who was hiding from the violent mob at the time - ''Well, Kevin, I guess these people are more upset about the election then you are.''

Cheney said she 'wouldn't be surprised if [McCarthy] were subpoenaed' but that she hoped it wouldn't be necessary to get him to testify.

Staunch Trump ally New York Rep. Elise Stefanik was elected Cheney's replacement this week. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy and Stefanik Friday

New York Rep. Elise Stefanik was elected Friday as Cheney's replacement winning 134 to 46 of the vote.

Stefanik is a staunch Trump ally and opposed the certification of the electoral college votes in favor of Joe Biden back in January.

She has supported Trump's false claims of election fraud as well as conspiracy theories about votes in Arizona. Trump had also backed Stefanik to take on the role.

Cheney hit out at her successor calling it a 'dangerous' move to elect someone who has supported Trump's false claims.

'I think it's dangerous. I think that we have to recognize how quickly things can unravel,' she said.

'We have to recognize what it means for the nation to have a former president who has not conceded and who continues to suggest that our electoral system cannot function, cannot do the will of the people.'",Liz Cheney claims Republicans voted against impeaching Trump as they were 'afraid for their lives',1
https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-10540379/Disabled-Portland-Antifa-protester-60-shot-dead-BLM-protest-far-right-FURRY-43.html,1,"A 60 year-old Antifa activist was shot dead by a far-right furry while blocking traffic at a Black Lives Matter rally in Portland, it was claimed.

June Knight was shot in the head at point-blank range on Saturday at Normandale Park when the suspect, named as Benjamin Jeffrey Smith, 43, walked up to her and a group of protesters and shot her in the head at close range.

Smith is a machinist who is said to have posted regularly on far-right forums, backed Kyle Rittenhouse and moaned about crime in Portland also shot four other women, it is claimed. He is also said to be a member of the furry community, who dress up in cartoonish animal outfits and attend gatherings together.

After Smith allegedly shot and killed Knight, he was himself shot by another marcher who was armed. That marcher was arrested, but has since been freed by police, and has not been identified.

Smith remains critically-ill in hospital. The group who were marching did so to commemorate Patrick Kimmons, a black man shot and killed by Portland Police in 2018, as well as Minneapolis shooting victim Amir Locke.

Knight's wife Katherine Knapp said her late spouse would have reasoned with Smith and tried to de-escalate the situation.

'She would have been the one talking to him, to deescalate things,' she told the Oregonian. 'She was really good at that and trying to be human with him and trying to understand.'

Knightly, who was also known as T-Rex, was a mother to a grown-up son who was a longtime LGBT rights activist. She had survived from two rounds of cancer, her wife Katherine Knapp told the Oregonian, and was using a cane to get around while she waited on a knee replacement. She was also partially retired and operated a vape store is southeast Portland.

June Knightly, 60, who was a racial justice activist with a long-standing history in Portland, was killed on Saturday at Normandale Park when Benjamin Jeffrey Smith, 43, walked up to her and a group of women and shot her in the head at close range

Smith, who has lived across the street from the park for 14 years, said he had become increasingly angry at the demonstrations throughout the neighborhood had often criticized the Black Lives Matter movement. He reportedly shot three others, in addition to Knightly, and suffered a gunshot wound after a protester shot back at him

At the protest, Knightly was 'corking,' meaning she was stopping traffic along the route to ensure try and ensure the safety of other protesters.

In a Facebook post from October 2020. Knightly self-proclaimed to be 'born to cork' and that she was 'thankful for the opportunity to work with and learn from them.'

She first began shielding protesters from at a George Floyd protest. She and Knapp jumped in their car and ended up shielding protesters from motorists who were veering too close for comfort.

'She started doing that naturally and then it became her mission,' Knapp told the Oregonian. '[She wanted to] protect other protesters in any way she could.'

Knightly would go on to share her political opinions on her Facebook page, even making a picture of graffiti reading 'F**k Rittenhouse' as her cover photo and putting a filter on her profile picture reading: 'I have a healthy distrust of authority. And I'm vaccinated.'

A makeshift memorial has popped up in the park near the spot she died, many signs and candles and flowers have been left to honor her

Many tributes flooded social media, honoring Knightly for her hard work and her kind soul.

'She was a social justice advocate and an incredible human being who did nothing but try and love other humans. This is a tragedy!' her friend Chrisssy OT wrote on Facebook. 'I am just reeling today and so sad at her loss.'

Executive Director of ACLU of Oregon Sandy Chung wrote: 'I remember June protecting students marching to get an abusive police officer removed from their high school. Rest in power June. We honor & remember you.'

Knightly friend Mor Rioghan wrote on Twitter that her friend was 'beautiful, loving and dedicated.'

'I love you dearly and I'm so sorry for everything that happened. It was always a f**king honor to be at your side.'

An antifascist Twitter page wrote: 'All the love and solidarity goes out to the family and friends of June Knightly (T-Rex), who was murdered while protecting her community, and also the other victims of this attack. May her memory be a blessing.'

Flowers and a makeshift memorial have popped up at the spot where Knightly died in the park. Signs reading: T-Rex forever. End white supremacy' and 'Rest in [love], T-Rex. Protector' dotted the area.

However, those who knew Smith, who has lived across the street from the park for 14 years, said he had become increasingly angry at the demonstrations throughout the neighborhood and about the homeless people picking through his trash and living near the park. He was said to have often criticized the Black Lives Matter movement, and is also said to have posted on far-right internet forums using the handle Polybun.

He reportedly held up a gun to a homeless person who was found rooting through his trash, a neighbor recalled, and demanded the person leave.

'He has been getting more and more radicalized as the years went by,' his roommate Kristine Christenson told the Oregonian. 'He went from ‘FU police’ to ‘Blue Lives Matter’ in the last year.'

Christenson said Smith made her 'feel uncomfortable' and described her roommate as 'very fly off the handle.' Despite her negative feelings toward her roommate, Christenson said she was surprised when Smith hadn't returned home after the protest and even put a note on the door saying: 'Ben still hasn't come home, if you know anything, call me.'

'I thought it was bluff and bluster,' Christenson said.

Smith's brother Aurthur Killion, who lives in Indiana, told the Oregonian that his brother had repeatedly expressed growing antipathy toward the protest in the city and claimed they had 'threatened him and others personally in the past.'

Many wrote tribute posts for Knightly and called her 'beautiful, loving, and dedicated'

'He said he was ready to defend himself,' Killion told the Oregonian. 'He had no love for [left-wing activists], but he's not some right-wing nut job. He's a master machinist.'

He was also said to have been angered by the COVID-19 mandates, his roommate told the Oregonian, and he was known to collect guns. In addition, Smith was said to have made anti-Semitic comments on Reddit under the username Polybuns and praised Kyle Rittenhouse. He was also reportedly anti-fascist, neighbors said.

Smith is now under investigation and has not been charged with the shooting yet, but neighbors confirmed to the Oregonian that he was man with the gun. Hours after the shooting, police showed up to his apartment on the corner of Northeast 55th Avenue and Hassalo Street.

He is believed to have shot three other people, in addition to Knightly, and two of them remain in critical condition, with one being paralyzed.

Smith was also reportedly harmed when another protester fired back at him with a rifle, the Oregonian reported.

Smith was also reportedly looking to move out of Portland because it was 'getting too liberal here.'","Disabled Portland Antifa protester, 60, was shot dead at BLM protest 'by far-right FURRY, 43,'",1
https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/ap/article-14058173/Maccabi-Tel-Aviv-fans-clash-reported-pro-Palestinian-protesters-Ajax-Europa-League-match.html,1,"AMSTERDAM (AP) - Israeli fans were assaulted after a soccer game in Amsterdam by hordes of young people apparently riled up by calls on social media to target Jewish people, Dutch authorities said Friday. Five people were treated at hospitals and dozens were arrested after the attacks, which were condemned as antisemitic by authorities in Amsterdam, Israel and across Europe.

Reports of antisemitic speech, vandalism and violence have been on the rise in Europe since the start of the war in Gaza, and tensions mounted in Amsterdam ahead of Thursday night´s match between the Dutch team Ajax and Maccabi Tel Aviv.

Pro-Palestinian demonstrators were banned by local authorities from gathering outside the stadium, and video showed a large crowd of Israeli fans chanting anti-Arab slogans on their way to the game. Afterward, youths on scooters and on foot crisscrossed the city in search of Israeli fans, punching and kicking them and then fleeing quickly to evade police, Amsterdam Mayor Femke Halsema said.

On the social media platform Telegram, ""there is talk of people going on a Jew hunt,"" Halsema said. ""That is so shocking and so despicable that I still cannot fathom it."" Dutch Minister of Justice and Security David van Weel vowed to track down and prosecute the perpetrators.

Police had to escort some fans back to hotels, according to authorities.

Ofek Ziv, a Maccabi fan from the Israeli city of Petah Tikva, said someone threw a rock at his head, causing light bleeding, as he and a friend left the stadium. He said a group of men began to chase him, before he and his friend got into a taxi, picked up other fans and took shelter at a hotel.

""I´m very scared, it´s very striking,"" Ziv said. ""And the police didn´t come to help us.""

Another Israeli fan, Alyia Cohen, said upon arriving back in Israel that he would go back to Amsterdam for future matches. ""We are not afraid of anything, ours is the people of Israel.""

Five people were treated in the hospital and released, while some 20 to 30 people suffered light injuries, police said. At least 62 suspects were arrested, with 10 still in custody, the city's public prosecutor, René de Beukelaer, told reporters at a news conference Friday.

A statement from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu´s office said he ""views the horrifying incident with utmost gravity."" He demanded that the Dutch government take ""vigorous and swift action"" against those involved.

Condemnation of the violence poured in from around Europe. ""Antisemitism has absolutely no place in Europe, and we are determined to fight it and to fight all forms of hatred,"" said Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European Commission. ""We want Jewish life and culture to thrive in Europe.""

Dutch Prime Minister Dick Schoof condemned the violence and flew home early from a European Union summit in Hungary.

The attacks shattered Amsterdam´s long-cherished view of itself as a beacon of tolerance and haven for persecuted religions, including Sephardic Jews from Portugal and Spain who fled to the city centuries ago.

Police said security will be beefed up at Jewish institutions across the city, which has a large Jewish community and was home to Jewish World War II diarist Anne Frank and her family as they hid from Nazi occupiers.

Halsema, Amsterdam's mayor, described the violence as ""an eruption of antisemitism that we had hoped never again to see in Amsterdam.""

In the past, Ajax was known as a soccer club with links to Amsterdam´s Jewish community because visiting fans had to pass the city´s Jewish quarter to get to the club´s former stadium. Ajax fans sometimes wave Star of David flags and chant the Dutch word for Jews.

Israel's foreign minister, Gideon Saar, flew to Amsterdam on Friday and in a message on X he said that hatred of Jews is ""appearing in place after place after place.""

Saar met with the Dutch minister for security and justice, pledging Israeli help in the investigation, and also held talks with Geert Wilders, a far right, anti-Islam lawmaker whose party won national elections last year.

Amsterdam police spokeswoman Sara Tillart said it was too early in their investigation to say if anybody other than soccer fans was targeted. Authorities outlawed demonstrations across the city for the weekend and gave police extra powers to frisk people.

Israel´s government initially ordered two planes sent to Amsterdam to bring fans home, but Netanyahu's office later said it would work to help citizens arrange commercial flights.

Maccabi´s CEO, Ben Mansford, spoke to reporters at Israel´s international airport as some fans returned. ""Lots of people went to watch a football game ... to support Israel, to support the star of David,"" he said. For them to be attacked, ""that´s very sad times for us all given the last year we´ve had.""

Tensions had been brewing in Amsterdam for days ahead of the match. A Palestinian flag was torn down from a building in Amsterdam on Wednesday, Dutch broadcaster NOS reported, and authorities banned a pro-Palestinian demonstration near the stadium.

Ahead of the game, large crowds of supporters of the Israeli team could be seen on video chanting anti-Arab slogans as they headed to the stadium, escorted by police.

""Let the IDF win, and (expletive) the Arabs,"" the fans chanted, using the acronym of the Israeli military, as they shook their fists. It also showed police pushing several pro-Palestinian protesters away from a Maccabi fan gathering in a square earlier in the day.

Security issues around hosting games against visiting Israeli teams led the Belgian soccer federation to decline to stage a men´s Nations League game in September. That game against Israel was played in Hungary with no fans in the stadium.

Israel was exiled from the Asian Football Confederation in the 1970s after Arab nations refused to play against it. Israel played in European qualifying for the 1982 World Cup and has been a member of European soccer body UEFA since 1994.

The violence in Amsterdam will no doubt lead to a review of security at upcoming matches involving Israeli teams. UEFA had announced Monday that a Maccabi match initially to be played in Istanbul on Nov. 28 against the Turkish team Besiktas, would be moved to a yet-to-be-decided neutral venue.

Italian police said security was increased for Maccabi Tel Aviv´s basketball game at Virtus Bologna Friday night, both for fans and for the Maccabi team.

Israel´s national soccer team is scheduled to play France in Paris on Nov. 14 in the Nations League. French Interior Minister Bruno Retailleau said Friday the match would go ahead as planned.

""I think that for a symbolic reason we must not yield, we must not give up,"" he said, noting that sports fans from around the world came together for the Paris Olympics this year to celebrate the ""universal values"" of sports.

As demonstrators returned to the streets, police chiefs called for reform – and the US secretary of defense publicly rejected Donald Trump’s threat to deploy combat troops.

Floyd, a 46-year-old African American man, died in Minneapolis on 25 May when an officer kneeled on his neck for nearly nine minutes during an arrest. That officer, Derek Chauvin, was fired then charged with murder. On Wednesday afternoon Keith Ellison, the Minnesota attorney general, announced an elevated charge against Chauvin and charged three more officers with aiding and abetting.

Protests against police brutality and racism arose after Floyd’s death, before a crackdown by federal and state authorities led to the worst civil unrest in the US since the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr in 1968.

Curfews remain in place in most major US cities, dampening the potential for confrontation between protesters and police in the hours of darkness. On Tuesday, many marchers defied the deadline.

Minneapolis and St Paul, New York, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Phoenix, Atlanta and other cities remained largely peaceful. In cities including Portland, Oregon, and Tampa and St Petersburg in Florida, crowds were forcibly dispersed.

In Washington, where the area around the White House has seen intense clashes involving federal officers, demonstrators gathered calmly. On Wednesday, a crowd formed again in the capital. Thousands knelt and sang as law enforcement officers in riot gear stood watching over the crowd, which stretched down 16th Street near the White House.

Large, peaceful demonstrations continued coast-to-coast in cities including San Francisco, Los Angeles, Detroit and New York, and around the world, with passionate crowds gathering at the heart of London, as well as Helsinki and Stockholm.

In San Francisco, thousands gathered in the city’s Mission District on Wednesday. Among the “Black Lives Matter” and “defund the police” signs, Aztec dancers danced and protesters burned sage. Organizers handed out masks, gloves and water bottles.

Alongside chants of “George Floyd” and “Breonna Taylor”, protesters shouted the names of their own who were killed by police: Mario Woods. Jessica Williams. Alex Nieto. Oscar Grant in Oakland.

“They still feel like they can just kill us,” said 15-year-old McKinna Lincoln. Her mother, Mink Lincoln-Price, brought her five-year-old and seven-year-old sons with them to the protest.

Across the bay in Oakland a large group gathered in defiance of the city’s 8pm curfew. Thousands of protesters stepped into a major intersection and sat down, chanting their message loud and clear: “Fuck your curfew.”

As the US president continued to defend the decision to use rubber bullets and chemical agents against protesters around St John’s church on Monday, the defense secretary, Mark Esper, said he did not agree with Trump’s wish to use combat troops to impose or maintain order.

“I do not support invoking the Insurrection Act,” Esper told reporters at the Pentagon, referring to 1807 legislation which would allow the president to call in units moved close to Washington.

The White House press secretary, Kayleigh McEnany, later told reporters the Insurrection Act was “definitely a tool within [Trump’s] power”. She also declined to say if Trump might fire his defense secretary for his public comments. It was later reported that the Pentagon had reversed a decision to move combat units away.

Support for the movement came from prominent figures on Wednesday, including two former presidents. Jimmy Carter called for Americans in positions of power and influence to fight racial injustice, saying “silence can be as deadly as violence”, while Barack Obama, speaking at an event, said the urgency of the current moment was “as powerful and transformative as anything I’ve seen in recent years”.

Meanwhile Trump’s former defense secretary, James Mattis, delivered a blistering criticism of the president’s response to the protests, accusing him of abusing executive authority. “I have watched this week’s unfolding events, angry and appalled,” he said.

Elsewhere, a prominent African American police chief called for a ban on police chokeholds and restraints similar to that which killed Floyd, whose official autopsy ruled his death a homicide.

“We do not just need a nationwide ban,” Cerelyn Davis, the police chief of Durham, North Carolina, told ABC News. “We need nationwide standards. We need sweeping changes that are supported with legislation … to ensure that every agency large and small have the best practices in place or we are going to continue to see these [deaths].”

“The emotions and feelings that we see expressed out on the streets of cities all across the country going way back are substantiated,” Davis added. “There have been years and years of systemic racism in law enforcement.”

In New York in July 2014, a chokehold during an arrest resulted in the death of Eric Garner. His last words, “I can’t breathe”, became a rallying cry of the Black Lives Matter movement. Floyd said the same words as he lay handcuffed in Minneapolis on Memorial Day.

The New York police chief, Terrence Monahan, told ABC all police leaders needed to “take a good hard look at their agency, to bridge the gap between cops and community”.

“Whatever reforms there are it’s important that we see one another as human,” he said.

Police forces have been criticized for their heavy-handed response to protests, and several people have died since the unrest began. On Wednesday police in the San Francisco area said a man suspected of stealing from a pharmacy was fatally shot by officers who thought he was carrying a firearm in his waistband but actually had a hammer.

Floyd’s memorial service will be in Minneapolis on Thursday. His funeral will be in Houston, where he grew up, next week. Art Acevedo, the Houston police chief, rejected Trump’s threat to send troops into states that do not “dominate” protesters.

“This is Texas,” Acevedo told ABC, “cities are safe, things are going well here, we do not need any support in terms of federal troops.”

The Insurrection Act of 1807 was passed by Thomas Jefferson and last invoked in 1992, over riots in Los Angeles provoked by the police beating of Rodney King.

Trump has repeatedly said he thinks the US is in such a situation. On Monday, the president harangued governors on a call leaked to outlets including the Guardian. On Wednesday, he told Fox News Radio: “After we had the one evening which was a little rough, we brought in the troops.”

He also claimed he had not spent part of Friday night in a bunker under the White House, but had “inspected” it briefly during the day. That was contrary to multiple reports citing White House officials.

Trump also said protesters “burned down” St John’s church, where on Monday the president posed with a Bible, a controversial photo op staged to reassure evangelical supporters. In fact, the rector of the “Church of the Presidents” told parishioners a “small fire” damaged part of the basement.

Esper also addressed criticism for his decision, with Gen Mark Milley, chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, to walk with Trump to St John’s after peaceful protesters were forcibly cleared from the area. The defense secretary said he always “tried to stay apolitical” and had not been “aware that a photo op was happening”.

The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), meanwhile, filed a lawsuit against Minneapolis police and the Minnesota state patrol, alleging violations of the rights of journalists covering protests.

Journalists have been injured across the US. The lead plaintiff in the ACLU case is Jared Goyette, a freelance reporter who has covered the protests for the Guardian. He says he was shot in the face by a rubber bullet fired by police.

The developments are among a series of threatening or potentially threatening incidents amid the high-profile trials swirling around the former president.

The woman, Abigail Jo Shry of Alvin, called the federal courthouse in Washington, D.C. where judge Tanya Chutkan is overseeing the Trump case, allegedly saying, 'We want to kill you,' according to prosecutors.

That event, revealed in a filing by prosecutors, came during a week when Trump was at the center of attention in another cases, following his indictment by a grand jury in Fulton County, Georgia over his election overturn effort there.

In that case, the names of grand jurors were posted on far-right messages boards after they were included in the indictment. That happened on a site that has posted messages from 'Q' of the QAnon conspiracy theory. Other sites posted the names as part of a 'hit list.'

Abigail Jo Shry of Alvin, Texas, allegedly called the federal courthouse in Washington and left the threatening message - using a racist term for U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan - on August 5, court records show

Fulton County DA Fani Willis has herself been the recipient of racist attacks, she revealed weeks before the indictment.

Early this month, she forwarded to county commissioners one of the threats she said she has received, with the guidance to 'stay alert' and 'stay safe.'

She also forwarded an obscene message she said she received in the run up to the indictment of Trump and 18 other people, the Atlanta Journal Constitution reported.

It called her a 'corrupt (racial expletive),' threatening, 'You are going to fail, you Jim Crow Democrat (expletive).'

The threat against Chutkan came August 5, according to court records.

Trump this week put the judge back in the spotlight by going after her online, calling her 'highly partisan,' and calling out her language while sentencing a January 6 defendant. 'She obviously wants me behind bars. VERY BIASED & UNFAIR!.'

Chutkan had herself warned Trump not about attacks on herself, but against statements that might intimidate a witness or impact the jury pool. She said 'inflammatory statements' might cause her to have to speed up the trial due to jury considerations.

The Texas woman, a supporter of Donald Trump has been charged with threatening to kill the federal judge overseeing a criminal case against the former president, as well as a member of Congress.

Abigail Jo Shry of Alvin, Texas, allegedly called the federal courthouse in Washington and left the threatening message - using a racist term for U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan - on August 5, court records show.

'Hey, you stupid slave n****r,' she began the message, which she left at the judge's chambers at 7:50 p.m., according to Department of Homeland Security officials.

Investigators traced her phone number and she later admitted to making the threatening call, according to a criminal complaint.

In the call, Shry told the judge, who is overseeing the federal election interference conspiracy case against Trump, 'You are in our sights, we want to kill you,' the documents stated.

Judge Chutkan warned Trump against any harassment that might intimidate a witness or juror. She has now been the subject of a threatening phone call

Special prosecutor Jack Smith has indicted Trump for alleged crimes to obstruct the 2020 election results and also for his mishandling of classified documents. Trump also faces state charges in New York for alleged hush-money payments.

This week, the former president was also indicted in Georgia for his alleged role, along with 18 co-defendants, to overturn the 2020 presidential election in the state.

Smith has called for the trial on the federal election interference charges to start in July.

Prosecutors allege Shry also told Chutkan in the message, 'If Trump doesn't get elected in 2024, we are coming to kill you, so tread lightly b***h.'

She also threatened to kill U.S. Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee, a Texas Democrat running for mayor of Houston, according to court documents.

In addition, she set her sights on 'all Democrats in Washington D.C. and all people in the LGBTQ community.'

'You will be targeted personally, publicly, your family, all of it,' she added.

When she was questioned by DHS agents, Shry claimed she had no plans to go to Washington but said if Lee came to Alvin, 'then we need to worry.'

A judge earlier this week ordered Shry jailed.

On Monday, she was held without bond and charged with communicating a threat to injure another person across state lines, according to WUSA.

Shry has been charged four times in the last year on similar charges and has been jailed 30 times.

Prosecutors allege Shry also said, 'If Trump doesn't get elected in 2024, we are coming to kill you, so tread lightly b***h'

Shry also allgedly threatened Democratic Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee

She was out on bond on a July 11 charge of misdemeanor threat causing fear of imminent serious bodily injury when she threatened Chutkan.

Court records show Shry is represented by the Houston public defender´s office, which did not immediately return a message seeking comment on Wednesday. Shry is scheduled to appear at a full bond hearing on September 13.

Trump has publicly assailed Chutkan, a former assistant public defender who was nominated to the bench by President Barack Obama, calling her 'highly partisan' and ' VERY BIASED & UNFAIR!' because of her past comments in a separate case overseeing the sentencing of one of the defendants charged in the January 6, 2021, riot at the U.S. Capitol.

Chutkan in a hearing Friday imposed a protective order in the case limiting what evidence handed over by prosecutors the former president and his legal team can publicly disclose.

She warned Trump´s lawyers that his defense should be mounted in the courtroom and 'not on the internet.'

Chutkan also warned the former president's lawyers he could face a faster trial if he keeps making 'inflammatory' statements that could taint the jury pool.

In a stern message, she said she would not let the trial over allegations he subverted the 2020 election turn into 'a carnival atmosphere of unchecked publicity and trial by media.'",Texas woman arrested for threatening to 'kill' Jamaica-born judge Trump called 'biased and unfair' after Q-linked site doxxes Fulton County grand jurors and racist attack on Georgia prosecutor,1
https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-10258279/Trump-called-aides-Willard-Hotel-command-center-halt-Bidens-win-Jan-6-Report.html,1,"Donald Trump (pictured at his Stop the Steal rally on January 6) reportedly called aides at the Willard Hotel the night before the Capitol riot to discuss ways to overturn to election

Former President Donald Trump phoned his 'top lieutenants' stationed at the Willard Intercontinental Hotel in Washington, DC to discuss ways to steal the election hours before his supporters stormed the US Capitol, according to a report in The Guardian.

Trump's top supporters in his effort to overturn Joe Biden's 2020 victory allegedly plotted how to prevent Congress certifying the election results from the upscale hotel the day before the riot.

The group was led by Rudy Giuliani, Steve Bannon, former strategic adviser Boris Epshteyn and lawyer John Eastman. Trump adviser Jason Miller and former New York City police commissioner Bernard Kerik, a top deputy of Giuliani's, were also reportedly in attendance.

Trump spokeswoman Liz Harrington told DailyMail.com that The Guardian's report 'is totally false.'

On the evening of January 5 Trump reportedly made separate calls to his legal and non-legal aides to discuss avenues to stop the next day's vote certification and delay the process until Congress received a new slate of electors.

The report claims the calls were separate on Giuliani's insistence it would maintain attorney-client privilege. It also cites 'multiple sources' without going into further detail on whether they were even present.

The calls, which would directly link the former president to his associates' efforts to overturn a democratic election, reportedly took place a day after Eastman unveiled a memo outlining a theory of how then-Vice President Mike Pence could reject the existing results.

The Willard Intercontinental Hotel (pictured) was allegedly a 'command center' for members of Trump's orbit the night before the Capitol riot where they discussed ways to upend Joe Biden's 2020 victory on the basis of 'election fraud'

Pence as vice president would oversee Congress' certification of electoral college votes. But according to Eastman, Pence could also use his role to kick the election down to the House or stop the session altogether and demand states send different electors over 'election fraud' concerns.

The Eastman memo was first reported in the book 'Peril' written by Washington Post journalists Bob Woodward and Robert Costa.

Trump allegedly complained about Pence's refusal to go along with the plan in some of his first calls to the Willard from the White House.

Between the evening of January 5 and the morning of January 6 Trump reportedly told Bannon that Pence was 'arrogant' and recounted the meeting during which the vice president told Trump to count him out of any efforts to question the election.

On at least one other call, Trump asked his legal team to delay Congress' certification until after January 6 to at least buy time to wage a pressure campaign on states to send new electors.

Steve Bannon and Rudy Giuliani were named as alleged participants in some of those calls

However the report notes that it's unclear if Trump talked about stopping Biden's victory 'by any means' after Pence refused to intervene, though if true the comments would align him closer with insurrectionists who stormed the Capitol looking to take back the election for Trump.

Multiple Trump lawyers there that night reportedly denied that Trump was looking to overturn the election but instead the team was only considering ways to delay it over 'election fraud' allegations.

Earlier this month the House Select Committee investigating January 6 announced it was looking into the alleged events at the Willard.

Today a federal appeals court will consider Trump's bid to stop the committee from accessing his White House's documents that the National Archives had already agreed to turn over.

On November 8 the panel announced subpoenas for Eastman, Miller and Kerik over their actions leading up to the Capitol riot including that meeting.

'In the days before the January 6th attack, the former President’s closest allies and advisors drove a campaign of misinformation about the election and planned ways to stop the count of Electoral College votes,' committee chair Democrat Rep. Bennie Thompson of Mississippi said at the time.

If true the allegations in the report would create a more direct link between Trump and his supporters who stormed the Capitol

'The Select Committee needs to know every detail about their efforts to overturn the election, including who they were talking to in the White House and in Congress, what connections they had with rallies that escalated into a riot, and who paid for it all.'

It's unclear if the panel already knew about Trump's alleged calls. DailyMail.com has reached out to the committee for comment on Tuesday's report.

Bannon, an alleged participant at the January 5 'command center,' was slapped with criminal charges for refusing to testify in front of the Democrat-led committee.

He was among the first high-profile figures in Trump's orbit to be subpoenaed in lawmakers' quest to know more about the events leading to the insurrection.

On Wednesday the committee will be voting on whether to refer another Trump lackey, former Justice Department lawyer Jeffrey Clark, for criminal contempt charges as well.",Trump called aides at Willard Hotel 'command center' over how to halt Biden's win on Jan 6: Report,1

Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer joined George Stephanopoulos to promote his new book The Authority Of The Court And The Peril Of Politics, but it wasn't long before the TV host brought up the controversial abortion ban.

'I thought it was a very bad decision and I dissented,' he told Stephanopoulos on Good Morning America.

Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer told George Stephanopoulos that he thought the Court's decision on the Texas abortion ban was a 'very bad' one

Breyer, 83, told Stephanopoulos that the court doesn't 'trade votes,' but did highlight that other Justices emphasized judicial philosophies such as greater emphasis on following the original texts of the constitution when deciding their rulings.

The liberal justice, who is the oldest member on the court, said he emphasized more purposes and late Justice Antonin Scalia was text-based.

He also emphasized the need for a 'rule of law,' citing other countries like Ghana, he cited, which does not, where citizens use guns and violence to solve problems.

He claimed a 'rule of law' is a 'treasure' that US citizens should value.

Breyer went on to say: 'The Supreme Court has had many ups and down,' before citing Plessy vs Ferguson - the case that upheld the ""separate but equal"" racial segregation stance - as a down, and Brown vs Board of Education, which outlawed racial segregation in education, as an up.

The court denied the request from Texas abortion providers to place a temporary hold on the state's proposed abortion law, which bans Texas women from getting an abortion as early as six weeks.

In the 5-4 ruling, Justice Breyer, Chief Justice John Roberts, Justice Sonia Sotomayor and Justice Elena Kagan dissented

When questioned about the January 6 riot at the US Capitol, Breyer admitted he 'was worried' about it, and implied it was symptomatic of ongoing tribal political divisions in the United States.

He said: 'I am worried. I am worried people don't understand it. I am worried that children in schools don't understand their government. I am worried if they don't teach what their government is about. And I'm very worried if they don't participate.

'If they don't participate in practice with other people, then they won't have trust with our institutions...And if they don’t have trust in institutions, it becomes difficult, if not impossible, to live in a society of 331 million people of tremendous diversity.'

Texas's abortion ban does not allow abortions after a heartbeat is detected, unless the mother's health is in danger. There are no exceptions for rape or incest.

The Texas law drew even more controversy as it isn't enforced by the state but by Texas's own private citizens.

The law that took effect on September 2 allows any private citizen to sue Texas abortion providers who violate the law, as well as anyone who 'aids or abets' a woman getting the procedure.

The statute, which survived a Supreme Court challenge and Breyer's dissent, sets minimum damages of $10,000 per banned abortion, to be paid out to the first person to prevail in a suit over the procedure.

He also 'worried' people did not understand their government and citizens would eventually stop trusting the country's institutions

Abortion patients themselves cannot be sued, but the 'aiding and abetting' clause is broad, and might even apply to a cab driver who knowingly takes a woman to get a banned abortion.

By handing off enforcement to private citizens, Texas avoided the legal pitfalls that doomed similar efforts in other states - but critics say that the move amounts to a hack of the legal system.

'The most pernicious thing about the Texas law it sort of creates a vigilante system where people get rewards,' President Joe Biden said on September 3. 'I know this sounds ridiculous. It's almost un-American what we're talking about.'

Known as the Heartbeat Act, the Texas law bans abortions after ultrasounds can detect a fetal heartbeat, which can occur as early as six weeks.

The abortion ban makes medical exceptions to save the life of the mother, but allows no exemptions for cases of rape or incest.

The new law allows anyone to bring a suit against abortion providers, regardless of whether they have been personally harmed.",Justice Stephen Breyer calls SCOTUS decision to allow Texas abortion ban 'very bad',1

Trump has effectively barred asylum seekers from entering the US by threatening to impose tariffs and cut foreign aid to Central American countries.

Evan Neumann, 48, was charged in July on six separate criminal charges, including violent entry and disorderly conduct on Capitol grounds, as well as for assaulting, resisting and obstructing law enforcement at the Capitol insurrection on January 6.

Shortly after the charges were filed, Neumann sold his house in California's Bay Area for $1.3 million and fled. He is listed by the FBI as a 'defendant at large'.

He has now emerged in Belarus, where Alexander Lukashenko - infamous for imprisoning his political rivals and for coming under fire during violent crackdowns following his highly disputed election victory in August 2020 - has been in power for 26 years.

In a sit-down interview titled 'Goodbye, America' released on Sunday, he told Belarus 1 that he is facing six criminal charges back in the United States.

Neumann said: 'I do not believe that I have committed any crime. One of the charges was very offensive.

'It is alleged that I hit a police officer. There is no reason for this.

'This is terrible... This is political persecution. And this is a level with which I cannot do anything.'

Evan Neumann, 48, appeared on Belarus 1 on Sunday for a sit-down interview for a segment entitled Goodbye, America

He spoke to a reporter about how he fled the United States as he faced six charges for his alleged involvement in the January 6 riots

In the interview, he tells a reporter for the state-run television network what he went through, as Belarus 1 tries to paint him as an average American fleeing political persecution.

'Judging by his story, [Neumann] is the same type of simple American whose shops were burned by Black Lives Matter activists,' a Belarus TV channel presenter said as he introduced Neumann.

He added that Neumann had been 'politically active,' but did not have access to state secrets.

'However, something makes him flee from the country of fabulous freedoms and opportunities, as we used to believe,' the reporter stated, saying that Neumann 'sought justice and asked uncomfortable questions' following the 2020 presidential election 'but lost almost everything and is being persecuted by the U.S. government.'

To get to Belarus, Neumann flew to Italy, then got on a train to Switzerland, and drove to Ukraine via Germany and Poland. Once in Ukraine, he rented an apartment for six months but claims he was being followed by the Ukrainian secret service. He then says he crossed illegally into Belarus by wading through swamps, and dodged wild hogs and snakes. He was held by Belarusian border authorities on August 15.

On Sunday, Neumann denied in an interview with Belarus 1 that he did anything wrong, as the state-run media tried to paint him as an average American

The FBI obtained body-worn camera footage showing Neumann pushing a metal barricade into Metropolitan police officers at the January 6 insurrection at the Capitol

He was seen wearing a red Make America Great Again hat, a black jacket, a dark-colored backpack as well as a yellow and orange scarf he obtained when he allegedly participated in the Ukrainian Revolution

According to an indictment against Neumann, he refused orders to move away from the metal barricades, telling the officers: 'No, you can't tell me what to do, you piece of s***'

According to an indictment against Neumann, the FBI received body-worn camera footage from the Metropolitan Police Department that showed him assaulting an officer at the Capitol riot on January 6.

The riot began when a group of Stop The Steal protesters marched on the Capitol in an effort to prevent Congress from certifying the results of the 2020 presidential election.

The rioters apparently organized to meet at the Save America rally, protesting the results of the 2020 presidential election as former President Donald Trump claimed there was election fraud, and began descending on Congress shortly after 1pm.

At around 1.37pm, the indictment against Neumann states, he was seen wearing a red 'Make America Great Again' hat, an orange and yellow scarf, a dark-colored Dakine backpack with a red logo, a black coat and blue jeans, with a gas mask and a red mouthpiece around his neck.

He was standing by the barricades Metropolitan Police put up around the Capitol when he started to berate the police at the scene, speaking directly to them as he said they are 'defending the people who are going to kill your f****** children.

'They are going to kill your f****** children, they are gonna rape them, they are gonna imprison them, and you're defending the people that are going to do this to your children,' he said, according to the indictment.

His claims seemed to echo those from the widespread QAnon conspiracy theory movement, which holds that Trump is waging a secret war against a global cabal of elite Satan worshipping pedophiles in government, business and the media.

Its followers believe Trump will expose the pedophiles, order its members be arrested and sentenced to death.

At the riot, the indictment alleges, Neumann refused orders to move away from the metal barricades, telling the officers: 'No, you can't tell me what to do, you piece of s***.'

He later allegedly berated one of the officers, only identified as 'J.M,' saying that officers 'kneel to Antifa because they're little b******'. He then also allegedly threatened J.M. and said that the officers will be 'overrun' by the crowd, telling him: 'I'm willing to die, are you?'

As the crowd around him became more aggressive in their push to enter the Capitol, it is alleged Neumann tried to shove the barricade into J.M. and push it into the line of officers.

Eventually, he allegedly punched J.M., and the crowd succeeded in breaking down the barrier.

J.M. then tried to wrestle the metal barricade out of Neumann's hands, the indictment states, but Neumann used it as a battering ram, lifted it off the ground and used it to strike the officer.

The FBI later found Neumann leaving his house in Mill Valley, California on February 16 - after he was identified as the suspect in the footage - and heading to the international terminal at San Francisco International Airport.

There, agents wrote in the indictment, Neumann had admitted to flying to Washington D.C. on January 5 and departing on January 7.

He also reportedly admitted that he interacted with law enforcement on his trip, but did not provide any details.

It is unclear why he was able to travel to the airport as he was under investigation, and whether the FBI had seized his passport. DailyMail.com has reached out to the FBI for more information.

By April, though, ABC 7 reports, he had sold his home in Mill Valley for $1.3 million, and when reporters tried to contact him after the charges were filed, the real estate agent who sold his home said he went to Ukraine.

Neumann had previously attended the Ukrainian Revolution in 2004 and 2005, the FBI found, and a review of public records conducted by DailyMail.com shows that he has a pilot's license and a private airplane.

He also reportedly has two children and a brother, Mark Neumann, who told ABC 7 back in July that he had no knowledge of his brother's whereabouts.

He claimed that he was invited into the Capitol after someone broke through the window, and added that he is now on the FBI's Most Wanted Criminals List.

He said he knew he would be identified as one of the rioters soon after the FBI asked for help in identifying him.

'I have many friends working for the government,' he explained. 'I knew that they would immediately identify me and therefore [I] left the first thing.

'I started hiding, traveling across America from one point to another.

'I hired a lawyer, and the lawyer said that I could go to Europe on a business trip.'

According to public records, Neumann owns a handbag company and has been involved in the hospitality industry, developing software to make the reservation process easier.

'The lawyer said it was good because it would buy me time, and then it will become clear what is happening with my affairs,' he told Belarus 1.

'After all, no court proceedings were carried out, so in order to understand what was happening, I left.'

He then described how he originally flew to Italy in March, before getting on a train to Switzerland and then driving to Ukraine via Germany and Poland.

Once in Ukraine, Neumann said, he rented an apartment in the city of Zhytomyr for four months, but, he said, within two weeks, he realized he was being followed by the Ukrainian secret service, the SBU.

It was at that point, he said, that he decided to illegally cross into Belarus.

But to do so, he said, he had to wade through swamps, and dealt with wild hogs as he also tried to avoid snakes, before he finally crossed the border into Belarus and sought asylum.

Belarusian border authorities reportedly detained Neumann on the border with Ukraine on August 15.

Belarusian migration authorities declined to comment to the Moscow Times, which first reported on Neumann's interview, citing confidentiality of personal data.

They did note, however, that at least three United States citizens have applied for asylum in Belarus so far in 2021.

The country is facing increasing unemployment, with an average of family of four spending about 4,123.54 Belarusian rubles - the equivalent to $1,685.28 - for goods each month, not including rent, according to Numbeo.

A single person's estimated expenses are 1,146.05BYN, or $468.39, and it is estimated to be 65.6 percent cheaper than New York.

The average Belarusian household makes about 1450 BYN each month, which amounts to 17,400 BYN each year.

Belarus does not have an extradition treaty with the United States, and relations between the two countries have been frayed since American officials accused Belarus's August 2020 presidential election of being rigged. Its president, Alexander Lukashenko, who has been referred to as Europe's last dictator, has ruled the country for nearly 27 years.

He has claimed he won the August 2020 election, but many of his opponents had been arrested in the lead up to the election, according to the BBC, and American officials have also found evidence that he actually lost to challenger Svetlana Tikhanovskaya.

But widespread protests against the election were violently shut down, and an opposition journalist, Roman Protasevich, was arrested after the Ryanair plane he was traveling on was forced to land in Minsk in June. He reportedly told a fellow passenger at the time: 'A death penalty awaits me here.'

Belarusian state TV, though, said Protasevich faced up to 15 years in prison, primarily for 'organizing large-scale mass unrest' and 'inciting hatred towards government and police.'

Lukashenko has rejected international condemnation that the plane diversion was an act of 'air piracy' or 'hijacking,' staged to arrest a political opponent.

He insisted there was a genuine bomb threat on board the plane, and acted 'legally' to 'save lives.'

Meanwhile, the U.S., Britain and the European Union have imposed sanctions on the country for his violent crackdown on mass protests to his disputed win, and now Lukashenko has flown in Middle Eastern and African migrants to his country to overwhelm the international system.

On Monday, desperate migrants gathered at the Belarusian frontier with Poland, attempting to hack down a barbed-wire fence only to meet a phalanx of Polish guards who forced them back with pepper spray.

Warsaw called the action 'an invasion' and declared it was sending 12,000 troops to reinforce 10,000 already stationed along the frontier.

A NATO official called the use of migrants 'a hybrid tactic', meaning a combined military-political operation, and said: 'NATO stands ready to further assist our allies, and maintain safety and security in the region'.

EU chief Ursula von der Leyen on Monday called on member states to impose new sanctions against Belarus and said the use 'of migrants for political purposes is unacceptable'.

She added that the EU would also look at how to sanction 'third-country airlines' that bring migrants to Belarus.

But Russian authorities have declared their support of Lukashenko and Belarus' role in the crisis.

Dmitry Peskov, spokesman for Russian President Vladimir Putin said: 'We have no doubt that the Belarusian migration service is taking all necessary steps to keep everything legal.

'Of course, we do not doubt that [they are] taking into account [our] considerations and possible concerns in regard to the fact that migrants may end up in our territory as well.'

'Measures are being taken, but the situation is, of course, tricky.'",Capitol rioter wanted by FBI for attacking cops gets asylum in Belarus,1
https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/apr/29/josh-hawley-book-attacks-big-tech,1,"Senator Josh Hawley of Missouri accuses the US’s biggest tech companies of committing the “gravest threat to American liberty since the monopolies of the Gilded Age” in his upcoming book. He rails that tech giants Amazon, Google and Facebook “have become a techno-oligarchy with overwhelming economic and political power”.

Hawley has also invested potentially tens of thousands of dollars in the very companies he denounces, according to public financial disclosure records examined by the Guardian.

Hawley’s new book, The Tyranny of Big Tech, is published next week by Regnery Publishing. Simon & Schuster, its original publisher, dropped the book following the Missouri senator’s involvement in the 6 January electoral college vote certifying Joe Biden’s election.

In the book, Hawley compares today’s tech titans to the “robber baron” industrialists who dominated the US economy in the 19th century, whose monopoly powers were attacked by Theodore Roosevelt, the subject of a previous Hawley book.

“Theodore Roosevelt had balked at the monopolies of his day that had consolidated power and crowded out the common man, but the the robber barons’ power over everyday Americans was nothing compared to was nothing compared to that wielded by big tech,” Hawley writes.

But according to Senate financial disclosures, the senator’s disdain for big tech does not extend to his investment portfolio.

Hawley and his wife each have somewhere between $1,000 and $15,000 invested in Vanguard Growth Index Fund ETF, which has holdings in Google parent Alphabet, Amazon, Apple and Facebook. The disclosures do not offer exact amounts of holdings, only a range.

The Hawleys held considerably more cash in Vanguard funds in 2018, according to his disclosures. The couple held between $50,001 and $100,000 in Vanguard Dividend Appreciation ETF, between $50,001 and $100,000 in Vanguard Growth ETF and another $50,001 to $100,000 in Vanguard Value ETF.

Hawley is a long-time critic of tech power. Before taking his seat in the Senate in 2019 he was Missouri’s attorney general and opened investigations into Facebook, Google and Uber.

It’s not unusual for senators to have mutual funds while serving in Congress or for lawmakers to have investments in individual stocks. But it’s a counterintuitive decision for Hawley. The Missouri senator, educated at Stanford University and Yale Law School, has made fighting “big tech” one of his signature issues. He’s also been mentioned as a potential 2024 presidential candidate. Hawley is one of a number of young Republican senators who have prioritized rebranding the Republican party as a nemesis of big tech, China and aspiring populist champion of the American working class.

Hawley drew criticism for leading the charge of congressional lawmakers in early January seeking to challenge Biden’s victory over Donald Trump in the 2020 presidential elections. That push incited a violent riot at the Capitol where Trump supporters broke into Congress.

In a statement to the Guardian, a spokesperson for Hawley said: “The Hawleys don’t own any stock. They have their savings in mutual funds. Some politicians enrich their families by landing them board seats on Ukrainian oil and gas companies and multi-million dollar salaries but the liberal media insists that isn’t newsworthy. But if you’re a Republican, just investing in mutual funds – just like millions of hardworking Americans do – is considered controversial.”

The disclosures also show that Hawley is invested in another of his persistent targets: China.

Hawley has between $1,000 and $15,000 invested in iShares MSCI Emerging Markets ETF, which holds stakes in some of China’s biggest companies, including Alibaba, Ping An Insurance group and Tencent.

According to the New York Times, Alibaba’s cloud computing business showed its clients how they could use its software to detect the faces of Uyghurs and other ethnic minorities currently being persecuted.

Last year Hawley launched an attack on China, claiming “imperialist China seeks to remake the world in its own image, and to bend the global economy to its own will”.

“For decades now, China has bent, and abused, and broken the rules of the international economic system to its own benefit,” he said in a Senate speech.

“They have stolen our intellectual property and forced our companies to transfer sensitive trade secrets and technology. They have manipulated their currency and cheated time and again on their trade commitments. They have been complicit in the trafficking of persons and relied upon the forced labor of religious minorities,” he said.",Josh Hawley rails at big tech firms but records show he has invested in them,1

In the 1990s, however, her remarkable equilibrium was tested far more than we ever knew.

According to a friend of hers, she was at her 'wits' end' when both Charles and Andrew's marriages collapsed, wondering aloud when her family, and the monarchy, would finally be given some respite.

In particular, Charles and Diana's decision to separate affected the Queen so deeply that she allowed herself to stray from the ingrained habits of a lifetime.

No longer did she have just one dry martini in the evenings; her staff noticed that Her Majesty's modest consumption of alcohol had noticeably increased.

In private, the Monarch, known for both her moderation and her iron grip on her emotions, was quietly signalling her distress.

With two sons mired in scandal, she had much to contend with.

On the one hand, she abhorred divorce; and on the other, she was ever protective of the dignity of the Crown.

So how did the Queen negotiate this turbulent period of recent royal history?

Back in 1992, my best-selling book on Diana, written with her full cooperation, largely examined her doomed marriage through her eyes.

But candid and searing as her testimony was, it could not tell the whole story.

Diana and Fergie told their mother-in-law about their marital problems with her sons which 'the Queen had come to dread' (Pictured) The Princess of Wales and the Queen attend the Opening of Parliament in London, November 1982 - Diana is wearing a white fur coat and the Spencer tiara

As the Queen's latest biographer, I've been able to draw on 40 years of reporting on the British monarchy, as well as on largely off-the-record interviews with many courtiers and royal staff.

The picture that emerges reveals she was dragged, against her natural inclinations, into an emotional maelstrom.

Both young women had started off so well, impressing their future in-laws with their jaunty upper-class jollity.

When Sarah Ferguson started dating Prince Andrew, the Queen Mother declared: 'She's so English' — a high compliment in her lexicon.

And when Diana Spencer paid her first visit to Balmoral in 1980, as the guest of Prince Charles, the Queen concluded with some satisfaction: 'She's one of us.'

Only Diana's own grandmother, Lady Fermoy, sounded a note of caution, telling her: 'Darling, you must understand that their sense of humour and lifestyle are very different, and I don't think it will suit you.'

As Charles's courtship progressed, Diana became concerned about the looming presence of his ex-mistress, Mrs Camilla Parker Bowles.

Even so, she agreed to marry him when he proposed in February 1981.

For her part, the Queen was delighted at the couple's engagement, believing that Diana's supportive, positive nature and girlish high spirits would make an ideal foil for her often disconsolate, melancholic son.

Going out of her way to make Diana feel welcome, she deputed several courtiers to show her the ropes and installed her in the principal guest room at Windsor Castle, while Charles was away overseas.

Although she was busy, 'the Queen made a big fuss over Diana,' according to a former courtier, setting aside as much time for her as possible.

By then, Diana was suffering from the eating disorder bulimia nervosa, a condition of bingeing and forced vomiting. She went to the kitchens so often that the chefs suspected she was spying on them, and the Queen had to ask her tactfully to stop her visits.

What she didn't realise was that Diana went there to gorge on packets of cereal and cream. Then she'd make herself sick afterwards.

Fully and enthusiastically invested in her son's marriage, the Queen herself paid £28,000 for Diana's oval sapphire-and-diamond engagement ring, and footed the bill for the opulent gala ball held at Buckingham Palace on the week of the wedding.

As we know, the couple's Mediterranean honeymoon was a disaster: the Princess had been consumed with jealousy of Charles's former mistress, Camilla Parker Bowles, and suffering from a combination of exhaustion and bulimia.

During the next leg, an extended stay at Balmoral, she had wild mood swings, often choosing to remain in her room rather than join the family for picnics or barbecues.

This irritated the Queen.

Not only was it a discourtesy to her as host but also it interrupted the smooth running of the castle, necessitating the changing of staff rotas so someone was always at Diana's disposal.

Diana texted 'The redhead's in trouble,' after shots of a topless Duchess of York having her toes sucked by her 'financial adviser', John Bryan, were published. Privately, Charles and Diana had already agreed to separate (Pictured) Princess Diana And The Duchess Of York Stand Together As They Watch A Polo Match In Windsor, Berkshire

But she concluded that her daughter-in-law needed time and space to adjust to the drastic change in her circumstances.

And when Diana announced she was pregnant that autumn, the Queen hoped motherhood would put an end to her 'little local difficulties'.

With every passing day, however, it became clearer that the marriage wasn't working.

In January 1982, the couple had a blazing row at Sandringham about what Diana considered to be Charles's indifferent attitude towards her.

What took place next shocked the Queen.

Diana, according to her account, threw herself down the steps at the North End staircase, which led to the Queen Mother's rooms.

Even though she was in tears, Charles accused her of crying wolf and stalked out of the house to go riding.

As she lay in a crumpled heap, Her Majesty was one of the first to arrive on the scene.

Diana later told me: 'The Queen comes out, absolutely horrified, shaking — she was so frightened.'

Her immediate concern was that Diana might suffer a miscarriage.

Others who were present recall a less dramatic encounter.

They say that Diana seemed to trip as she was walking down the stairs and ended up at the bottom of the staircase by the corgis' food bowls, which the Queen Mother was replenishing at the time.

The Queen, and other members of the family, were alerted to the incident by a page.

When they arrived, Diana was already dusting herself off.

She apologised for the fuss and said she was absolutely fine.

A few months after William was born, the tide of public opinion was starting to turn against the Princess.

She was accused of being a 'fiend' and a 'monster' by an influential gossip columnist, and deemed responsible for a wave of staff departures, including Charles's bodyguard, valet and private secretary.

The Queen, at this point, decided to demonstrate she had confidence in her daughter-in-law.

Diana had already asked Charles and the Queen's private secretary if she could represent the family at the funeral of Princess Grace in Monaco, but they'd turned down her request.

Now the Queen gave Diana her permission to go ahead — a ringing endorsement that did not go unnoticed.

There was more cause for hope in July 1986, when a beaming Prince Andrew watched Sarah Ferguson walk down the aisle of Westminster Abbey on their wedding day.

In a letter to the Queen, the Queen Mother complimented the bride: 'She is such a cheerful person, and seems to be so thankful & pleased to be part of a united family, & is truly devoted to darling Andrew.

It seems most hopeful which is a comfort.'

Unspoken, but understood, was the implication that this marriage would thrive, unlike that of the Prince and Princess of Wales.

By July 1986, they were living separate lives: Charles was back with Camilla and Diana was finding comfort in the arms of her bodyguard Barry Mannakee.

During Andrew and Sarah's wedding ceremony, the Princess had looked unusually distracted.

It was because she'd just learned that, following a complaint from a fellow protection officer, Mannakee had been moved from her detail.

Her mother-in-law's fervent wish was that the endlessly upbeat Fergie would jolt the Princess of Wales out of her sullen moods.

And to a large extent she did — though not in a way that the Queen ultimately welcomed.

Their joint capers began on Andrew's stag night, when Diana, Fergie and several friends dressed as policewomen, intending to 'arrest' the Prince at the house where his party was taking place.

Afterwards, the women ended up in Annabel's nightclub, drinking cocktails.

Once the story got out, the Monarch was deeply annoyed that the future Queen of England had been spotted roaming around London dressed as a police officer, which was technically a criminal offence.

Diana was called in to see her.

The Princess defended her behaviour, however, as being no more than light-hearted fun.

Allergic, as always, to any kind of emotional confrontation, the Queen did not press the matter further.

Charles went to Camilla and Diana begged for a divorce (pictured) Prince Charles and Princess Diana on their last official trip together - During a visit to the Republic Of Korea they attended a Presidential banquet at The Blue House in Seoul

But the general silliness continued: later that year, Fergie encouraged Diana to join her in a can-can at Windsor Castle; then, the following year, they pushed and shoved one another at a photocall on the ski slopes of Klosters, earning a rebuke from Prince Charles.

A few months later, at Royal Ascot, the duo were photographed prodding the rear of a friend with their rolled umbrellas.

The watching world chorused its disapproval.

'Far too much frivolity,' sniffed one newspaper, while other commentators accused the women of behaving like actresses in a soap opera.

The Duchess of York was singled out for the most criticism — namely for her poor judgment, bad dress sense and blatant freeloading.

But Diana was quickly forgiven any Fergie-inspired daftness after she shook hands, ungloved, with an Aids patient in April 1987 — an act that resulted in international headlines and widespread approval.

When it emerged that the Queen and her advisers had counselled caution, her 'courage' won her yet more plaudits.

Diana, it was felt, was different from other royals: in touch with modern realities, she truly seemed to care for the man and woman in the street.

Four years on, in 1991, the Queen realised she was now facing a full-scale royal rebellion.

One evening, during the annual royal holiday at Balmoral, Diana and Fergie had taken the Queen Mother's Daimler and a four-wheel-drive estate vehicle out for a spin and raced each other along the private roads.

On another occasion, they'd commandeered a quad bike and gone racing over the golf course, churning up the greens.

The two women were now secretly plotting to leave their marriages at the same time.

They even took it in turns to bend their mother-in-law's ear about their marital problems — 'the kind of chats,' according to a former servant, 'the Queen had come to dread'.

Diana was then having an affair with Major James Hewitt, while Fergie was sleeping with Steve Wyatt, the adopted son of a Texan oil tycoon, while five months pregnant with Princess Eugenie.

During their relationship, she'd arranged for the head of Iraq's State Oil Marketing Organisation to pay a private visit to Buckingham Palace — sometime between Iraq's invasion of Kuwait and the start of the first Gulf War.

There he enjoyed dinner with the duchess and her American lover, whose family had continuing business ties with Saddam Hussein's regime.

Once the Queen learned of her imprudent behaviour, Fergie was summoned by the Queen's private secretary, Sir Robert Fellowes, for a formal dressing-down.

'You have abused Her Majesty and her kindness,' he told her, emphasising that he had the Monarch's full authority to speak to her in this manner.

The following Sunday, Fergie asked her mother-in-law why she'd been given such a tongue-lashing.

Rather than confront the Duchess of York, the Queen feigned ignorance.

Her inability to face down members of her extended family, even when they were demonstrably in the wrong, quietly enraged her senior officials.

Next, it transpired that Fergie's lover had also embarked on a relationship with the polo-playing businesswoman Lesley Player, who also happened to be the mistress of Fergie's own father, Major Ronald Ferguson.

Shortly afterwards, Fergie began another affair with Wyatt's friend and financial adviser, John Bryan.

With her marriage now firmly on the rocks, she consoled herself with the thought that Diana would be leaving the royal fold at the same time.

The Princess, however, had other ideas.

Unbeknown to Fergie, Diana was secretly working with me — via an intermediary — on a no-holds-barred biography of her life in which she openly discussed her eating disorder, her half-hearted suicide attempts and her husband's adultery.

She was continuing to complain to the Queen about Charles's behaviour.

What she really wanted was for her own conduct to be ignored, and for her mother-in-law to condemn her son for his infidelity with Camilla.

At these numerous encounters with Diana, the Queen found it difficult to deal with her tears and tantrums.

She did, however, concede that the direction of Charles's life was unfocused, and that his behaviour could be odd and erratic.

In January 1992, Fergie and Andrew made a formal appointment with the Queen to discuss their failed five-year marriage.

Somewhat reluctantly, the Monarch read the pair the riot act and convinced them to give their marriage another six months.

They agreed — in part, Fergie reflected later, because they'd never seen her looking so sad.

Unfortunately, Her Majesty's desire for a reconciliation was thwarted within weeks when photographs were published of the duchess on holiday with her lover Steve Wyatt.

For his part, Prince Philip made it clear he never wanted to be in the same room as Fergie again.

In late March, Diana's father Earl Spencer died suddenly following a heart attack while she was on a skiing holiday in Austria with Charles and their sons.

When told about his death, the Princess refused to return home alongside her husband, saying that she didn't want to go through a hypocritical masquerade.

She relented only after the Queen, in a phone call from Windsor, insisted that the couple put on a united front.

The dam burst in June 1992 with the publication of my book, Diana: Her True Story.

When it was first serialised — under the front-page headline 'Diana driven to five suicide bids by 'uncaring' Charles' — the response was explosive.

Diana refused to put her name to a palace statement denouncing the book as inaccurate and distorted.

Fergie recalled that the Queen's anger had 'wounded me to the core' (Pictured) Diana Princess of Wales and Sarah Duchess of York attend Royal Ascot on June 18, 1987

Yet at the same time she lied to the Queen's private secretary, denying she'd had anything to do with it.

As far as the Queen was concerned, this marriage could not conceivably end in the divorce courts — so she steeled herself for a meeting at Windsor with Diana and Charles.

It was difficult and tetchy.

The Queen insisted the Waleses should give their marriage more time and make a real effort to resolve their differences.

Privately, though, Charles and Diana had already agreed to separate — so the Princess was horrified when her husband agreed to his mother's proposal.

Fergie was next in the firing line.

'The redhead's in trouble,' Diana texted a friend on his pager messenger.

The 'trouble' in question involved some long-range paparazzi pictures of a topless Duchess of York having her toes sucked by her 'financial adviser', John Bryan, while her daughters looked on.

The story broke while Fergie — now formally separated from Andrew — was at Balmoral to discuss access arrangements for the children.

As she came down for breakfast, the rest of the Royal Family were studiously examining the tabloid story at the table.

It was a moment of excruciating embarrassment, even by her own standards.

As she recalled in her autobiography: 'It would be accurate to report that the porridge was getting cold . . . I had been exposed for what I truly was. Worthless. Unfit. A national disgrace.'

Furious, her mother-in-law summoned her up to her sitting room.

It hardly mattered that Andrew and his wife had separated; what concerned the Queen was that while Fergie still had a royal title, and the appellation 'Her Royal Highness', her behaviour was exposing the monarchy to contempt.

As she listed the duchess's transgressions and the damage she'd done to the institution, the Queen's tone was ice-cold.

She was also deeply upset on behalf of her son, who, according to one person close to her, had been made 'to look such a cuckolded fool before the entire world'.

Fergie later recalled that the Queen's anger — so rarely expressed — had 'wounded me to the core'.

The almost weekly accumulation of family scandal severely jolted the Queen's equanimity.

One senior courtier at Balmoral described her as looking 'grey and ashen and completely flat. She looked so awful'.

Three days later, it was Diana's turn to face the music, with the publication of a tape recording of a conversation with long-time admirer James Gilbey on her mobile phone.

During the late-night chat, Gilbey affectionately referred to her as 'Squidgy', which led to this latest scandal being dubbed 'Squidgygate'.

In the surreptitiously taped conversation, Diana criticised Prince Charles as well as Fergie and the Queen Mother.

Her husband, she said, made her life 'real, real torture'.

She also complained that she wasn't properly appreciated by the Royal Family for her work on their behalf.

Though not as humiliating as the Fergie photos, the Squidgygate tape seriously compromised the Princess.

The next blow came when Diana declined to accompany her husband on the first ever royal visit to South Korea — even when her mother-in-law implored her to change her mind.

It was only after a concerted campaign by both the Queen and Prince Charles that she finally agreed to go.

She shouldn't have bothered: in South Korea, the royal couple were barely able to raise a smile between them and the tour was deemed a disaster.

During this tumultuous period, opinion polls revealed the general public's growing dissatisfaction with the monarchy.

At the same time, numerous Church figures castigated the Royal Family for failing to provide a healthy example of family life.

In the midst of this, Windsor Castle — the Queen's home for most of her life — caught fire, leaving her utterly devastated.

An irate phone call from Prince Charles capped off a miserable year.

He'd arranged a shooting party with friends at Sandringham, and William and Harry had been scheduled to join the group.

Diana, however, insisted on taking the boys to Windsor instead.

In a phone call, the Prince told his mother that this was the final straw.

Once again, she counselled patience, but Charles had reached the end of his tether.

He shouted down the line: 'Don't you realise she's mad, mad, mad?' and slammed down the phone.

Reluctantly, the Queen was coming to accept that a separation — the solution that Diana had been arguing in favour of for months — was the only workable way forward.

Diana was having an affair with Major James Hewitt, while Fergie was sleeping with Steve Wyatt, the adopted son of a Texan oil tycoon, while five months pregnant (pictured) Princess Diana presents Captain James Hewitt with the Captain and Subalterns Cup after he led his army polo team to victory at Tidworth in 1989

A clergyman who has known the Sovereign for years observed her mood at the time.

'She felt that things were slipping away from her, that so many horrible things were happening, and when would it end?

'In a sense, she was feeling that she was losing control. It was the cumulative weight of all the personal disasters.'

Days after the separation announcement, Diana made an appointment to see the Queen at Buckingham Palace.

On entering the Sovereign's suite, she burst into floods of tears, claiming that everyone was against her.

'The Queen didn't know what to do,' recalled a lady-in-waiting.

'She has always hated this kind of emotional confrontation and, frankly, has never had to deal with it before or since.'

Early the following year, it was Prince Charles's feet that were held to the flames.

'Just when we thought things couldn't get any worse . . .' the Queen is said to have remarked wearily.

In the so-called Camillagate tapes, the Prince and Camilla were recorded having a lovey-dovey chat, during which he talked of his desire to be a tampon inside his lover.

If they hadn't thought so before, the majority of the public now believed that Diana was a wronged wife.

For the next few years, the 'War of the Waleses' consumed the media and agitated the Queen.

Everyone tiptoed around Diana, concerned that the unpredictable Princess would further damage the already listing institution.

Much against the better judgment of her mother and sister, the Queen tried to keep the Princess within the fold, still quietly hopeful that Charles and his wife could effect a reconciliation.

Long after other members of the Royal Family had given up, she'd always lend a listening ear to the Princess, and remain concerned about her well-being.

Occasionally, she'd phone the Princess at Kensington Palace to check she was all right.

In late April 1993, still hoping for a truce in the Waleses's bitter feud, the Queen invited Diana to a state banquet in honour of the president of Portugal.

Charles was furious when he found out.

Even after the couple had been officially separated for 12 months, the Queen invited Diana to Sandringham for Christmas.

And she'd always clear her diary if there was a possibility of the Princess bringing William and Harry to see Gan-Gan, as the boys called her, for afternoon tea.

Such meetings were useful to Diana.

Insisting she'd never ask Charles for a divorce, she hoped the Queen would push Charles into initiating it.

But none of her entreaties dented the Monarch's view that time might eventually heal the marriage.

This stalemate was finally broken in November 1995, when Diana appeared on the BBC's Panorama programme, talking about her husband's adultery, her belief that he wasn't up to the 'top job' of King, and her own desire to be a 'queen of people's hearts'.

The Queen found the Princess's interview unforgivable. Diana had crossed a line — notably in challenging the Sovereign by speaking of herself as a 'queen' of hearts, and by articulating her doubts about Charles's fitness to be King.

For the sake of both the monarchy and the grandchildren, something had to be done.

The following month, the Queen sent Diana a handwritten note saying she'd consulted with the Archbishop of Canterbury, the Prime Minister and Charles — 'and we have decided that the best course for you is divorce'.

It was a decision that was long overdue.

In the end, the Queen's policy of prevarication had merely served to drag out a painful marital conflict and cause long-term harm to the Crown.

Kyle Rittenhouse, 17, was arrested on Wednesday at his home in Antioch, Illinois, some 20 miles from Kenosha, where riots over the shooting of Jacob Blake have been raging now for four nights. He is accused of killing two people at the protests on Tuesday night while trying to 'defend' the city.

Disturbing videos from Tuesday night's protests show Rittenhouse walking through the streets with an AR-15 before the shootings and appearing to surrender to cops after them.

He walked towards police vehicles with his hands in the air as other protesters yelled at the cops to arrest him, claiming he'd just shot two people.

Shockingly, the teenager was not arrested until the following day. Now, he is in custody and has been charged as an adult.

In January this year, Rittenhouse sat front row at a Trump rally in Des Moines, Iowa.

Police-obsessed gunman, Kyle Rittenhouse, 17, charged with murder of two BLM protesters during Kenosha riots sat front row at a Trump MAGA rally at Drake University in Des Moines, Iowa in January this year

Kyle Rittenhouse, 17, has been charged with first degree intentional homicide following the shooting death of two protesters in Kenosha on Tuesday. Social media photos show the teen had a strong admiration for law enforcement and guns

The teenager's arrest came hours after video footage emerged showing Rittenhouse walking up to police with his hands in the air and his semi-automatic rifle slung across his body just moments after the shooting. He was apparently allowed to walk by despite members of the crowd yelling for him to be arrested

Shortly before the attack, and armed with a rifle slung across his body, Rittenhouse told the reporter he was a certified EMT and explained he was patrolling the streets of Kenosha to provide medical attention to anyone who had been injured, as well as protecting businesses from looters

The young Trump fan also once participated in a youth public safety cadet program.

On Tuesday, shortly before Rittenhouse opened fire, he gave an interview to right-wing news outlet The Daily Caller.

Armed with a rifle slung across his body, the teen told the reporter he was a certified EMT and explained he was patrolling the streets of Kenosha to provide medical attention to anyone in need and was helping protect local businesses from looters and rioters.

'People are getting injured. Our job is to protect this business and part of my job is to also help people,' Rittenhouse said of his militia.

'If there's somebody hurt, I'm running into harm's way,' added Rittenhouse, who was seen earlier guarding a local car shop with a group of armed militia members.

'That's why I have my rifle because I can protect myself, obviously. I also have my medkit.'

He also claimed he had been 'de-escalating' a potentially violent situation earlier in the night, during which he and the rest of his vigilante crew ordered protesters to leave a church that they had targeted.

Much of Rittenhouse's Facebook is devoted to praising law enforcement, with references to Blue Lives Matter - the movement that supports police. He also previously participated in a youth public safety cadet program (right), according to social media

A TikTok account believed to belong to Rittenhouse shows he had attended a Trump rally in January this year. The account has since been suspended

Facebook removes 'Kenosha Guard' militia group with 3,000 members asking 'patriots to take up arms and defend our city tonight from the evil thugs' Facebook on Wednesday launched an investigation into a group called 'Kenosha Guard,' containing 3,000 members, after it had promoted an event encouraging armed civilians to take to the streets to defend the city on Tuesday. The militia group had hosted an event titled, 'Armed Citizens to Protect our Lives and Property', according to screen grabs obtained by The Verge. 'Any patriots willing to take up arms and defend our city tonight from the evil thugs?' the group said in a post. 'No doubt they are currently planning on the next part of the city to burn tonight.' In a statement to the website, Facebook confirmed it had deleted the group for violating its policy, but said it had not found any evidence linking Rittenhouse to the group or event. 'At this time, we have not found evidence on Facebook that suggests the shooter followed the Kenosha Guard Page or that he was invited on the Event Page they organized,' the company said. 'However, the Kenosha Guard Page and their Event Page violated our new policy addressing militia organizations and have been removed on that basis.' A member of the group also told The Verge it was unaware if the shooter 'was answering the Kenosha Guard Militia's call to arms.' 'Just like with the shooting of Jacob Blake, we need all the facts and evidence to come out before we make a judgement. God Bless and stay safe Kenosha!' the statement said. Advertisement

When asked if the outcome would have been different if police officers responded to the scene instead, Rittenhouse replied: 'I feel like there would be a lot more casualties and a lot more people injured.'

'So I think the police are fine where they're at and [should] let us run the medical, because EMS is not coming in', he continued. 'Us citizens, we need to help each other.'

In a press conference addressing the shooting, Kenosha County Sheriff David Beth told reporters it was possible the gunman was part of an armed militia that had earlier asked the department if they could become part of the police force to help protect the city. In Wisconsin, it is legal for people 18 and over to openly carry a gun without a license but it is not legal for anyone under 18 to own a gun.

Beth said: 'And I'm like, 'Oh, hell no.' What happened last night is the perfect reason why I wouldn't.'

The sheriff called it a 'scary thought' that untrained members of the public might ever be given the same duties or privileges as police.

'Oh, hell no. What a scary, scary thought that would be in my world,' he said.

But footage from the night shows police thanking a group of armed militia that Rittenhouse was a part of and giving them water.

'We appreciate you being here,' an officer was heard saying to the group over a loudspeaker.

The sheriff later defended officers by saying, 'Our deputies would toss water to anybody.'

Earlier in the evening, Rittenhouse invited the Daily Caller reporter to join him as he searched for people who needed medical assistance.

He was confronted by protesters who said he'd been threatening them with his gun.

As Rittenhouse approached the group to offer medical help, one man tells him: 'I remember you, you were telling us to get off the car [makes gun gesture] now you're talking about medical?'

Rittenhouse, who appeared stunned by the confrontation, quickly walks away from the man, ignoring his comments and continued to search for people in need of care down the street.

After the chaos on Tuesday night, a Facebook group called the Kenosha Guard popped up.

It quickly amassed 3,000 members and issued a call to 'patriots'.

'Any patriots willing to take up arms and defend our city tonight from the evil thugs?

'No doubt they are currently planning on the next part of the city to burn tonight,' it said.

The group was deleted by Facebook.

Much of Rittenhouse's Facebook was devoted to praising law enforcement.

In a photograph posted by his mother, Wendy Rittenhouse, he is wearing what appears to be a blue law enforcement uniform as well as the kind of brimmed hat that state troopers wear.

Records show that in January 2017 his mom claimed a classmate of her son's had been calling him 'dumb' and 'stupid' and threatening him as she sought an order of protection from police.

Kenosha Police Chief Dan Miskinis later appeared to blame protesters for being out past the dawn to dusk curfew.

'Everybody involved was out after the curfew. I'm not going to make a great deal of it, but the point is that the curfew is in place to protect,' he said.

'Had persons not been out in violation of that, perhaps the situation that unfolded would not have happened.'

Rittenhouse, identified in court papers as a lifeguard at a YMCA in Lindenhurst, Illinois, was assigned a public defender in Illinois for a hearing on Friday upon his extradition to Wisconsin.

Rittenhouse was among the volunteers spotted earlier on Tuesday cleaning graffiti from a high school near the Kenosha County Courthouse following another night of unrest in the city

As for how the gunman managed to slip away, Sheriff David Beth (pictured) described a chaotic, high-stress scene, with lots of radio traffic and people screaming, chanting and running - conditions he said can cause 'tunnel vision' among law officers

Cellphone videos from Tuesday night captured the horrifying violence. The footage emerged before Rittenhouse was identified or arrested.

They showed the gunman running away in the moments after the gunshots rang out and he could be heard saying: 'I've just killed somebody'.

Anthony Huber has been identified as one of the men who was shot dead during the protests on Tuesday night

Onlookers were filmed desperately trying to put pressure on the injured man's head wound with a t-shirt as they yelled: 'We've got to keep him alive' and 'put pressure, put pressure.'

It is not yet clear what happened in the lead up to the initial shooting but police fear it may have stemmed from a conflict at a gas station between 'self-styled militias' defending local businesses from looters.

Separate videos that captured the other two shootings showed a group of protesters tailing the gunman as he ran down the middle of the street. Someone in the crowd can be heard asking 'What did he do?' and another responds that the man had shot someone.

The videos show the gunman stumbling and falling in the street before one pursuer took a flying kick at him, while another appeared to strike him with a skateboard.

The gunman fired three of four shots from a seated position, hitting at least two people, including one who fell over clutching his chest and another who stumbled away putting pressure on his arm, according to the videos.

As the crowd scattered, the shooter stood up and continued walking down the street as police cars arrived.

Kyle Rittenhouse was arrested on Wednesday afternoon in his hometown of Antioch, Illinois and charged with first degree intentional homicide over the shooting death of two protesters in Kenosha, Wisconsin last night. He will be extradited for a hearing on Friday in Wisconsin - where anyone 17 and over is treated as an adult

The same man was seen walking the streets of Kenosha carrying his gun. This image is believed to have been taken earlier in the evening prior to the shootings. Police said they fear that the shooting stemmed from a conflict between 'self-styled militias' defending local businesses but they have not officially confirmed if the gunman was part of the militia group

Several civilians were carrying weapons during the protests on Tuesday night and the gunman (far left and right) was believed to have been guarding a local car shop at some point prior to the shootings, according to videos posted online. At one point, police drove by and offered the group water

Witness Sam Dirks, 22, from Milwaukee, said he had seen the suspected gunman earlier in the evening and he was yelling at some of the protesters.

'He was definitely very agitated. He was pacing around, just pointing his gun in general. Not necessarily at anyone specifically,' Dirks said.

Another witness, Julio Rosas, 24, said that when the gunman stumbled and fell, 'two people jumped onto him and there was a struggle for control of his rifle. At that point during the struggle, he just began to fire multiple rounds and that dispersed people near him.'

'The rifle was being jerked around in all directions while it was being fired,' Rosas said.

Another protester Devin Scott told the Chicago Tribune that he witnessed the initial shooting and helped provide aid to the victim shot in the head.

'We were all chanting 'Black lives matter' at the gas station and then we heard, boom, boom, and I told my friend, that´s not fireworks,' the 19-year-old said.

'And then this guy with this huge gun runs by us in the middle of the street and people are yelling, 'He shot someone! He shot someone!' And everyone is trying to fight the guy, chasing him and then he started shooting again.'

Scott said he rushed to help the injured man, saying: 'I was cradling him in my arms. I was trying to keep this kid alive and he wasn't moving or nothing. He was just laying there.

'I didn't know what to do and then this woman starts performing CPR. There was no pulse. I don't think he made it.'

In the wake of the killings, Wisconsin Gov. Tony Evers authorized 500 members of the National Guard to support local law enforcement around Kenosha, doubling the number of troops sent in. The governor's office said he working other states to bring in additional National Guard troops and law officers.

Before the gunfire erupted, police in riot gear fired rubber bullets, tear gas and flash-bang rounds to push back demonstrators who defied a dawn-to-dusk curfew and gathered outside a courthouse and adjacent park.

About 300 demonstrators defied the city's 8pm curfew again after Governor Tony Evers declared a state of emergency earlier following a night of violence and destruction that saw rioters set fire to businesses and vehicles across the city.

The shooting of Blake comes three months after the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis which sparked nationwide protests against police brutality and racism.

The Kenosha County Sheriff's Department also deployed at least four armored patrol vehicles fitted with roof turrets from which deputies fired tear gas canisters into the crowd, many of whom hurled water bottles, bricks, firecrackers and other objects back at police.

But there was no immediate sign of buildings or cars being set ablaze, as happened on Monday night.

Demonstrators, some of whom were wearing helmets and equipped with makeshift protective gear, were seen trying to storm a black iron fence that had been installed earlier to protect the court from rioters.

Meanwhile, officers dressed in riot gear stood guard behind the barrier, holding up shields as protesters shouted expletives and hurled bottles at them.

Footage from the scene also showed people throwing fireworks in the direction of cops as they ignored their orders to disperse.

In one video shared by a journalist on Twitter, one man was seen trying to set fire to an American flag before being deterred by pepperballs fired by police.

Kenosha County sheriffs deputies warned crowds over loud speaker that they were participating in an unlawful gathering while urging them to leave the area.

The crowd responded by chanting 'black lives matter', prompting police to fire rubber bullets.

Several military-style armored patrol vehicles were also called in and were seen maneuvering around the county courthouse, firing tear gas at the crowd.

About three hours after declaring the protest an unlawful assembly, authorities had managed to push Tuesday night's crowd out of the downtown park, with demonstrators scattering down streets.

The disturbances came hours after Governor Evers vowed to deploy additional National Guard troops in a bid to restore order in the town, while Blake's mother publicly appealed for calm during a press conference held outside the court.

On Tuesday, President Trump, who has consistently denounced the BLM protests that have rocked the country in recent months, urged Wisconsin officials to call in the National Guard to quell the unrest, despite troops already being on the ground.

'Governor should call in the National Guard in Wisconsin. It is ready, willing, and more than able. End problem FAST!' Trump tweeted.

White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows later revealed Governor Evers had turned down Trump's offer for federal assistance, the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported.

A spokeswoman for Evers told the paper: 'The governor informed them that we would be increasing Wisconsin National Guard support in Kenosha and therefore would not need federal assistance in response to protests but would welcome additional federal support and resources for our state's response to COVID-19.'

Blake, 29, a father of six, was struck from behind at point-blank range in a hail of bullets fired on Sunday by police who were following him with guns drawn as he walked away from officers to his car and opened a door to the vehicle.

Three of his young sons inside the automobile - aged three, five and eight - witnessed their father being gunned down, according to civil rights attorney Ben Crump, who represents the Blake family.

A bystander captured the encounter in video footage that immediately went viral, unleashing outrage over the latest in a long series of instances in which police have been accused of using indiscriminate lethal force against African Americans.

Blake, who had been attempting to break up a quarrel between two women, was struck by multiple gunshots fired at him, all by one officer.

Crump also revealed Blake was undergoing surgery for his injuries, adding that the bullets severed his spinal cord and shattered his vertebrae. Another attorney said there was also severe damage to organs.

'It's going to take a miracle for Jacob Blake Jr to ever walk again,' Crump said.

The legal team plans to file a civil lawsuit against the police department over the shooting. Police have not explained why Blake was shot.

At a news conference earlier in the day, Blake's parents expressed anguish over the shooting while decrying two previous nights of looting, vandalism and arson that overshadowed peaceful street protests.

'They shot my son seven times, seven times, like he didn't matter,' Jacobv Blake Sr said tearfully as he spoke to reporters alongside other family members and lawyers.

'But my son matters. He's a human being and he matters.'

Blake's mother, Julia Jackson, said the damage in Kenosha does not reflect what her family wants and that, if her son could see it, he would be 'very unpleased.'

His uncle, Justin Blake, told TMZ the family are already looking into therapy for Jacob's children after they witnessed his shooting. A GoFundMe for Blake and his family has already raised more than $1.7 million.

After a night during which protests devolved into unrest, Gov. Evers had called for calm Tuesday saying: 'We cannot allow the cycle of systemic racism and injustice to continue.'

'We also cannot continue going down this path of damage and destruction.'

The night before crowds destroyed dozens of buildings and set more than 30 fires in the southeastern Wisconsin city's downtown.

On Monday, heavily armed residents were also seen standing guard outside buildings and local shops in case they were targeted by rioters.

In footage shared online, a group of men were seen carrying rifles and wearing combat gear as they protect local shops. They denied they are part of a militia.

Officers in riot gear and on horseback amassed at the encampment where supporters of Jair Bolsonaro stationed themselves after the storming of the government buildings which saw the yellow and green-clad rioters unleash chaos in the democratic chambers.

The 1,200 arrested today were transported in dozens of buses to a police station, on top of the 400 arrested yesterday, after a top judge ordered mass detentions and a thorough investigation into the mayhem, which saw Congress, the presidential palace and the Supreme Court raided.

Among the damage, with windows smashed to smithereens, computers thrown out of windows and a police officer and horse beaten with clubs, a £1.25million painting by Di Cavalcanti in the Planalto Palace was slashed six times.

But as the supporters trying to reinstall him into power are rounded up and thrown behind bars after protesting for the military to oust his successor Lula, Bolsonaro himself remains out of the action in his Florida bolthole.

The former president has been spotted wandering around a vacation resort neighbourhood, rubbing shoulders with famous expats, and was even snapped tucking in to a box of KFC.

According to reports, the nationalist leader has been staying at the home of Jose Aldo, a retired Brazilian professional MMA fighter and UFC champion.

But back home, truckers calling on military intervention to oust Lula and reinstate him, held more protests through the night.

A toll road operator for the BR 163 highway that cuts through Brazil's top grain producing state Mato Grosso reported several blockades that were cleared by dawn. Police said blockages on another highway in Parana state were also cleared.

Supreme Court Justice Alexandre de Moraes ordered the governor of Brasilia removed from office late on Sunday for 90 days over alleged security failings and demanded that social media platforms Facebook, Twitter and TikTok block accounts of users spreading anti-democratic propaganda.

The occupation of the government buildings had been planned for at least two weeks by Bolsonaro's supporters in groups on messaging platforms such as Telegram and Twitter, yet there was no move by security forces to prevent the attack, called by one group 'the seizure of power by the people.'

The assault raised questions among Lula's allies about how security forces in the capital were so unprepared for rioters.

The hallowed seats of power in Brasilia are still bearing the scars of the unprecedented violence that broke out yesterday, with shards of glass, blood stains, furniture, government computers and files lying strewn across Congress, the presidential palace and the Supreme Court.

In the ugly scenes, police deployed tear gas, stun grenades and water cannons but were initially overwhelmed with the mayhem as protesters even beat a police officer to the ground off his horse and whacked both the cop and the animal with clubs.

Bolsonaro, branded the 'Trump of the Tropics' who lost the divisive October elections to the veteran leftist Lula da Silva, has rejected his successor's claims he incited the 'fascist' attack and defended the right to 'peaceful protests'.

Brazilian authorities vowed Monday to protect democracy and punish thousands of rioters who stormed and trashed the nation's highest seats of power

Thousands of supporters of Brazil's far-right ex-president Jair Bolsonaro broke through police barricades and stormed into Congress, the presidential palace and the Supreme Court

A sea of enraged rioters wearing the Brazilian football shirt and military-style camouflage descended on the Three Powers Square, invading the floor of Congress, trashing the Supreme Court building and climbing the ramp to the Planalto, hoping for the military to restore Bolsonaro or oust Lula.

The protesters broke doors and windows to enter Congress, then streamed inside en masse, trashing lawmakers' offices and using the sloped speaker's dais on the Senate floor as a slide as they shouted insults at absent lawmakers.

Protesters damaged artworks, historic objects, furniture and decorations as they ran riot through the buildings and hurled computers and printers to the ground, much like their US counterparts almost two years to the day.

They punctured a massive Emiliano Di Cavalcanti painting in five places, overturned the U-shaped table at which Supreme Court justices convene, ripped a door off one justice's office and vandalized an iconic statue outside the court. The monumental buildings' interiors were left in states of ruin.

Shocking footage also shows a police car tearing through the crowds at high speeds, as throngs of protesters flee screaming in terror.

Other scenes from the day's chaos included a clip of a demonstrator apparently defecating on a desk inside a government chamber, and scores of protestors being led out of the National Congress building in handcuffs after being arrested by police.

Lula was only inaugurated a week ago and he has already been forced to declare emergency powers and deploy the national guard after 40 buses were seized to transport protesters to the seats of power in Brasilia.

Bolsonaro, who is believed to be in Florida, has repeatedly refused to accept his election defeat.

'These fascist fanatics have done something never before seen in this country's history,' said Lula, 77. 'We will find out who these vandals are, and they will be brought down with the full force of the law.'

Lula returned to Brasilia and viewed the damage at the presidential palace and the Supreme Court. He said he would work out of the palace on Monday despite all the destruction.

Justice Minister Flávio Dino said the acts amounted to terrorism and coup-mongering and that authorities have begun tracking those who paid for the buses.

Rishi Sunak said today on Twitter: 'I condemn any attempt to undermine the peaceful transfer of power and the democratic will of the people of Brazil.'

He said President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva has the UK's 'full support'.

'I look forward to building on our countries' close ties in the years ahead,' he added.

Foreign Secretary James Cleverly called the scenes 'unjustifiable'.

US President Joe Biden also criticised the incidents, tweeting: 'I condemn the assault on democracy and on the peaceful transfer of power in Brazil.'

Pope Francis also condemned a 'weakening of democracy' in the Americas today, citing the Brazil riots, in his yearly New Year's address to ambassadors.

'In many areas, a sign of the weakening of democracy is heightened political and social polarisation, which does not help to resolve the urgent problems of citizens,' said Francis during his speech at the Vatican.

The Argentine pontiff cited 'various countries of the Americas where political crises are laden with tensions and forms of violence that exacerbate social conflicts'.

'I am thinking of these last few hours in Brazil,' he said, in a line that was not included in the pre-released text.

Supporters of Brazil's former President Jair Bolsonaro vandalize the interior of Planalto Palace during a demonstration

The uprising, which lasted a little over three hours, underlined the severe polarisation that still grips the country

Lula announced a federal security intervention in Brasilia lasting until January 31 after capital security forces were initially overwhelmed by the invaders

Protesters wore the green and yellow colors of the national flag that also have come to symbolize the nation's conservative movement and were adopted by Bolsonaro's supporters

TV images showed police ushering Bolsonaro supporters in single file down the ramp from the Planalto presidential palace - the same ramp Lula climbed a week earlier at his inauguration.

Police, who had established a security cordon around the square, fired tear gas in a bid to disperse the rioters - initially to no avail.

A journalists' union said at least five reporters were attacked, including an AFP photographer who was beaten by protesters and had his equipment stolen.

Hardline Bolsonaro supporters have been protesting outside army bases calling for a military intervention to stop Lula from taking power since his election win.

Lula's government vowed to find and arrest those who planned and financed the attacks.

Brasilia Governor Ibaneis Rocha fired the capital's public security chief, Anderson Torres, who previously served as Bolsonaro's justice minister.

The attorney general's office said it had asked the Supreme Court to issue arrest warrants for Torres 'and all other public officials responsible for acts and omissions' leading to the unrest.

It also asked the high court to authorize the use of 'all public security forces' to take back federal buildings and disperse anti-government protests nationwide.

Protester Sarah Lima told AFP they were demanding a review of the 'fraudulent election.'

Results from Brazil's election - the closest in over three decades - were quickly recognised by politicians across the spectrum, including some Bolsonaro allies, as well as dozens of governments.

Lula narrowly won the runoff by a score of 50.9 percent to 49.1 percent. Bolsonaro, who left for the US state of Florida on the second-to-last day of his term, has alleged he is the victim of a conspiracy against him by Brazil's courts and electoral authorities.

Brazilians have used electronic voting since 1996. Election security experts consider such systems less secure than hand-marked paper ballots because they leave no auditable paper trail.

Brazil's system is, however, closely scrutinized and domestic authorities and international observers have never found evidence of it being exploited to commit fraud.

Still, Bolsonaro's supporters refused to accept results in the past months. They have blocked roads and camped outside military buildings, urging the armed forces to intervene.

Protests were overwhelmingly peaceful, but isolated threats of terrorism - including a bomb found on a fuel truck headed to Brasilia's airport - had prompted security concerns.

Two days before Lula's Jan. 1 inauguration, Bolsonaro flew to the U.S. and took up temporary residence in Orlando.

Many Brazilians expressed relief that, while he declined to participate in the transition of power, his absence allowed it to occur without incident.

Or so it had been, until Sunday's havoc.

'Bolsonarism mimics the same strategies as Trumpism. Our Jan. 8 - an unprecedented manifestation in Brazilian politics - is clearly copied from Jan. 6 in the Capitol,' said Paulo Calmon, a political science professor at the University of Brasilia. 'Today's sad episodes represent yet another attempt to destabilize democracy and demonstrate that the authoritarian, populist radicalism of Brazil's extreme right remains active under the command of former President Bolsonaro, the `Trump of Latin America.''

U.S. President Joe Biden tweeted that the riots were an 'assault on democracy and on the peaceful transfer of power in Brazil,' and that he looked forward to continue working with Lula.

In a news conference from Sao Paulo state, Lula read a freshly signed decree for the federal government to assume control of security in the federal district.

He said that the so-called 'fascist fanatics,' as well as those who financed their activities, must be punished, and also accused Bolsonaro of encouraging their uprising.

Bolsonaro repudiated the president's accusation late Sunday. Writing on Twitter, he said peaceful protest is part of democracy, but vandalism and invasion of public buildings are 'exceptions to the rule.' He made no specific mention of the protesters' actions in Brasilia.

'He is evidently the intellectual mentor of what is happening, so he cannot dissociate from it,' said Mario Sérgio Lima, political analyst at Medley Advisors. 'These groups were created by him, by the radicalism he imposed on politics. There is no way to undo that. ... It seems his group has already crossed the Rubicon.'

Unlike the 2021 attack in the U.S., few officials would have been working in the top government buildings on a Sunday. And videos showed limited presence of the capital's military police.

That led many in Brazil to question whether the police had ignored abundant warnings, underestimated their abilities or had been somehow complicit.

'I'm here for history, for my daughters,' said Lima, 27, wearing the yellow jersey of the Brazilian national football team - a symbol Bolsonaro backers have claimed as their own - and protesting with her young twin daughters.

Fellow protester Rogerio Souza Marcos said the elections had been plagued by 'multiple signs of fraud and corruption.'

Newly installed Justice and Public Security Minister Flavio Dino called the invasion 'an absurd attempt to impose (the protesters') will by force.'

'It will not prevail,' he wrote on Twitter.

There was swift international condemnation of the protesters.

The United Nations said it 'vehemently condemns' the attacks.

US President Joe Biden slammed the scenes as 'outrageous,' European Council President Charles Michel tweeted his 'absolute condemnation,' and French President Emmanuel Macron called for respect for Brazil's institutions and sent Lula 'France's unwavering support.'

Even Italy's far-right Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni condemned the riots.

Earlier on Wednesday, it was reported that Adam Newbold, 45, of Lisbon, Ohio, told his Facebook followers in a now-deleted video that he was 'proud' of what happened at the Capitol last week.

It has since been revealed that Newbold, who traveled down to Washington, DC, with a group of people on the night of January 5, is a contractor for the Navy Warrior Challenge program based in Ohio and is listed as a regional 'mentor' on the site.

Newbold's contact information is also listed on the Navy Warrior Challenge website, but when DailyMail.com reached out for comment a person who answered quickly hung up.

Retired Navy SEAL, Adam Newbold, who boasted about the Capitol breach last week, prepares recruits for entry to the unit's arduous selection course in Ohio

Newbold, who traveled down to Washington, DC , with a group of people on the night of January 5, is a contractor for the Navy Warrior Challenge program based in Ohio and is listed as a regional 'mentor' on the site

In response to Newbold's claim that he isn't a traitor, retired Army Gen General Raymond A. Thomas III tweeted: '""I’m not a traitor."" Yeah, you are. And you are a stain on your former profession'

Navy spokeswoman Cmdr Courtney Hillson told Task & Purpose that the program helps potential SEAL trainees prepare for basic underwater demolition/SEAL training.

Newbold's bio says that he is 'a highly decorated combat veteran of multiple wars, conflicts, and countless Top Secret, Covert and Clandestine Operations'.

'He is a former special advisor to the director of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and has held counsel with the President of the United States, top military commanders, congressional leaders and foreign heads of state.

'His company, ATG, trains law enforcement professionals, government contractors, military special operators and federal agents in Advanced Tactics. ATG’s mission is to provide lifesaving skillsets to those who often find themselves in harm’s way. These skills are designed to keep operators safe and effective.'

According to Task & Purpose, Newbold also co-owns RAPTOR Training Services, which was awarded a contract by the Army in 2014 for nearly $98million to provide 'Special Operations Forces requirements analysis, prototyping, training, operations, and rehearsal and for operations and maintenance training support'.

Newbold, who has since apologized for 'getting wrapped up in the heat of the moment', was seen in a video, obtained by ABC News, telling his Facebook followers that he was 'proud' of what happened in DC while on his way home.

'There was destruction breaching the Capitol. To get in you had to destroy doors and windows,' Newbold, who is a retired reserve SEAL special warfare operator, says in the clip.

'I'm hoping the message was strong enough, unfortunately maybe it wasn't, I'd hate to see this escalate more,' he added in the since deleted video.

According to ABC, Newbold also said in the clip that he hopes 'it pans out to be a positive revolution'.

During the rant, Newbold, who served 24 years in the Navy, said he wanted to make lawmakers 'think twice about what they're doing' and to be left 'shaking in their shoes'.

In another video from Newbold's event page for the DC rally, he advised participants to consider bringing walking sticks to use as weapons to fend off Antifa protesters.

Shocking video from the riot on the Capitol showed Trump supporters using poles from their flags, as well as batons to assault police officers.

And just a day before the riot, Newbold shared a video on his Facebook page telling his viewers that they are 'very prepared' for a fight.

Just a day before the riot, Newbold (left and right) shared a video on his Facebook page telling his viewers that they are 'very prepared' for a fight. 'We are not going down looking for a fight... we are just very prepared, very capable and very skilled patriots ready for a fight,' he said

Newbold (pictured) expressed remorse for what happened at the Capitol, saying: 'It was all taken too far'

'It's time to stand up and take our country back and make sure that we are being respectful and doing things in the right way,' he said.

'We are not going down looking for a fight... we are just very prepared, very capable and very skilled patriots ready for a fight and we will react without hesitation when called upon to do so,' Newbold added.

But in an interview with ABC, Newbold started to sing a very different tune and revealed that he is now cooperating with FBI agents who will be conducting a second interview with him.

Newbold expressed remorse for what happened at the Capitol, saying: 'It was all taken too far.'

'I would like to express to you just a cry for clemency, as you understand that my life now has been absolutely turned upside-down,' Newbold said. 'I am not a terrorist. I am not a traitor.'

But retired Army Gen General Raymond A. Thomas III, the former head of US Special Operations Command, believes otherwise.

'""I’m not a traitor."" Yeah, you are. And you are a stain on your former profession,' Thomas tweeted.

In a video shared on the ATG Worldwide Facebook page, Newbold said that 'people standing up for this country are not traitors'.

'Standing up for the government isn't a coup attempt. What I don't agree with is that some people were fighting with the cops,' Newbold said, adding that he was upset that protesters also brought pipe bombs and Molotov cocktails.

'We were constantly trying to deescalate and make sure to stand strongly with the police,' Newbold added.

Newbold said he didn't assault any of the officers as the mob of MAGA supporters stormed the building. He also said he never entered the Capitol building

Newbold told ABC that he didn't assault any of the officers as the mob of MAGA supporters stormed the building. He also said he never entered the Capitol building.

He said he came to a realization that the incident 'accomplished nothing' after learning that a rioter had been shot dead inside the building.

Capitol Police Officer, Brian Sicknick, also died from injuries he sustained during the riot and three other people succumbed to injuries from the incident.

'What the hell was it all for?' Newbold told ABC. 'Now I regret being in the crowd. When you are in the arena, you don't see the big picture.'

Refraining from discussing specifics concerning Newbold’s actions, Capt Ryan Perry, a spokesperson for Naval Special Warfare Command, said in a statement to ABC: 'It would be inappropriate to discuss the actions of an individual, whose reserve service ended almost four years ago, that are subject to an ongoing federal investigation.'

On Tuesday, the military's top leaders issued a written reminder to all service members that the deadly insurrection at the Capitol last week was an anti-democratic, criminal act, and that the right to free speech gives no-one the right to commit violence.

A memo signed by all members of the Joint Chiefs of Staff also reminded military members that Joe Biden was duly elected as the next president and will be sworn in to office on January 20.

The memo was unusual in that the military leadership, including Gen Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs, felt compelled to remind service members that it is wrong to disrupt the constitutional process.

'The violent riot... was as direct assault on the US Congress, the Capitol building, and our Constitutional process,' said a memorandum signed by all eight members of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, led by the chairman, Milley.

It came as law enforcement agencies attempt to determine the full extent of criminal activity at the Capitol and to discover the extent of participation by current or past military members.

Five people during the riots, including US Capitol officer Brian Sicknick

Among the known retired veterans who stormed the Capitol was Ashli Babbitt, a retired Air Force veteran, who was shot dead by an officer as she tried to climb through a broken window to breach the chamber.

Retired Lt Col Larry Rendall Brock Jr, 53, was slapped with federal charges after he was pictured carrying plastic handcuffs and wearing full military gear in the Senate chamber during the riot.

The Army is also investigating Captain Emily Rainey for leading a group of at least 100 people from North Carolina to the rally.

She defended her actions saying she acted 'within military regulations' and no one within her group broke the law.

'The rights of freedom of speech and assembly do not give anyone the right to resort to violence, sedition and insurrection,' they said.

The letter said members of the armed services are bound to defend the constitution.

'Any act to disrupt the constitutional process is not only against our traditions, values and oath; it is against the law.'

15 Sept 2024 16.00 BST Closing summary The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) confirmed publicly on Tuesday that three Israeli hostages were mistakenly killed in a strike that also took the life of Hamas’ northern Gaza brigade chief, Ahmed Ghandour, in November. According to reports from Hebrew media, families of Sgt. Ron Sherman, Cpl. Nik Beizer, both 19, and civilian Elia Toledano, 28, who were abducted by Hamas on 7 October, were informed by IDF officials that their loved ones had tragically lost their lives as a result of IDF actions after a comprehensive inquiry.

Israel is allegedly recruiting asylum seekers from Africa to take part in military operations in Gaza in exchange for residency rights, according to an investigation by Israel’s daily newspaper Haaretz. According to the report, based on testimonies of asylum seekers and defence officials, speaking off-the-record, Israel’s defence establishment is “offering African asylum seekers who contribute to the war effort in Gaza assistance in obtaining permanent status in Israel”.

Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu will travel to New York on 24 September, the first day of the high-level general debate by world leaders at the annual UN general assembly, his office said Sunday. It said Netanyahu is scheduled to stay until 28 September in the US, which he had visited in July for official talks and a congressional address.

A sniper killed a UN worker on the roof of his home in the northern West Bank, the UN has said, as friends and family gathered in Turkey to bury a US-Turkish activist who had been killed by the Israeli military at a protest six days earlier and around 30km away. Sufyan Jaber Abed Jawwad, a sanitation worker with the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, was the first Unrwa employee killed in the West Bank in more than a decade. Shot in the early hours of Thursday morning in el Far’a camp, he left behind a wife and five children.

A missile fired at central Israel from Yemen hit an unpopulated area, causing no injuries according to Israel’s military on Sunday, Reuters reports. Moments earlier, air raid sirens had sounded in Tel Aviv and across central Israel, sending residents running for shelter. “Following the sirens that sounded a short while ago in central Israel, a surface-to-surface missile was identified crossing into central Israel from the east and fell in an open area. No injuries were reported,” the military said.

Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Sunday that the Houthis in Yemen should have known that Israel would exact a heavy price after an attack on Israeli soil. At a weekly cabinet meeting, Netanyahu also said that the current situation in northern Israel “will not continue,” and that he was determined to do everything possible to return northern evacuees to their homes.

Yemen’s Houthis claimed responsibility for a ballistic missile attack that reached central Israel for the first time on Sunday. “It forced more than two million Zionists to run to shelters for the first time in the enemy’s history,” the military spokesperson for the Houthis said in a statement.

Hezbollah’s second-in-command warned on Saturday that an all-out war by Israel aimed at returning 100,000 displaced people to their homes in areas near the Lebanon border would displace “hundreds of thousands” more, AFP reports. Naim Qassem, number two in the Iran-backed Lebanese group, was speaking after defence minister Yoav Gallant said Israel was determined to restore security to its northern front.

At least 41,206 Palestinians have been killed and 95,337 others injured in Israel’s military offensive on Gaza since 7 October , the health ministry in Gaza said on Sunday.

Thousands of people again took to the streets of Israel’s main cities on Saturday in a bid to increase pressure on the government to secure the release of hostages in Gaza, AFP reports. Weekly rallies have sought to keep up pressure on the Israeli government, accused by critics of stalling on a deal to free the remaining hostages.

Mourners gathered in the Aegean town of Didim, south-west Turkey, on Saturday for the funeral of a US-Turkish activist, who was shot dead while protesting Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank. The killing last week of 26-year-old Aysenur Ezgi Eygi has sparked international condemnation and angered Turkey, further escalating tensions over the war in Gaza. A large crowd gathered during the prayers including Eygi’s family, members of president Recep Tayyip Erdoğan’s Islamic-rooted AKP party, and activists advocating the Palestinian cause. Erdoğan has vowed to ensure “that Aysenur Ezgi’s death does not go unpunished”. The Israeli military has said it was likely Eygi was hit “unintentionally” by forces while they were responding to a “violent riot”, and said it is looking into the case.

Israeli airstrikes hit central and southern Gaza overnight into Saturday, killing at least 14 people, Gaza’s civil defence agency said. “We have recovered the bodies of 11 martyrs, including four children and three women, after an Israeli airstrike hit the house of the Bustan family in eastern Gaza City,” agency spokesperson Mahmud Bassal told Agence France-Presse (AFP). The strike took place near the Shujaiya school in the al-Tuffah neighbourhood of Gaza City, he said. The Israeli military had no immediate comment on the strike.

Bassal said Israeli forces carried out similar strikes in some other parts of the territory overnight, killing at least 10 people. Five people were killed in northwestern Gaza City when an airstrike hit a group of people near Dar Al-Arqam school, he said. Three others were killed in a strike in the al-Mawasi area of the southern Khan Younis governorate, where tens of thousands of displaced Palestinians have sought refuge, Bassal added.

At least 41,182 Palestinians have been killed and 95,280 others injured in Israel’s military offensive on Gaza since 7 October, Gaza’s health ministry said on Saturday. The toll includes 64 deaths in the previous 48 hours, according to the ministry, which does not distinguish between civilians and militants in its count.

The Palestine Red Crescent Society (PRCS) disaster risk management teams, in cooperation with the Palestine Ministry of Social Development, distributed food parcels to 11,000 families in Gaza and North Gaza governantes , the humanitarian organisation shared on X.

Richard Peeperkorn, the World Health Organization’s (WHO) representative in Gaza and the West Bank, said in a statement on Saturday that he is “hopeful these pauses will hold” as the UN agency prepare for the next round of polio vaccinations in Gaza in four week’s time. About 559,000 children under the age of 10 have recovered from their first dose, the WHO said, as part of a campaign to inoculate children in Gaza. The second doses are expected to begin later this month as part of an effort in which the WHO said parties had already agreed to.

On Sunday, the IDF said: “The findings of the investigation suggest that the three, with high probability, were killed by a byproduct of an IDF airstrike, during the assassination” of Ghandour. “This is a highly probable estimate given all the data, but it is not possible to determine with certainty the circumstances of their death,” the military says.

15 Sept 2024 14.14 BST Bethan McKernan Every evening, for two hours, Asma Mustafa sits down with the small children of Nuseirat camp in central Gaza for what now passes as school in the beleaguered strip. She makes do with what is available: sometimes there are pens and paper for basic maths and literacy, but most of the time class time is taken up with storytelling, singing and play. “I have been doing this since November,” said Mustafa, 38, who taught at a girl’s high school in Gaza City before the war. “Many children are now working or helping their families find basic things like food during the day, but I try to give them a little bit of structure and normality in the evenings.” Last week was supposed to mark the beginning of the new school year in Palestine, but in Gaza 625,000 school-age children are now entering a second year in which they have been denied the right to education because of the Israel-Hamas war. More than 45,000 six-year-olds were due to start school this year. In the 11 months since Hamas’s 7 October attack on Israel, almost all of Gaza’s population of 2.3 million have been displaced from their homes, and some of the strip’s schools have become shelters – but about 90% of Gaza’s 307 public school buildings and all 12 universities have been damaged or destroyed in Israeli attacks, according to the Education Cluster, a collection of aid groups led by Unicef and Save the Children. ‘The war has stolen our future’: Gaza children begin second school year without education Read more Share

15 Sept 2024 13.47 BST Lorenzo Tondo Yemen’s Houthi rebels have claimed responsibility for a surface-to-surface ballistic missile that landed a few miles south-east of Ben Gurion airport in Tel Aviv on Sunday morning as the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, warned the group it would pay a “heavy price”. The missile triggered air sirens across the country at about 6.30am, with local media airing footage of people racing to shelters at the international airport. According to reports, the missile hit an open area in the Ben Shemen forest, sparking a fire near Kfar Daniel. There were no reports of casualties or damage. The Israeli military is investigating if the fire was the result of falling fragments due to the interceptor missiles launched at the projectile, or if the rocket had actually penetrated Israeli air defences as the Houthis have claimed, saying the group had used a hypersonic missile for the first time. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said they made several attempts to intercept the missile using their multi-tiered air defences but had not yet determined whether any had been successful. “An initial inquiry indicates the missile most likely fragmented in mid-air,” the IDF said, with “several interception attempts made by the Arrow and Iron Dome aerial defence systems”. It added that “the entire incident is under review”. Netanyahu tells Houthis they will pay ‘heavy price’ as missile hits Israel Read more Share

According to the report, based on testimonies of asylum seekers and defence officials, speaking off-the-record, Israel’s defence establishment is “offering African asylum seekers who contribute to the war effort in Gaza assistance in obtaining permanent status in Israel”. Haaretz reported that the programme was being carried out in an “organised manner” under the supervision of “defence establishment” legal advisers. Sources who spoke with Haaretz said: “While there were some inquiries about granting status to asylum seekers who assisted in the fighting, none were actually given status. At the same time, the defence establishment sought to provide status to others who contributed to combat efforts.” Contacted by the Guardian, the IDF did not immediately respond to a request for comment, citing it is still reviewing and “checking” the allegations.

15 Sept 2024 12.48 BST Benjamin Netanyahu said the Houthis should expect a “heavy price” for the missile attack on Israel. “Whoever needs a reminder of that is invited to visit the Hodeida port,” Netanyahu said, referring to an Israeli retaliatory airstrike against Yemen in July for a Houthi drone that hit Tel Aviv. The Houthis have fired missiles and drones at Israel repeatedly in what they say is solidarity with the Palestinians, since the Gaza war began with a Hamas attack on Israel in October. The drone that hit Tel Aviv for the first time in July killed a man and wounded four people. Israeli airstrikes in response on Houthi military targets near the port of Hodeidah killed six and wounded 80. Previously, Houthi missiles have not penetrated deep into Israeli airspace, with the only one reported to have hit Israeli territory falling in an open area near the Red Sea port of Eilat in March. Israel should expect more strikes in the future “as we approach the first anniversary of the 7 October operation, including responding to its aggression on the city of Hodeidah,” Sarea said. The deputy head of the Houthi’s media office, Nasruddin Amer, said in a post on X on Sunday that the missile had reached Israel after “20 missiles failed to intercept” it, describing it as the “beginning”. The Israeli military also said that 40 projectiles were fired towards Israel from Lebanon on Sunday and were either intercepted or landed in open areas. “No injuries were reported,” the military said.

15 Sept 2024 12.33 BST In an update to our earlier report on a missile fired from Yemen landing in Israel, the missile triggered air raid sirens at Israel’s international airport. Israel hinted that it would respond militarily.



There were no reports of casualties or major damage, but Israeli media aired footage showing people racing to shelters in Ben Gurion international airport. The airport authority said it resumed normal operations shortly thereafter.



A fire could be seen in a rural area of central Israel, and local media showed images of what appeared to be a fragment from an interceptor that landed on an escalator in a train station in the central town of Modiin.



The Israeli military said it made several attempts to intercept the missile using its multitiered air defences but had not yet determined whether any had been successful. It said the missile appeared to have fragmented mid-air, and that the incident is still under review. The military said the sound of explosions in the area came from interceptors.



The Yemeni rebels, known as Houthis, have repeatedly fired drones and missiles toward Israel since the start of the war in Gaza between Israel and the Palestinian militant group Hamas, but nearly all of them have been intercepted over the Red Sea. Share

Moments earlier, air raid sirens had sounded in Tel Aviv and across central Israel, sending residents running for shelter. “Following the sirens that sounded a short while ago in central Israel, a surface-to-surface missile was identified crossing into central Israel from the east and fell in an open area. No injuries were reported,” the military said.

Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Sunday that the Houthis in Yemen should have known that Israel would exact a heavy price after an attack on Israeli soil. At a weekly cabinet meeting, Netanyahu also said that the current situation in northern Israel “will not continue,” and that he was determined to do everything possible to return northern evacuees to their homes.

Yemen’s Houthis claimed responsibility for a ballistic missile attack that reached central Israel for the first time on Sunday. “It forced more than two million Zionists to run to shelters for the first time in the enemy’s history,” the military spokesperson for the Houthis said in a statement.

Hezbollah’s second-in-command warned on Saturday that an all-out war by Israel aimed at returning 100,000 displaced people to their homes in areas near the Lebanon border would displace “hundreds of thousands” more, AFP reports. Naim Qassem, number two in the Iran-backed Lebanese group, was speaking after defence minister Yoav Gallant said Israel was determined to restore security to its northern front.

At least 41,206 Palestinians have been killed and 95,337 others injured in Israel’s military offensive on Gaza since 7 October , the health ministry in Gaza said on Sunday.

Thousands of people again took to the streets of Israel’s main cities on Saturday in a bid to increase pressure on the government to secure the release of hostages in Gaza, AFP reports. Weekly rallies have sought to keep up pressure on the Israeli government, accused by critics of stalling on a deal to free the remaining hostages.

Mourners gathered in the Aegean town of Didim, south-west Turkey, on Saturday for the funeral of a US-Turkish activist, who was shot dead while protesting Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank. The killing last week of 26-year-old Aysenur Ezgi Eygi has sparked international condemnation and angered Turkey, further escalating tensions over the war in Gaza. A large crowd gathered during the prayers including Eygi’s family, members of president Recep Tayyip Erdoğan’s Islamic-rooted AKP party, and activists advocating the Palestinian cause. Erdoğan has vowed to ensure “that Aysenur Ezgi’s death does not go unpunished”. The Israeli military has said it was likely Eygi was hit “unintentionally” by forces while they were responding to a “violent riot”, and said it is looking into the case.

Israeli airstrikes hit central and southern Gaza overnight into Saturday, killing at least 14 people, Gaza’s civil defence agency said. “We have recovered the bodies of 11 martyrs, including four children and three women, after an Israeli airstrike hit the house of the Bustan family in eastern Gaza City,” agency spokesperson Mahmud Bassal told Agence France-Presse (AFP). The strike took place near the Shujaiya school in the al-Tuffah neighbourhood of Gaza City, he said. The Israeli military had no immediate comment on the strike.

Bassal said Israeli forces carried out similar strikes in some other parts of the territory overnight, killing at least 10 people. Five people were killed in northwestern Gaza City when an airstrike hit a group of people near Dar Al-Arqam school, he said. Three others were killed in a strike in the al-Mawasi area of the southern Khan Younis governorate, where tens of thousands of displaced Palestinians have sought refuge, Bassal added.

At least 41,182 Palestinians have been killed and 95,280 others injured in Israel’s military offensive on Gaza since 7 October, Gaza’s health ministry said on Saturday. The toll includes 64 deaths in the previous 48 hours, according to the ministry, which does not distinguish between civilians and militants in its count.

The Palestine Red Crescent Society (PRCS) disaster risk management teams, in cooperation with the Palestine Ministry of Social Development, distributed food parcels to 11,000 families in Gaza and North Gaza governantes , the humanitarian organisation shared on X.

Richard Peeperkorn, the World Health Organization’s (WHO) representative in Gaza and the West Bank, said in a statement on Saturday that he is “hopeful these pauses will hold” as the UN agency prepare for the next round of polio vaccinations in Gaza in four week’s time. About 559,000 children under the age of 10 have recovered from their first dose, the WHO said, as part of a campaign to inoculate children in Gaza. The second doses are expected to begin later this month as part of an effort in which the WHO said parties had already agreed to.

A new attempt has begun to try to salvage an oil tanker burning in the Red Sea after attacks by Yemen’s Houthi rebels, an EU naval mission said on Saturday. The EU’s Operation Aspides published images dated Saturday of its vessels escorting ships heading to the Greek-flagged oil tanker Sounion. Share

Officials sounded confident about their preparations even as they acknowledged receiving threats of violence and warnings against specific members of Congress.

'The US Capitol Police Department has been working around the clock for the last several weeks to ensure that we have a safe event tomorrow,' USCP Police Chief Tom Manager said during a press conference on Capitol Hill.

USCP Police Chief Tom Manager said his officers were ready for Saturday's 'Justice for J6' rally and said there would be no repeat of January 6th

'But perhaps more importantly, over the last eight months, the leadership of the US Capitol Police Department has been preparing working to ensure that we don't have a repeat of January 6,' he added.

Nearly 700 Trump supporters and far-right activists are expected on the West lawn of the Capitol on Saturday. They are protesting the federal charges that nearly 600 January 6th participants are facing for storming the Capitol, committing violence against the police, and causing destruction in the building.

USCP officers outlined the preparations they took to be ready for the rally even as they declined to go into details as not to reveal any sensitive security information.

The intent was to instill a sense of confidence and security going into the event. Officials are determined not to repeat the intelligence and planning mistakes revealed in the aftermath of the January 6th insurrection.

Manager admitted his biggest worry for Saturday was a clash between those attending the rally and any counter protesters who may attend.

Washington D.C. is hosting its popular H Street Festival on Saturday, which takes place a few miles from the Capitol Building, leading to concerns about potential street clashes.

'What we're concerned about, I think more than anything, is the possibility of counter demonstrators and making it to this demonstration, and they're being violence between those two groups,' Manager said. 'In my opinion, that's the most likely scenario for violence.'

He said their intelligence indicated three different groups - one of whom had a history of clashes - were talking of attending. He did not specify the groups.

Ahead of Saturday's rally, Capitol Hill has turned into a fortress with security fencing back up around the perimeter; signs warn the area around the Capitol is closed

Around 700 people are expected for Saturday's rally, which is to protest the federal charges against those who stormed the Capitol on January 6

Meanwhile, the Associated Press reported that a Department of Homeland Security intelligence report warned of social media posts that discussed the possibly of storming the Capitol Friday night. One user also 'commented on kidnapping an identified member of Congress,' the document said, though the lawmaker wasn't identified by name in the report.

Manager declined to comment on the report.

'Other references to violence identified on social media include discussions of using the rally to target local Jewish institutions, elected officials, and `liberal churches,'' the document said.

Lawmakers won't be in the Capitol building on Saturday but USCP has briefed Congressional leadership in the lead up to the rally.

Manager admitted threats to individual members of Congress have increased in recent days. Lawmakers are not scheduled to return to Washington DC until the week of September 20th.

'We have just, in the last few days, we've had a number of threats - specific threats - come in against specific members of Congress. And so we were going to handle those the same way we always handle those. And there's nothing different about the way we're going to deal with those, because of the rally tomorrow,' he said.

Additionally, House Sergeant at Arms William Walker, in a notice to members of Congress this week, urged lawmakers to stay away from the Capitol complex on Saturday and reminded them that security is available if they were traveling or had protests in their districts.

Ahead of Saturday's rally, Capitol Hill has turned into a fortress. Security fencing is back up around the perimeter, riot shields are ready, the National Guard is on stand by and DC Metro Police will activate their entire force on Saturday.

Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin has approved 100 National Guardsmen to be on standby at the DC Armory for support on Saturday if they are needed. They won't be armed but will be equipped with batons and protective vests for self-defense.

Manager wouldn't give an indication of how seriously they are taking threats of violence.

'It's tough to say whether they're credible or not it,' he said of the threats. 'We don't know with any certainty.'

He added: 'We're not taking any chances.'

The capitol police force and its partners in the region - including the DC National Guard and DC Metro Police - have held multiple exercises, including physical ones and table top drills, to prepare for Saturday, according to Sean Gallagher, an assistant chief for USCP.

'Our officers are ready,' he said. 'We are hoping and expecting a peaceful event this weekend, but our operational plan is scalable, so that we will be ready to handle anything that occurs.'

But the organizer of the rally, a former Trump campaign operative, said it would be a peaceful event.

Matt Braynard, who is also the executive director of Look Ahead America, said the intent was to draw attention to the Trump supporters facing federal charges for their role on January 6th.

'We look forward to having a very safe, peaceful expression of our First Amendment rights,' he said Friday morning on C-SPAN's 'Washington Journal.'

He noted 'there's no intent for violence on our side.'

He also said he's hired private security for rally.

'Yes a diplomatic security team but they're looped in with the Capitol Police Department and many of them are themselves, you know, ex cops,' he said.

Manager said they've had 'courtesy' conversations with rally organizers and he was aware they hired private security.

Braynard said his private security team would not be armed.

He also said he's asking attendees to film any encounters they have at the rally.

'I believe it's my responsibility to do everything I can do to keep every one of our attendees safe and to do that, we're asking when people leave to leave in large groups, we're asking for people to, if you see anything at all suspicious to somebody acting oddly - look we've all got television studios, right here in our pocket, whip it out and start recording,' he said.

Republicans are distancing themselves from the event. No GOP lawmaker is scheduled to speak and only two Republican House candidates are on the agenda.

Far right extremist groups like the Proud Boys and Oath Keepers are planning to attend. Members of those groups were among those who stormed the Capitol on January 6th and face some of the toughest federal charges as a result.

Intelligence officials told CBS News they are worried about individual fights breaking out or 'lone wolf'-style violence or individual 'knuckleheads' using the gathering to cause trouble.

The FBI is monitoring chatter on social media sites and message boards, including Telegram, Parler and Gab.

The January 6th riot resulted in five dead. Four police officers working that day committed suicide and more than 100 police officers were injured. The rioters did more than $1 million in damage to the Capitol.

Braynard said he organized Saturday's 'Justice for J6' rally to draw attention to the federal charges that almost 600 MAGA supporters who stormed the Capitol are facing. He called them 'political prisoners.'

He is part of a group of Trump supporters attempting to rewrite the narrative of the violence and panic of January 6th. Braynard argued during his C-SPAN appearance the MAGA protesters merely visited the Capitol on that day, walking between the security ropes. Video footage from the day shows the violence committed against law enforcement and the destruction in the building.

‘We've condemned all violence. We think that anybody that committed violence against police officers or destroy property at the Capitol Building on January 6 should be given a speedy trial,' Braynard said, even as he argued the protesters didn't do such things.

At least 30 people from January 6th are jailed in Washington. The rest are in facilities across the country.

Braynard argued the January 6 rioters are being treated much more harshly than other protesters, particularly those arrested for championing progressive causes.

'There's a big disparity between the way those people are being treated and these people are being treated despite engage in exactly the same behavior and facing the same charges. It's not about what they did, but about what they believe and that's what makes them political prisoners,' he said.

Braynard previously said he asked attendees not to wear political t-shirts or carry signs for a particular political candidate.

Donald Trump defended the January 6th rioters being prosecuted for their storming of the Capitol building - above the former president speaking at a rally outside of the White House on the morning of January 6th

Meanwhile, Donald Trump warned that Saturday's rally is a 'setup'.

'On Saturday, that's a setup,' Trump told the Federalist. 'If people don't show up they'll say, 'Oh, it's a lack of spirit.' And if people do show up they'll be harassed.'

His comments come after he defended the January 6th rioters being prosecuted for their storming of the Capitol building, saying they were being 'persecuted so unfairly' for protesting the 'rigged presidential election.'

'Our hearts and minds are with the people being persecuted so unfairly relating to the January 6th protest concerning the Rigged Presidential Election. In addition to everything else, it has proven conclusively that we are a two-tiered system of justice. In the end, however, JUSTICE WILL PREVAIL!' Trump said in a statement on Thursday.

Trump has repeatedly and falsely claimed the 2020 election was stolen from him as a result of massive election fraud. He faced a second impeachment trial - and was acquitted - on charges he helped incite the January 6th riot.

He gave a fiery speech outside the White House on January 6th, shortly before his MAGA supporters stormed Capitol Hill.

But he's not taking the same steps in the lead up to Saturday's rally. The former president will spend the Saturday at a golf tournament at his Bedminster, N.J., club, the New York Times reported.",US Capitol Police say they are ready for 'Justice for J6' rally amid threats to lawmakers,1
https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/oct/03/racism-threats-and-home-invasions-candidates-face-abuse-on-new-zealands-campaign-trail,1,"One of New Zealand’s youngest political candidates, 21-year-old Hana-Rāwhiti Maipi-Clarke, has experienced more politically targeted abuse in the past week than many senior politicians have experienced in their entire careers.

The candidate for minor party Te Pāti Māori, has had her home broken into twice, her belongings and rubbish bins rifled through, a threatening letter left in her mailbox and a man turn up to her house in the early hours of the morning yelling racial slurs while trying to break down her fence.

In the same week, Labour candidate Angela Roberts was confronted by a member of the public who, she said, grabbed her shoulders, shook her and then slapped her face with both his hands.

Two weeks earlier, Labour’s MP for Northland, Willow-Jean Prime, said she experienced the worst racism of her career, after a crowd shouted and jeered at her for using Māori words during a candidate debate.

“When I said Aotearoa, the crowd shouted ‘it’s New Zealand’,” Prime said in a media conference, adding she was told to stop speaking “that language”.

“That is racism … and that is unacceptable,” she said, adding “what is really worrying is that they feel so emboldened that they can come out and say these things publicly.”

New Zealand enjoys relatively open access to its politicians, and historically election campaigns have been fairly safe. But abuse, threats and attacks have been ramping up as the 14 October election draws near, with women and Māori candidates being especially targeted.

Te Pāti Māori’s co-leader, Debbie Ngarewa-Packer, told the Guardian the party was no stranger to hate speech and online threats, but that the attacks directed towards their candidate, Maipi-Clarke, had crossed a line.

“It’s hard to pull the handbrake now on years of consistent messaging that is anti-Māori. It’s easy to excuse it as rhetoric but the reality is: abuse has been incited and it has manifested into an absolute violation.”

Christopher Luxon, leader of the centre-right National party, said on Monday its candidates had also faced threats, predominantly from gangs.

Candidates are being given instructions on how to cope with abuse as threats increase, says Rafael Gonzalez-Montero, the chief executive of Parliamentary Services, which is responsible for parliament security. “The landscape has changed compared to previous years and both the parliamentary service and the members are probably a little more vigilant,” he said.

Last year’s unprecedented occupation of parliament’s grounds by anti-vaccine protesters – which turned into a violent riot – has likely contributed to the change in tone this election, he added. “What we saw last year was more than a protest … and it was very, very difficult to deal with.”

‘Extreme views being emboldened’

In various speeches last week, Labour leader Chris Hipkins condemned the attacks on candidates. He took aim at National, as well as the libertarian-right-wing Act party and populist New Zealand First party, who look set to form a government based on current polling, for stirring up anti-Māori sentiment.

“I think there has been more racism and misogyny in this election than we have seen in previous elections,” he said. “There are clearly some parties that are deliberately trying to persecute minorities.”

“Christopher Luxon reiterated his commitment to abolishing the Māori Health Authority in favour of ‘one system for all’,” Hipkins said in a speech on Friday. “One liners like ‘one system for all’ [are] putting the narrative that Māori somehow are getting things that other New Zealanders aren’t. This approach plays on people’s fears – it’s not pretty and it’s wrong. It also ignores basic facts.”

Hipkins said Act’s policy to redefine the country’s founding document – the Treaty of Waitangi – would “undo decades of progress and legal precedent” between the crown and Māori.

Meanwhile, New Zealand First says it wants to crack down on “woke virtue signalling” , which includes getting rid of Māori names on government institutions and last month, its leader, Winston Peters, who is Māori, claimed Māori were not indigenous to New Zealand.

A group of Māori leaders have called for an end to end “race-baiting” for votes. In an open letter, the leaders, who include former politicians, academics, community leaders and representatives of the Kiingitanga (Māori King movement) said: “dog whistling and the outright public displays of racism from political candidates have increased to unacceptable levels”.

In a statement to the Guardian, Act party leader David Seymour said the party condemned any acts of abuse or violence on the campaign trail but said it was dangerous to politicise the attacks by placing blame on other party leaders.

“New Zealanders are sick of being accused of wrongdoing or racism for having a conversation on the constitutional future of the country, based on what the treaty actually says,” Seymour said.

But the tenor of his response to accusations of race-baiting was more charged online. In a social media post, Seymour accused Labour, Te Pāti Māori and “their allies” of being the “real racists” and, in another post said the current government had been “the most divisive in NZ history” for “going after landlords, farmers, business owners, the wealthy and the unvaccinated”.

New Zealand First has been contacted for comment.

Richard Shaw, politics professor at Massey University, says people are being emboldened, in part, because the internet allows for extreme views to be anonymously spit out at a speed and scale not seen before.

But Shaw also believes that some of New Zealand’s political parties are inflaming these views. “Parties like Act and, increasingly, New Zealand First, are perfectly happy to engage in … simple extremist views and racism,” Shaw said.

“They feel it is appropriate to do that because there is some twisted understanding of the nature of freedom of speech, which in the mouths of people who support solemn individualism, is about the right to say whatever you want without any regard for the consequences for other people.

“It’s a bastardised, juvenile and immature approach to the politics of the logic of freedom of speech,” Shaw said.

Shaw is worried that the more extreme ideas about Māori – and denial over how colonisation has affected Māori wellbeing – could become entrenched, should the parties who hold those views get into power.

“[These views] come from a place of deep and unacknowledged fear, and it is a fear of reckoning with a history which is selectively being forgotten.”","Racism, threats and home invasions: candidates face abuse on New Zealand’s campaign trail",1

Air Force veteran Ashli Babbitt, 35, was killed as Trump loyalists stormed Congress Wednesday, halting President-elect Joe Biden's confirmation with violence and destruction that left four of the mob dead and sent shockwaves around the world.

Now a murder hunt is under way for the pro-Trump rioters who killed Capitol Hill officer Brian Sicknick, who died late Thursday after apparently being hit over the head with a fire extinguisher.

But far from being chastened, 'Stop the Steal' conspiracy theorists, right-wing militia groups and white supremacists are 'focused on trying to keep the energy up.'

And we can reveal that, as outrage grows over lax security that allowed protesters to breeze through police lines into the Capitol, Trump loyalists are making plans to descend on the nation's capital once more this Saturday.

Trump supporter Ashli Babbitt, who was shot dead by Capitol Hill police in Wednesday's riot, is being hailed a martyr by online extremists

Online Trump extremists are saying the bullet that killed the 35-year-old army vet is 'the first shot in a revolution.' A mob of Trump supporters are seen storming the Capitol

Just days before Wednesday's insurrection, extremists posted detailed maps and plans to storm the Capitol on pro-Trump forums, DailyMail.com can reveal. 'There needs to be dead traitors after this,' one post read

Jared Holt, Visiting Research Fellow with the Atlantic Council's Digital Forensic Research Lab and an expert in online disinformation and extremism told DailyMail.com: 'Since Wednesday's events, we've seen extremist communities really focused on trying to keep the energy up.

A murder hunt is under way for the pro-Trump rioters who killed Capitol Hill officer Brian Sicknick (pictured) who died late Thursday after apparently being hit over the head with a fire extinguisher

'They have portrayed the woman who was shot and killed as a martyr for the cause, talking about the shot that killed her as, ''the first shot fired in a revolution,'' and there are developing plans for a Second Amendment rally in DC on Saturday though the details have not been hashed out yet.'

Holt also revealed that he has monitored, 'a lot of conversation…looking towards the inauguration,' but cautioned that it was too early to tell how much would come to fruition and noted that he and his team are not aware of any concrete plans.

He said: 'There were, I believe, four or five different pro-Trump events that were formally scheduled that brought people into the city.

'I think if similar events are organized [this weekend] a lot of people that have similar sentiments or connections to extremist movements will turn up in DC again.'

The revelation comes as both the House and Senate Sergeants at Arms and the Capitol Hill Police chief were ordered to quit by Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer in the wake of the fiasco.

DC Mayor Muriel Bowser has imposed a State of Emergency on the city to last 15 days and an 'unscalable' fence is being erected around the Capitol's perimeter.

Critics have also pointed to the fact that Trump has being heralding this day since December 19 when he first announced his intentions to hold a rally January 6 telling loyalists, 'it's going to be wild.'

In one message shared with DailyMail.com a veteran tells fellow Trump loyalists that, before leaving for DC he told his children, 'daddy might not come home.' And added that he has sworn to defend his country, 'against all enemies, both Foreign and Domestic'

DailyMail.com can reveal that, just days before the insurrection, extremists posted detailed maps of the Capitol on pro-Trump forums along with the battle-cry, 'Surround the Swamp,' and 'floated' the idea of storming it.

DFR Lab research fellow Holt said: 'Just two or three days before the rallies took place there were plans shared about surrounding the US Capitol and those plans included a map of all the tunnels going into the Capitol and different entry points.'

Online expert Jared Holt (pictured) told DailyMail.com, 'Since Wednesday's events, we've seen extremist communities really focused on trying to keep the energy up'

But, while Holt and his colleagues frequently share material with law enforcement, it is, he said, extremely difficult for authorities to take action in the absence of any concrete plans.

He said, 'There was not, from our monitoring, any clear stated logistical plan for storming the Capitol but it was an idea that was frequently floated among the users of these communities.'

Holt has been monitoring communications between extremists on both mainstream and alternative social media platforms throughout Trump's presidency but, in recent weeks, has seen them use, 'increasingly desperate and heated rhetoric regarding the transition of power in this country.'

He explained, 'Working for the Atlantic Council's DFR Lab I've been focused on extremist activity online and the threats that it poses to the democratic process.

'Earlier I was looking at extremist attempts to intimidate voters at polls [more recently it has been] regarding the transition of power in this country and shifting towards discussing the need to potentially take matters into their own hands.'

The conversations take place on pro-Trump forums as well as social media platforms such as GAB, Parler and MeWe. These and others are favored by extreme groups because they take a light hand moderating content more often banned on Facebook and Twitter.

Holt and his colleagues say they have witnessed an online acceleration of a loyal fervor that, he explained, has its roots in the beginning of Trump's presidency.

He explained, 'Something really unique about these extremist movements during the Trump presidency is that, throughout history, right-wing extremism has tended to be antagonistic towards federal government in the United States.

'But with Trump, for the first time, a lot of these extremist movements saw a political leader who they thought sympathized with their cause and they rallied behind him.

'Leading up to the election and in the time period after they have looked to Trump and largely taken their cues from him.

'They really believed eventually the results of the election would be modified to present him the win that they believe he successfully earned and that they would defeat the nefarious forces they believe exist in federal government.'

When this appeared not to be happening talk turned towards wanting to take action.

Among the alarming conversations Holt has witnessed online were discussions of overwhelming authorities with the sheer size of the crowd in order to violate laws.

He said, 'For example in DC you can't carry firearms unless you have a DC permit so there were conversations of, 'well, if enough of us do this they can't stop it.'

In messages shared with DailyMail.com there are references to being 'locked and loaded' and numerous protesters state their intention to be armed at Wednesday's DC rally. One would-be protester asked, 'If you aren't marching armed…is there a point to marching at all?'

According to Holt there were conversations in these communities between users telling each other they were ready to, 'make the ultimate sacrifice in order to 'save the country,' in their words.'

In one message shared with DailyMail.com a veteran tells fellow Trump loyalists that, before leaving for DC he told his children, 'daddy might not come home.' And added that he has sworn to defend his country, 'against all enemies, both Foreign and Domestic.'

Violent rhetoric was directed against perceived adversaries in the form of Black Live Matters and anti-fascist groups.

Holt said, 'There was a lot of chatter and excitement about going into the streets and spilling the blood of people they believe are communist or sympathetic to those causes.'

Later, he added, talk 'shifted to feeling antagonistic towards police in DC who they believed were sympathetic towards the groups they disliked.'

On a few sparse occasions individual local and federal officials were mentioned as targets.

In the aftermath of Wednesday's debacle many extremists who were not on the ground took to social media to spread misinformation stating that any trouble was caused by BLM protesters or Antifa.

Holt said, 'There was a kind of joke that, half of the right-wing social media was trying to claim that Antifa was responsible for what was happening at the Capitol while the other half was uploading pictures of themselves breaking into it.'

That pride in their 'achievement' may yet prove the downfall of many, as the FBI has solicited public help to identifying protesters videoed and pictured swarming the Capitol.

President Donald Trump released a short video Thursday night where he blasted the 'heinous' attack and called for national 'healing' – and called for an 'orderly' and 'seamless' transition to a new administration

For his part Holt acknowledged the difficulty in policing the online world that he researches and in which so much hatred thrives. But it is, he said, something with which the next administration will have to grapple if positive change is to be made.

He said, 'Extremist researchers and far right reporters have been cautioning people for years that what has come alive during the Trump era won't go quietly into the night when Trump leaves.

'Even once Biden takes office we're still going to have millions of people that hold false beliefs that the election was the result of some sort of nefarious coup in this country and anti-government extremist groups and militia movements have had their numbers swell leading up to and after the election.

'The question now is how President elect Joe Biden can attempt to mend the country and combat the threat that these groups may present during his administration.

He added, 'The topic of online moderation and accountability for social media companies, and their complacency in terms of this sort of activity on their platforms, has to be part of a solution to what we have seen play out.

'Until law makers and regulators really attempt to grapple with that I don't think we're going to see lasting solutions to these problems.'",Trump supporters call Ashli Babbitt a 'martyr' and say death was 'the first shot in a revolution',1

He was a teenager looking for the 'thrill' of telling people what to do, 'running around with an AR-15' with 'neither the honor nor the legal right to do so.'

This is what Assistant District Attorney Thomas Binger stood to tell the jury as he began the state's closing arguments in Kenosha County Courthouse today.

Urging the jury to 'keep an open mind,' he said, 'In America it's hard these days. There's polarization, but this is not a political case and there's common ground here.

'I asked you at the beginning of this to raise your hand if you think human life is more important than property.

'We can also agree that no one person's life is more important than another. All life is sacred.'

Now that they have heard all the testimony and all the evidence, Binger told the jury, 'It's time to search for the truth.'

Assistant District Attorney Thomas Binger told the jury Rittenhouse was looking for the 'thrill' of telling people what to do, 'running around with an AR-15' with 'neither the honor nor the legal right to do so'. Binger held Rittenhouse's AR-15 aloft as he spoke, pointing it on the corner of the court.

Closing arguments in the murder trial of Kyle Rittenhouse began Monday. He stands accused of shooting dead two and injuring a third

Binger told them he would focus in on the murders – the shootings of two unarmed men – and the wounding of another.

He asked, 'Consider whether it is honorable to provoke and shoot unarmed people. Whether it is honorable when a person lies about being an EMT.'

He told them to 'consider Anthony Huber' a man whom he painted as a 'hero' who had 'rushed towards danger to save other people's lives.'

This was a characterization from which Binger had backed away during the state's case, when the defense threatened to bring in evidence of Huber's violent criminal past.

Binger said he was going to focus on the murders, then address some background issues and finally tie it all into the jury instructions.'

In a chilling moment Binger moved to 're-enact' what he claimed was visible on blurry drone footage, controversially brought before the jury.

According to Binger, Rittenhouse can be seen placing down the fire extinguisher he was carrying, pausing and raising his gun – pointing it at an unseen person off screen.

Binger, held Rittenhouse's AR-15 aloft, as he spoke, pointing it on the corner of the court.

This, he said, was the moment Rittenhouse 'lost the right to self-defense' and 'provoked' the violence that followed.

Binger had promised that he would be replaying many of the video exhibits from the night and so he did – pointing out the narrative on which the State has insisted. It is a story in which Rittenhouse is the agitator, the aggressor, the one making the calls and taking the shots.

Using still images and showing distressing images and video once more Binger said he would 'debunk' the claim that Rosenbaum ever threatened to kill Rittenhouse that night as has been testified.

He noted that it was the only part of the night 'not caught on video' and that was because 'there was no threat.'

Rittenhouse's mother says he was being 'chased by a mob' and is now being treated for PTSD Kyle Rittenhouse's mother has defended him shooting and killing two BLM protesters last summer, saying it was either their lives or her teenage son's who was being 'chased by a mob'. In an interview with NBC Nightly News on Sunday, Rittenhouse's mother Wendy said she believes her son - who sobbed on the witness stand - did a 'good job' giving evidence. She said he is being treated for PTSD and that she is standing by him, claiming he would be dead if he hadn't brought his AR-15 rifle to the riot last August. 'A lot of people shouldn't have been there. He brung that gun for protection and to this day, if he didn't have that gun my son would have been dead. 'He went down there to help. And he was chased by a mob,' she said. 'Wendy said she was 'scared' ahead of the verdict, and that she was a 'nervous wreck' when her son took the stand last week. 'Twelve people have my son's life in their hands. I will always stand by him,' she said Advertisement

Binger showed the jury 'the defendant murdering Joseph Rosenbaum from three different angles:' videographer Drew Hernandez's video, drone footage and FBI surveillance footage.

He contended that at best this was a 'fist fight.' Rosenbaum was unarmed.

Binger said, 'What you don't do is you don't bring a gun to a fist fight.'

He dismissed Rittenhouse's claim that Rosenbaum was trying to take his gun and use it on him or other as 'cockamamie'

He said, 'You lose the right to self-defense when you're the one bringing the gun.'

In an odd moment of grandstanding Binger told the court to ignore talk of Joshua Ziminski – a man whom he has repeatedly referenced during the trial and the one who fired a shot moments before Rittenhouse turned and shot Rosenbaum.

Now Binger said he planned to 'carve Ziminski out of this case,' he was 'a red herring.'

He added, 'I'll deal with him at his arson trial in January.'

Where the defense has made much of the speed at which events happened – all four shots were fired within 0.76 seconds – Binger said that the ferocious pace made Rittenhouse more culpable.

He said, 'He doesn't get a pass by pulling the trigger fast. He could have stopped after the first shot.'

Instead, he said, he 'tracks Mr. Rosenbaum's body down,' shooting as he fell.

He said, 'No-one else made him do it.'

Binger's voice rose, shrill as he said that the only way the jury could find self-defense was, 'If you believe that Joseph Rosenbaum was reaching for the defendant's gun.

'And that a reasonable person in the defendant's position, with the AR-15 strapped to his chest, would think that Joseph Rosenbaum was even capable of taking the gun away, as he's falling to the ground with a fractured pelvis.

'And then that Joseph Rosenbaum was going to turn the gun around and kill the defendant. And other people.

'You'd have to find all of those things.'

For the first time during the entire trial demonstrators could be heard outside the courtroom as Binger rose to continue his closing statement Monday afternoon.

Turning his attention to Grosskreutz, Binger characterized him as a person who 'could have aimed and fired [his own gun] but he did not'. Rittenhouse is seen on the ground before shooting Grosskreutz

Binger once again played the footage filmed by Richie McGinniss as he flipped Rosenbaum onto his back and desperately tried to locate a wound to put pressure on. Rosenbaum's groans were uncomfortably audible.

'You want to talk about medics? You want to talk about people who cared? You just saw them,' Binger said. 'And while that's going on the defendant flees, callously disregarding the body of the man he just shot and killed.

'And while he's running off he's lying to the crowd about what just happened.'

Rittenhouse told a passer-by that Rosenbaum 'pulled a gun' on him.

Binger said, 'The defendant is lying to save his own skin instead of going to help the person that he just shot and killed.'

Rittenhouse told Gaige Grosskreutz and witness Jason Lackowski, both of whom he ran past as he left the scene, that he 'did not shoot anyone.'

In fact, Binger insisted, Rittenhouse did nothing to persuade the crowd that he was 'anything other than a threat to kill again.'

The crowd has the right to defend themselves, Binger insisted. And they did so – tackling Rittenhouse as he fled.

Turning his attention to Grosskreutz, Binger characterized him as a person who 'could have aimed and fired [his own gun] but he did not.'

He said, 'That is a decision he was not prepared to make. He is not the type of person who is just willing to take a person's life in an instance – unlike the defendant.'

Despite that fact that Grosskreutz testified that he had pointed his gun at Rittenhouse Binger stated, 'At no point does Mr. Grosskreutz point his gun at the defendant.'

According to Binger, Rittenhouse had, 'No remorse, no regard for human life.'

He was 'an active shooter' who 'walks away like he's some sort of hero in a Western, without a care in the world about what he's done.'

Judge Bruce Schroeder dismissed count 6 from Rittenhouse's rap sheet – illegal possession of a firearm

Earlier Monday morning, Judge Bruce Schroeder dismissed count 6 from Kyle Rittenhouse's rap sheet – illegal possession of a firearm.

In the latest blow to the beleaguered prosecution, Judge Schroeder dropped the charge Monday morning after the defense successfully argued that it is illegal for anyone under 18 to carry a 'short-barreled rifle' - a rifle with a barrel shorter than 16 inches - but it is legal to carry a longer rifle in Wisconsin.

Rittenhouse was 17 at the time of the shootings and the prosecution was forced to concede that the AR-15 carried by Rittenhouse on August 25, 2020 was more than 16 inches, which is of legal length.

'Well then,' Judge Schroeder stated, 'Count six is dismissed.'

The prosecution staked its case on evidence that, the judge warned Monday morning, could see the case, 'fall like a house of cards.'

Judge Schroeder made his comment as he and attorneys for both sides finalized the instructions to be read to the jury ahead of closing arguments this morning.

The judge was referring to enhanced drone footage that, the state contends, shows Rittenhouse pointing his gun at people before he shoots Joseph Rosenbaum.

The defense argued unsuccessfully for the images, blurry at best and enhanced using an algorithm that the state's expert witness admitted to not understanding, to be excluded from evidence.

Judge Schroeder ultimately decided to allow the images into evidence, stating that he would 'allow the jury to decide the important factors in this case.'

But today, when the point was raised once more, he warned Assistant District Attorney James Kraus, 'This [technicality] is not being used to decide which camera I'm going to buy at a store. This is being used to decide whether someone is guilty or not of a crime.

'I don't want to be meddling or commenting on the evidence, but I will tell you this assuming that there is a conviction one or more assuming that other motions don't contaminate the outcome if it comes out at some time that the method used produces unreliable results this is going to fall like a house of cards.

'You're basing an extremely important part of the evidence on something I'm really queasy about. But this is the jury's case not mine.'

He concluded, 'I'm not going to make an instruction on it, but I've made a record on the high risk I think it presents to the case.'

As he continued his closing statements Binger sought to paint two of the men shot by Rittenhouse as 'heroes' and to dismiss the notion that Rosenbaum was ever any sort of threat, describing him as nothing but a 'little dog'

Rittenhouse and the other 'vigilantes' who gathered in Kenosha that night were, Binger said, 'Just wannabe soldiers, acting tough. Just a small part of the deluge of chaos tourists trying to feed off what we were going through, despite everything we did to try to tell them to go away, stay out'

As he continued his closing statements Binger sought to paint two of the men shot by Rittenhouse as 'heroes' and to dismiss the notion that Rosenbaum was ever any sort of threat, describing him as nothing but a 'little dog.'

'Bark, bark, bark!,' he said, 'He really ain't going to do anything.'

Showing close-up and graphic images of Grosskreutz's shredded bicep Binger said,' 'It's hard to look at but this is what we're dealing with. When you fire an AR-15.

'I guarantee you the defendant had no clue what his gun was capable of, he didn't concern himself what he would be doing to other people.

'Let's not flinch away from this it's important we understand what that gun was capable of that night. It killed two people and it did this to Mr. Grosskreutz's arm.'

The way Binger told it Rittenhouse, 'should have known' that pointing his gun as someone else would have 'provoked' Rosenbaum.

He 'should have known,' the crowd was aware of the fact he had just shot someone. And he 'should have known' that they believed him to be an 'active shooter'

According to Binger, 'That crowd did something that honesty I'm not sure I'd have the courage to do.

'Anthony Huber was different, 'jump-kick man' was different, Gaige Grosskreutz was different.'

According to Binger, 'That crowd was full of heroes.' Huber was a' hero' and Grosskreutz too – both men, he insisted, were acting within their own right to defend themselves as they tried to, 'stop an active shooter from shooting others.'

The defense will state their closing arguments following Binger's statements Monday. Mark Richards, defense attorney for Kyle Rittenhouse, is seen pacing the courtroom

In contrast, he said, Rittenhouse was 'a fraud,' falsely claiming to be a certified EMT. He was, 'like a quack doctor practicing without a license,' and putting lives at risk.

He wrapped a sprained ankle, helped someone with a cut on their hand. Binger mocked, 'Yay.'

And on the other hand, he killed two people and shot another. Binger snapped, 'When we balance your role as a medic that night…I don't give you any credit.'

He dismissed Rittenhouse and lionized Grosskreutz, saying, 'For him to call himself a medic is an insult to anyone like Gaige Grosskreutz who spent hundreds of hours training to become an EMT.'

Binger described him as a 'hero,' who 'rushed into danger,' and he told the jury that Grosskreutz never pointed his gun at Rittenhouse, despite Grosskreutz's own testimony that he did.

He told the court that Grosskreutz could well have pulled the trigger of his own gun and shot Rittenhouse, but that he didn't - 'because he's not that type of person.'

And he had harsh words for Rittenhouse's witness stand performance Wednesday. He said, 'When he testified on Wednesday, he broke down crying about himself not about anyone he hurt that night, no remorse.'

Rittenhouse and the other 'vigilantes' who gathered in Kenosha that night were, Binger said, 'Just wannabe soldiers, acting tough. Just a small part of the deluge of chaos tourists trying to feed off what we were going through, despite everything we did to try to tell them to go away, stay out.'

Binger mocked the 'threat' presented by Rosenbaum that night. 'What did he do?' he said, 'He tipped over a porta-potty that had no-one in it. He swung a chain. He set an empty trailer on fire. He said some bad words. He said the N-word.'

He said, 'I'd probably try to prosecute him for arson, but I can't because the defendant killed him. That's the way we deal with arson. We prosecute you. We don't execute them.'

Binger said he would be the voice for Rosenbaum because he wasn't there to speak for himself. The picture he painted was far from flattering in its bid to minimize any threat that he night have presented.

At 5ft 4, Binger said Rosenbaum had 'Napoleon complex.' He was a 'babbling idiot.'

He said that the crowd were 'shoving him around like a rag doll,' and that he was, 'a mouthy little guy…a little dog.'

According to Binger, the jury was there to decide facts, 'not to buy pathetic excuses.'

He said, 'If you panic that's not reasonable. That is an excuse. And if you're 17, you don't have experience…you're in over you head...those are excuses.

'They do not erase your personal responsibility for your own actions.'

In fact, Binger insisted, none of the people whom Rittenhouse shot, 'posed an imminent threat to the defendant's life or to cause great bodily harm.'

'Put yourself in the defendant's position,' he told them. 'Would you have made any of the reckless decisions he did? Would have you done the same thing?

'Would you have gone out after curfew with an AR-15 looking for trouble? Would you have used the gun to protect an empty car-lot?

'No reasonable person would have done these things. The defendant provoked everything.'

Wrapping up a closing statement, that lasted two hours and eight minutes, Binger concluded that there was no doubt that Rittenhouse had committed the crimes.

He said 'The question is whether or not you believe his actions were legally justified.

'I submit to you that no reasonable person would have done what the defendant did and that makes your decision easy.

'He is guilty of all counts.'

EXCLUSIVE: 'Binger was set up for failure!' Kenosha DA knew the case against Kyle Rittenhouse was a losing proposition and passed the buck to Thomas Binger whose presentation has been marked with missteps and clashes with the judge

-Martin Gould

The choice of prosecutor for Kyle Rittenhouse's murder case could be a precise pointer as to how little confidence the County District Attorney had in securing a conviction.

Mike Graveley, the Kenosha County DA would normally have taken the case himself, but instead handed it down to prosecutor Thomas Binger, whose presentation of the case in Wisconsin has been marked with missteps and clashes with Judge Bruce Schroeder.

'Binger was set up for failure,' one Kenosha legal insider told DailyMail.com. 'Graveley is the superstar and he knew this one was sure to tarnish it.'

According to conservative outlet Milwaukee Right Now, Graveley 'pawned the case off to his unfortunate assistant district attorney, Thomas Binger, who was left to spin gold out of a pile of self-defense straw.'

Now court observers believe that even if Rittenhouse is found guilty, Binger's performance has given him good grounds for appeal.

'He has said things in court that have been ruled out of order, but once they have been said, you can't unring that bell,' Kevin Mathewson, a criminal defense investigator and former Kenosha City alderman told DailyMail.com.

'This is how Binger has always operated. He pushes the envelope as far as he possibly can — but this time the whole world is watching him.'

Binger, 51, a graduate of the University of Michigan Law School is no rookie. He has been an assistant DA in Kenosha County since 2014, and first prosecuted cases in Milwaukee County back in 1999

Binger's presentation of the case in Wisconsin has been marked with missteps and clashes with Judge Bruce Schroeder

Mathewson, who was unsuccessfully sued over a Facebook page in which he asked for people to turn up with guns to defend property during the August 2020 Kenosha riots, has been a frequent critic of Graveley's office.

But he says he respects the DA's prosecuting skills. 'He is by far the best prosecutor in the office and he should be the one prosecuting the Rittenhouse trial — the most high-profile and difficult case his office is ever likely to handle.

'It's not that he hides from publicity. Earlier this year he prosecuted a teenager called Martice Fuller who killed his high school sweetheart and shot at her mother.

'That was a high-profile case, but it wasn't a difficult case to prosecute,' added Mathewson. 'There was video of the shooting.

'Just about any prosecutor could have got a conviction.'

Mathewson is not the only one who is hammering Graveley for his absence from the Rittenhouse case. Graveley himself said he would not lead the prosecution as he was investigating the case against the cop who shot Joseph Blake, leading to the unrest in Kenosha during which Rittenhouse shot and killed Joseph Rosenbaum and Anthony Huber.

Gravely — who was named Wisconsin's prosecutor of the year earlier this month — decided way back in January that the officer should not be prosecuted for the shooting which left Blake paralyzed. The DA also said he has to prosecute another case which will likely start before the Rittenhouse case is over.

But those excuses are getting short shrift from some, who believe Rittenhouse either should never have been prosecuted or should have faced lesser charges.

'It's time to put DA Mike Graveley's picture on a milk carton,' wrote Milwaukee Right Now.

Graveley's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Binger has at times seemed out of his depth as Judge Schroeder and Rittenhouse's defense team tear into him for a series of missteps.

Former Milwaukee County assistant district attorney Daniel Adams described Binger's case as 'incredibly underwhelming.'

'He's got nothing,' Adams told the Associated Press. 'I just don't understand it. What are we doing here? We're all kind of scratching our heads.'

Binger, 51, a graduate of the University of Michigan Law School is no rookie. He has been an assistant DA in Kenosha County since 2014, and first prosecuted cases in Milwaukee County back in 1999.

On his LinkedIn page the father-of-three says: 'I was a criminal prosecutor handling misdemeanor and felony cases, including illegal firearms cases. I also handled child welfare cases, specializing in termination of parental rights cases.'

Mike Graveley, the Kenosha County DA, would normally have taken the case himself, but instead handed it down to prosecutor Thomas Binger. 'It's time to put DA Mike Graveley's picture on a milk carton,' wrote Milwaukee Right Now

After six years prosecuting, he went into private practice as director of litigation for a business law firm before joining the Kenosha County DA's office.

He ran unsuccessfully as a Democrat for the post of District Attorney in neighboring Racine County in 2016, saying: 'In the last two years as a prosecutor, I have won 13 jury trials. I have convicted murderers, rapists, child molesters, drug dealers, drunk drivers, home-invading burglars and men who abuse women.'

One of the most notable cases he has previously prosecuted was of a former New Jersey fire captain who was jailed for five years in 2017 for possessing child pornography and exploiting a child for sexual purposes.

Binger insisted the sentence was not enough, telling Essex News Daily, 'The state recommended 16 years.'

He was also forced to withdraw a case against Guy Smith, a trucker who was found with a gun in his cab. Smith's defense attorney pointed out the law specifically allowed handguns in vehicles without a concealed carry permit, the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported.

The Smith case was also heard by Judge Schroeder.

But those cases had nothing like the media spotlight that has shone on the Rittenhouse case.

Binger's role has been controversial since the start. He took the unusual step of objecting to the attempt by California attorney John Pierce to represent Rittenhouse, saying in a six-page motion to the court that Pierce's presence could 'materially prejudice' the case.

He said Pierce's 'personal financial difficulties raise significant ethical concerns,' adding: 'Given his own substantial personal debts, his involvement with an unregulated and opaque 'slush fund' provides ample opportunity for self-dealing and fraud

'Money that should be held in trust for the defendant may instead be used to repay Attorney Pierce's numerous creditors.'

Pierce, who claimed the case against Rittenhouse was a 'political prosecution' eventually withdrew, leaving the defense in the hands of lawyer Mark Richards.

Binger has continued to clash with Judge Schroeder throughout the trial and even in pre-trial hearings

Binger clashed with Schroeder in pre-trial hearings. Last month the judge ruled against him saying that the men shot by Rittenhouse could not be called 'victims' during the trial but allowed a defense motion which allows them to be called rioters, looters or arsonists.

Binger said those words were more loaded than 'victims.'

The prosecutor also lost the chance to link Rittenhouse to the right-wing Proud Boys movement.

And Schroeder later slammed him after he argued that defense lawyers should not be able to tell jurors about the destructive actions of Joseph Rosenbaum, one of the men Rittenhouse admits killing, including setting a dumpster on fire.

'All we're talking about is arson. We're talking about being loud and disorderly,' Binger said.

Schroeder immediately cut him off. 'I can't believe some of what you're saying,' he said in a raised voice. 'All we're talking about is arson? Come on!'

During this month's trial, Schroeder reprimanded Binger for bringing up a video in which Rittenhouse had talked about wanting to shoot shoplifters. Schroeder had previously ruled that inadmissible

'You're an experienced trial attorney and you're telling me when the judge says, 'I'm excluding this' you decide to bring it in because you think you've found a way around it,' Schroeder asked.

Binger replied: 'You can yell at me if you want. I was acting in good faith.'

Judge Schroeder responded: 'I don't believe you. When you say you were acting in good faith, I don't believe you. There better not be another incident.'

Rittenhouse's defense accused Binger of knowingly attempting to throw the proceeding because they were going badly for the state.

The defense on November 10 demanded a mistrial with prejudice, which would mean that Rittenhouse walks free and a retrial is not possible. Schroeder said he is taking that request under advisement.","Kyle Rittenhouse traveled to Kenosha 'expecting violence', prosecution claims in closing arguments",1

Screenshots taken Saturday evening show that @COSAntiFascists, the Colorado Springs cell of the domestic terror group, has, in fact, been nixed - with reporter Andy Ngo the first to break the news.

Ngo, an editor for The Post Millennial, had been one of many onlookers to express anger last month over the terror group's continued presence on the social media platform, even after Musk took control of the company in late October.

The Colorado group - which had 15,000 followers- is one of several far-left profiles scrubbed in the past week, with many seemingly linked to Antifa, which has thousands of cells across the country.

It comes as Musk last month announced he would permanently suspend accounts without warning, if they promote violence and are not labeled as parody.

Musk had one point argued against lifetime bans, but after several celebrity and blue-check verified users changed their accounts to mimic his own, he ordered the policy be revamped.

It also comes amid increased suspicion of cooperation between Twitter and the FBI in scrubbing and ignoring certain accounts - with Twitter Files journalist Matt Taibbi Saturday sharing documents that exposed the extent of the alleged censorship.

Ngo on Saturday tweeted: 'Breaking: @COSAntiFascists, the Colorado Springs cell of #Antifa, has been suspended on Twitter,' sharing screenshots of an alert noting the account had been suspended and some of the group's more problematic posts.

Posts shared by the journalist included calls from organizers for their supporters to vandalize local pro-life pregnancy centers following the recent Roe v. Wade Supreme Court reversal, and orders instructing followers to assault prominent right-wingers.

'The account has operated for years instructing comrades to assault people & directing members to get the home addresses, phone numbers of targets,' Ngo wrote, adding, 'It had 15k followers.'

A month earlier, Ngo shared his concern about the group's presence on Twitter in a reply to a post from Musk, where he called on users on to air any issues with the site that he should address following his highly publicized takeover.

'Removing child exploitation is priority #1,' Musk, 51, wrote at the time. 'Please reply in comments if you see anything that Twitter needs to address.'

Ngo - an outspoken critic of the terror group - replied and noted that a large number accounts used by its members and hundreds of cells across the country are used to incite violence.

Ngo noted that Despite this, hundreds of Antifa accounts remain unbanned, with a list of more than 5000 Antifa and Antifa follower accounts currently being circulated

Ngo, an editor for The Post Millennial, had been one of many onlookers to express anger last month over the terror group's continued presence on the social media platform, even after Musk took control of the company in late October

The journalist at the time noted how those groups brazenly 'promote riots, give tips on how to commit violent crimes and post names, photos and addresses of targets plus their family members,' sharing screenshots to support his claims.

Musk - who at one point argued against bans and said he would reverse one on Donald Trump - responded by stating that 'Incitement to violence' to any extent, 'will result in account suspension.'

As several accounts linked to the terror group were stripped this week, members of a cell in Portland threatened arson and attacks on Musk-owned Tesla dealerships as a method of retaliation.

Aside from several Antifa branches, those suspended included an antifascist group that provides armed security for LGBTQ+ events in North Texas, and CrimethInc, an conservative collective that has been critical of leftist movements since the mid-90s.

Antifa has come under fire in recent years for purported attacks on Ngo, after he published a book chiding the organization - who often appear at right-wing processions donning riot gear and masks - titled Unmasked: Inside Antifa's Radical Plan to Destroy Democracy.

The book described the alleged illegality of the group's continued activities, stating that the group's mission statement is to undermine the American government, while also describing how he was attacked by members in Portland while going undercover as one of their own during a protest outside a police precinct in 2021.

The site of the center is near a planned $90 million police training center, which has been the focal point of protests for months by Antifa who have referred to the site as Cop City.

On Friday, five members of the group's Portland branch - which made headlines in 2020 when members were filmed clashing with the a Portland Proud Boys chapter on the city's streets - were arrested on Friday for domestic terrorism charges after they were protesting outside the planned center, due to the group's stance on 'defunding' America's police forces.

A contraction of the phrase 'anti-fascist,' Antifa refers to the group's sprawling network of far-left militants in America's fifty states and other countries as well, that oppose beliefs members deems fascist, racist, or the views of right-wing extremists.

The group surfaced in 2016, after the election of Donald Trump, who in 2020 - as the group continued to appear at high-profile clashes across the country - sought to classify the group as a terrorist organization.

However, citing the group's lack of a central infrastructure, the FBI has not shared that stance, electing to not engage in a mass purge prior to Musk's based on arguments that cells could just liberal-leaning individuals and websites that aren’t necessarily affiliated with the extremist group.

The group surfaced in 2016, after the election of Donald Trump, who in 2020 - as the group continued to appear at high-profile clashes across the country - called the group a 'terrorist organization'

Following Trump's falling out of office, the bureau's hesitance to stymy the various groups' continued presence on social media lead many to theorize the agency is acting as a vehicle of the Democrat party.

Those sentiments were seemingly confirmed Saturday, after Taibbi leaked further documents revealing that an FBI agent last slammed Twitter 's 'gross subservience' to the bureau, while revealing other firms were 'totally adversarial' when asked to hand over customers' details.

The files were the latest in a series of documents to be released in a massive evidence dump dubbed by Musk as the Twitter Files, after Twitter's new owner gave a group of hand-picked journalists access to the company's internal records.

'Between January 2020 and November 2022, there were over 150 emails between the FBI and former Twitter Trust and Safety chief Yoel Roth,' claimed Taibbi.

'But a surprisingly high number are requests by the FBI for Twitter to take action on election misinformation, even involving joke tweets from low-follower accounts,' he added.

Those singled out were shocked, with one asking how 'an amoeba' like himself had come onto the FBI's radar, while another said it was 'crazy' that the FBI was 'policing jokes'.

Antifa has come under fire in recent years for purported attacks on Ngo, after he published a book chiding the organization - who often appear at right-wing processions donning riot gear and masks - titled Unmasked: Inside Antifa's Radical Plan to Destroy Democracy

A third added: 'Anyone who cannot discern obvious satire from reality has no place making decisions for others or working for the feds.'

In one email from November 6, 2022, FBI Assistant Special Agent in Charge Elvis Chan forwarded Twitter staff a lengthy list of accounts for review.

Chan wrote that the FBI believed the accounts were 'violating [Twitter's] terms of service by disseminating false information about the time, place or manner of the upcoming elections.'

The list of accounts had been sent to Chan by the FBI's National Election Command Post, which compiles and forwards complaints, indicating that the list may have been based on community tips submitted to the FBI.

The list included Billy Baldwin, the brother of actors Alec and Stephen Baldwin, as well as what appear to be several satire accounts and the right-wing news and commentary outlet Right Side Broadcasting Network.

One of the accounts had as few as seven followers; almost all of the 29 flagged by the FBI had under 10,000 followers.

Following Trump's falling out of office, the bureau's hesitance to stymy the various groups' continued presence on social media lead many to theorize the agency is acting as a vehicle of the Democratic party

The most high-profile were Baldwin's, with 204,900 followers, and Right Side Broadcasting Network, with almost 875,000.

Only two of the rest had more than 10,000 followers.

'It's no secret the government analyzes bulk data for all sorts of purposes, everything from tracking terror suspects to making economic forecasts,' said Taibbi.

'The #TwitterFiles show something new: agencies like the FBI and DHS regularly sending social media content to Twitter through multiple entry points, pre-flagged for moderation.'

A Twitter employee responded to Chan on the morning of November 8, indicating which accounts had been suspended.

Baldwin's account was not suspended in the action, and Twitter also spared several other accounts that the FBI had named, including RSB Network.",Why did the FBI not flag Antifa Twitter accounts? Elon Musk finally removes far-left profiles,1
https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-9985471/Rudy-Giuliani-says-NOT-drunk-rambling-September-11th-speech-Cipriani.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ito=1490&ns_campaign=1490,1,"Former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani is furiously denying accusations he was drunk during a speech at Cipriani the evening of September 11th where he imitated the Queen – saying he only had one Scotch and that he is the victim of a left-wing effort to disparage him.

‘Yes I had a Scotch. But I was not drunk. There is a deliberate attempt [by] the left wing to paint me that way,’ he told DailyMail.com in an interview Sunday evening.

He also denied mocking the Queen when he made comments, captured on video, where he adopted a faux English accent and said: ‘You did a wonderful job on Sept. 11. And therefore I’m making you an honorary knight, commander of the royal something or other.'

‘That was a serious speech. To say I mocked anybody is outrageous. And that I was drunk is completely, completely wrong,’ said Giuliani.

In addition to explaining his comments – made at an evening event on the 20th anniversary of the Sept. 11th attacks that established his brand as ‘America’s mayor’ long before he sought to dig up dirt on Joe Biden in Ukraine – Giuliani said unsubstantiated accusations of public inebriation were harmful to his reputation, and were being undertaken because of his efforts on behalf of Donald Trump.

‘I am without a doubt the most accomplished prosecutor of the 20th Century,’ he said, pointing to his earlier career in the Southern District of New York, where he served as a US attorney, and where he is now under investigation.

Giuliani said the idea that he was mocking the Queen is ‘an interpretation that’s totally unfair. I use an English accent.’

He said that when receiving an honorary knighthood he told the Queen he rested on the shoulders of giants, and she responded to him that: “That’s why you’re such a great leader.” It was a beautiful interchange.’

‘And I have never mocked it. I just like to use an English – I imitate Churchill sometimes.'

The former New York City mayor and Donald Trump lawyer also addressed his comments Saturday night about Prince Andrew, which he brought up unprompted during his speech.

‘Never had a drink with him, never was with a woman or young girl with him. Ever, ever, ever,’ Giuliani said during his speech.

He said he did not know when he made the comment that it had been reported that the royal had been served with legal papers.

‘Yes I had a Scotch. But I was not drunk. There is a deliberate attempt [by] the left wing to paint me that way,’ former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani told DailyMail.com in an interview Sunday evening

‘I didn’t know that. I didn’t know that he was served,’ he said.

‘But the thing about Andrew they laughed about,’ he continued.

‘When I got to the subject of Andrew – he’s the one that came and told me I was going to be knighted,’ Giuliani explained.

In his Sunday night phone call, he recounted the story of a comment he made to Andrew before touring Ground Zero. ‘What I said to him when we went outside was, “Don’t want you to be shocked when we walk over to Ground Zero because you’re going to pass a man that you killed. He said what? I said you’re going to pass Nathan Hale,’ Giuliani said of the colonial era Patriot.

Asked why he brought up Andrew, Giuliani said ‘I always tell the story about Prince Andrew, about how I was knighted. I’ve told it for 20 years. Whatever he did with that pervert, the mere fact is a historical fact that he’s the one who brought me the knighthood.’ He said he told the story because he wanted to show that ‘my two guys were knighted,’ in reference to former New York City Police Commissioner Bernie Kerik and another official.

Pressed on whether he was drinking during the speech, Giuliani responded that he had a single glass of Scotch.

‘I am not a drunk. I don’t think I’ve ever [been] publicly drunk in my life. The last time I was – was probably in college. I like to drink Scotch and have cigars. That’s where it probably comes from. I drink moderate amounts of Scotch. I mostly drink Scotch because I like to have it with cigars. I didn’t have a cigar last night. And this is a caricature that the left is trying to put on me … I can’t remember the last time that I was drunk. And I’m not just going to put up with it anymore. I’ve got to do something about it.’

Rudy Giuliani mimicked Queen Elizabeth’s English accent, denied hanging out with Prince Andrew, and called America’s top military officer an ‘idiot’ and ‘a*****e’ during a 9/11 commemoration dinner in Manhattan on Saturday

In February 2002, just months after the September 11 attacks, Giuliani was awarded an honorary knighthood by Queen Elizabeth II. During Saturday's dinner, Giuliani tried to mimic the monarch

Asked if he had a drink at the event, Giuliani responded: ‘Yes, of course, I had a Scotch at the beginning of dinner. Beyond that, I didn’t have – it was watered down. Not even sure I drank the whole damn thing.’

‘I did a one-hour interview with Steve Bannon. You can watch it on television. See if I’m drunk,’ he said.’ He said he sat for the interview five minutes before he gave the speech.

‘It hurts my reputation for someone to say I’m drunk,’ he continued. ‘And this is a concerted attempt to do this … I’m willing to be criticized for what’s true. I’m sure as hell not going to be characterized as a drunk, which I’m not.’

Giuliani bristled when asked to explain a comment he made last month to NBC, where he also denied having a drinking problem and called himself ‘functioning,’ amid anonymous comments by former White House aides about his alleged drinking.

‘I'm not an alcoholic,’ Giuliani told the network. ‘I’m a functioning, I probably function more effectively than 90 percent of the population.’

He recoiled when DailyMail.com asked if he had been making a connection to the term ‘functioning alcoholic.’

‘I’m not an alcoholic. I use the word functioning, I don’t know why I used the word functioning. I am not an alcoholic. I am 77 years old. I’ve never been an alcoholic. I’ve never been treated for alcoholism. I have worked every day of my life. The longest time I ever took off was for COVID.

'If I was an alcoholic, I’d be fricking dead by now. It is [a] complete lie. I’m on television all the time. I’m as lucid as you can be. I’m not demented like Joe Biden. I can go before the Supreme Court … I have already many times. I write. I do a podcast twice a week. I do a radio show … five times a week. I answer questions from people constantly. I’m probably one of the sharpest guys you’re ever going to meet. And you want to put me in a court room and I’ll kick the s*** out of anybody. I am not an alcoholic.’

He said the word ‘functioning’ has ’10 other meanings. I’m not even sure of what the significance of using that word is. Am I a functioning alcoholic? No. I’m a fully functioning human being. About as fully functional as you can find. I think I usually work about 16 hours a day. And it’s outrageous that people are doing this to me. But it’s because I’m defending Donald Trump. That’s the reason they’re doing it. Nobody ever did this to me two years ago. I was the G-man of the year two years ago. I am without a doubt the most accomplished prosecutor of the 20th Century. Without doubt. There’s no question about it,’ he said.

Giuliani was the keynote speaker at the ‘G-Man Honors: A Salute To The FBI Heroes’ in November 2014. He also spoke at the event in 2015.

‘I prosecuted more people successfully, the heads of the mafia, Teamsters Union, took them apart, Ivan Boesky, [Michael] Milken, Wall Street, about 100 crooked politicians, terrorists. I even prosecuted two Nazis and had them sentenced to death. .. Nobody has a record like mine. And it’s outrageous. And the reason my allegations against Biden mean something is because I actually a professional. I caught him because I’m better than the rest of them. Plus, I had a pair of balls and they all know what would happen to them. They all knew what would happen to them – you get crucified. And I actually don’t give a damn if those idiots crucify me. But I’m not going to be called an alcoholic when I can prove that I’m not. I’m just getting tired of that.’

The speech that set off Giuliani's furious pushback came as he mimicked Queen Elizabeth’s English accent, denied hanging out with Prince Andrew and underage women, and called America’s top military officer an ‘idiot’ and ‘a*****e’ during a 9/11 commemoration dinner in Manhattan on Saturday.

The former New York City mayor spoke at the Cipriani restaurant on Saturday, appearing at an annual dinner event to commemorate the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks.

Giuliani's comments about Prince Andrew were made on the same day that lawyers for Virginia Giuffre said they served the British royal with legal papers. Giuffre alleges she was sexually assaulted by Prince Andrew - an allegation that he denies.

The rant on Saturday is just the latest bizarre public appearance by Giuliani - a once-beloved mayor who is credited with leading New York City out of the turmoil of the September 11, 2001 attacks but who has spiraled downward in recent years, raising questions about his sobriety and overall well-being.

In February 2002, just months after the September 11 attacks, Giuliani was awarded an honorary knighthood by Queen Elizabeth II in recognition of his leadership during the tragedy. During Saturday's dinner, Giuliani tried to mimic the monarch.

'She said, ""You did a wonderful job on Sept. 11"",' Giuliani said while attempting to imitate a British accent.

'And therefore I’m making you an honorary knight, commander of the royal something or other,' he said.

Giuliani then added: 'I turned down a knighthood because if you took a knighthood, you had to lose your citizenship.'

That claim is incorrect, as several Americans have been awarded honorary knighthoods without having to relinquish US citizenship.

Reports from 2001 state also that he had accepted the Queens' honor to become a Knight Commander of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire for his 'outstanding help and support to the bereaved British families in New York.'

At the time, he told reporters that he was 'humbled and gratified' to accept the accolade.

The rant on Saturday sparked concern from viewers, with one posting online: 'I’m not sure I have ever seen someone give a speech at a formal occasion as drunk as Rudy Giuliani is right now at the 9/11 dinner.'

Several clips posted to Twitter show Giuliani give a rambling talk at the podium.

The former mayor took aim at Joint Chiefs Chairman Mark Milley, whose name Giuliani mispronounces after referring to him as ‘Miley.’

‘How’s that guy a general?’ Giuliani said, slamming Milley and the Biden administration for the chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan, calling it ‘freaking insane.’

The former mayor, who most recently served as former President Donald Trump’s personal attorney, lashed out at Milley and the administration for withdrawing from the Bagram air base in Afghanistan.

Giuliani then describes how he would approach Milley if he saw him in person.

'I wanted to grab his stars and shove it down his throat and say, ""It's 400 miles from China, a-hole! China is going to be our enemy for the next 40 years! You have an airbase 400 miles from them and you're giving it up? Idiot!” Giuliani said.

'What the hell is wrong with you? Who pays you?'

Giuliani added: 'Christ!'

At another point in the speech, Giuliani, unprompted, then began to speak about Prince Andrew.

'I know Prince Andrew is very questionable now,' Giuliani said.

'I never went out with him. Ever!

'Never had a drink with him, never was with a woman or young girl with him.

'Ever, ever, ever.'

Giuliani said that he met Andrew on two separate occasions.

'One time, I met him in my office, and one time when we had the party,' Giuliani said.

Giuliani (seen above with his Knighthood of the British Empire, or KBE, medal in 2002) was the mayor of New York City and heralded for his response the 9/11 attacks. He coordinated the response and organized the support of state and federal authorities for the World Trade Center site, for citywide anti-terrorist measures, and for restoration of infrastructure

Giuliani's comments about Andrew were made on the same day that the British royal was sued by a woman who claims he assaulted her when she was 17.

Attorneys for Virginia Giuffre say the documents were handed over to a Metropolitan Police officer on duty at the main gates of Andrew’s home in Windsor Great Park in London at 9:30am on August 27.

The handover of the documents, first reported by the Daily Mail, is important because Andrew would be obliged to respond within 21 days of the summons.

'If you fail to respond, judgment by default will be entered against you for the relief demanded in the complaint,' Giuffre’s lawyers said in the documents.

But Blackfords, a law firm that said they represent Andrew 'in certain UK matters,' have questioned whether the papers were properly served and raised the possibility of challenging the court’s jurisdiction in the case, according to a September 6 letter referenced in court documents filed by Giuffre’s attorneys.

'We reiterate that our client reserves all his rights, including to contest the jurisdiction of the US courts (including on the basis of potentially defective service),' they wrote.

A US judge will ultimately determine whether the papers were properly delivered. Judge Lewis Kaplan of the US District Court for the Southern District of New York will hold the first pretrial conference in the case via teleconference on Monday.

The prince has repeatedly denied the allegations in the lawsuit brought by Giuffre, a longtime accuser of the late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.

When the suit was filed last month in the US District Court for the Southern District of New York, legal experts suggested it left Andrew with no good options as the second son of Queen Elizabeth II seeks to repair his image and return to public life.

If the prince tries to ignore the lawsuit, he runs the risk that the court could find him in default and order him to pay damages.

Giuliani's comments about Prince Andrew were made on the same day that lawyers for Virginia Giuffre said they served the British royal with legal papers. Giuffre alleges she was sexually assaulted by Prince Andrew - an allegation that he denies. From left: Andrew, Giuffre, and Ghislaine Maxwell, who allegedly procured underage girls for Jeffrey Epstein

Prince Andrew is seen above during a television interview in Windsor, England on April 11, 2021

And if he decides to fight, Andrew faces years of sordid headlines as the case winds its way through court.

Guiffre’s attorney, David Boies, said in court documents that it was implausible that Andrew is unaware of the suit.

'Attorneys at Blackfords, who he has apparently instructed to evade and contest service, have confirmed that Prince Andrew himself already has notice of this lawsuit and is evaluating his chances of success,' Boies wrote.

'And even if Blackfords had not confirmed as much, any other conclusion would be implausible - reputable media outlets around the world reported on the filing of plaintiff's complaint, and hundreds, if not thousands, of articles about this lawsuit have been published.'

The lawsuit is another unwanted story for the royals, reminding the public of Andrew’s links to Epstein two years after his death.

Britain’s royal family is also still recovering from allegations of racism and insensitivity leveled at them by Prince Harry and his wife, Meghan, earlier this year.

Giuliani was the mayor of New York City and heralded for his response the 9/11 attacks.

He coordinated the response and organized the support of state and federal authorities for the World Trade Center site, for citywide anti-terrorist measures, and for restoration of infrastructure.

He has since become a controversial figure over his support for Donald Trump's election fraud claims.

Giuliani's Upper East Side apartment was raided by the FBI in April amid a probe into his dealings with the Ukraine, although he is yet to be charged with any crime, and denies all allegations of wrongdoing.

On the eve of the 20th anniversary of the terrorist attacks, Giuliani and former New York Governor George Pataki were reunited with NYPD and FDNY officials for the first time since September 1, 2001.

Milley has been a target of pro-Trump forces since the top general reportedly expressed relief that Biden won last fall's presidential election.

Several books written about the waning days of the Trump presidency reported that Milley feared the outgoing president would attempt a coup in hopes of overturning the election results and staying in power.

Milley has also been criticized for the manner in which US forces pulled out of Afghanistan even while hundreds of American citizens as well as Afghans who helped the US military during the 20-year war remained behind in the country.

Last month, The Wall Street Journal reported that Biden ignored Milley's request to keep a force of 2,500 US troops in Afghanistan for fear that removing them would lead to a Taliban takeover.

Biden stayed firm with his decision to remove US troops by August 31, the Journal reported, because he believed the US was propping up an Afghan government on life support.

The president viewed the government in Kabul as corrupt and blamed it for wasting billions of dollars of US aid.

He and his advisers had hoped President Ashraf Ghani and the Afghan government would pull itself together once the U.S. laid out an exit date, the Journal said, however some military advisers warned that Ghani wasn't up to the task.

After capturing towns and villages throughout the country in the weeks and months leading up to the withdrawal, the Taliban entered Kabul on August 15, the same day Ghani fled Afghanistan.

Milley had argued that the US should keep a small fighting force in the country. There were about 2,500 US troops in Afghanistan when Biden took over the drawdown from former President Trump.

Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, who previously served as military commander in the region, warned that a full withdrawal wouldn't provide any insurance of stability.

Biden had argued that by reneging on the agreement Trump made with the Taliban, American forces and US allies could be exposed to more violence.

Levan Khabeishvili, who heads the United National Movement Party, which is pro-NATO and pro-European Union, shared a photo of himself after he had sustained horrific injuries after a night of fighting between protesters and police in Tbilisi.

The politician could be seen with a swollen black eye, a bloodied and broken nose, and a missing tooth after claiming he had been kidnapped and attacked for opposing the ruling party's 'foreign influence' law.

Khabeishvili later appeared in the Georgian parliament with his face wrapped in bandages as he opposed the legislation, which has been dubbed by critics as 'Kremlin-inspired'.

'If someone thinks we won't smile because we lose a tooth or can't open our eyes, they are very mistaken. We will smile because Georgia will win,' the politician told the chamber after being brought in in a wheelchair.

Clashes erupted between police and opposition demonstrators protesting a new bill intended to track foreign influence that the opposition denounced as 'Russia-inspired'

Georgia's deputy interior minister, Aleksandre Darakhvelidze, argued Khabeishvili had 'broken into the police cordon and resisted police to hinder their activities, receiving injuries as a result'.

The outbreak of violence seen on Tuesday night followed two weeks of demonstrations against the proposed foreign agent law that is reportedly set to destroy any hope of the Black Sea state joining the EU.

Khabeishvili claimed the legislation was similar to that seen in Russia, used by tyrant Vladimir Putin to silence dissent.

Georgia's opposition parties, the EU and the US have all criticised the bill, which would force NGOs, civil rights groups and media to register as 'foreign agents' if more than 20% of their funding comes from abroad.

The EU has warned that Georgia would face insurmountable barriers to joine the bloc if the legislation is allowed to come into force, ultimately pushing the country back into the orbit of Moscow.

Georgian politicians clashed in Parliament on Wednesday as they held the second vote regarding the bill, with one pro-government MP reportedly throwing a book at a member of an opposition party.

On Tuesday, masked and helmeted riot police flooded the streets in Georgia's capital and were spotted firing water cannons, tear gas, and launching stun grenades in a bid to break up a rally that had gathered outside the parliament building.

Horror images showed the chaos unraveling as demonstrators and riot police went head-to-head in the streets.

Protesters were pictured throwing kicks and punches at armed cops who had raised their plastic shields in a bid to protect themselves from the angered civilians.

Some individuals were seen donning gas masks while others bravely faced the police with no protection.

The EU, which has granted Georgia candidate status, on Wednesday 'strongly condemned' the violence and called on the government to respect the right of peaceful assembly.

'Use of force to suppress it is unacceptable,' the bloc's foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, said on X, formerly Twitter.

Police also fired rounds of rubber bullets, the AFP news agency reported, and over 60 people were arrested.

'This is undoubtedly a turning point for our country. Despite the police savagery witnessed last night, our protests will only grow louder in the days and weeks ahead,' Khabeishvili told The Times after being discharged from hospital.

The country's interior minister said six officers were injured during Tuesday night's demonstration, as authorities attempted to escalate their crack-down on the three-week-old protest movement.

Tuesday's rally continued overnight into the early hours of Wednesday morning, with around 2,000 people blocking traffic outside parliament on Tbilisi's main avenue and a number of other key roads, facing riot police who attacked protesters with their rubber batons.

Following the night of immense violence in the Georgian capital, the country's rights ombudsman, Levan Ioseliani, called for an investigation into the use of 'disproportionate force' against protesters and journalists - who had also reportedly been caught up in attacks.

The interior ministry insisted police had intervened - but only once it was too late and the peaceful protest had turned violent.

Protesters fear that the proposed foreign influence bill could be used to crush critical voices ahead of the parliamentary elections later this year.

A similar authoritarian law came into force in Russia in 2012 and has since been used to muzzle the voices that attempt to challenge the Kremlin - including prominent critical figures, media outlets, and civil society groups.

Several European leaders have warned the proposed bill is 'incompatible' with European norms and values - but the government of Georgian Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze is confident in his decision.

His government insists the bill is about ensuring transparency and rejects any notion that the law is against European values - or that it has been inspired from Russian legislation.

The crackdown in Tbilisi came just two days after Bidzina Ivanishvili, the founder of the Georgian Dream Party, which came to power in 2012, appeared to vow retribution against opposition leaders.

The party was forced to suspend plans to push through the foreign agent law after huge protests swept through the capital.

But billionaire Ivanishvili stated that this year his government would not back out.

Protesters began building barricades in the centre of Tbilisi in preparation for more protests on Wednesday evening.

'Today the whole world can see Bidzina Ivanishvili's government for what they are: a band of thugs who are determined to snuff out free speech and take Georgia back to the dark ages of Russian rule,' Khabeishvili said.

Parliament endorsed the bill in the first reading earlier this month and it must pass two more readings before becoming law.",Bloodied and battered for standing up to Georgia's new 'Putin-inspired' law: Opposition leader shows injuries inflicted 'by police' as cops use stun grenades to break up huge protests,1

A federal judge in Washington on Friday night halted a plan to release and put on house arrest the Arkansas man photographed sitting at a desk in House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's office during last week's riot at the U.S. Capitol.

Richard Barnett will instead be brought to Washington, D.C., immediately for proceedings in his case, Chief U.S. District Judge Beryl Howell ordered Friday night, staying a decision by another judge to confine Barnett to his home in Gravette, Arkansas, until his trial.

Howell's ruling came hours after U.S. Magistrate Judge Erin Wiedemann in Arkansas set a $5,000 bond for Barnett and ordered that a GPS monitor track his location. Wiedemann also prohibited Barnett from using the internet or having contact with anyone else who participated in the January 6 violence.

Barnett, 60, who has proudly referred to himself as a white nationalist on social media, was among supporters of President Donald Trump who stormed the Capitol as lawmakers assembled to certify President-elect Joe Biden´s victory over Trump.

Five people died during the violent insurrection, including a Capitol police officer. During a nearly five-hour hearing Friday via video conference, federal prosecutors had argued that Barnett should remain in custody.

'If (Barnett) will travel across the country and engage in this level of criminal behavior because he believes that he is right and it is the Electoral College that is wrong, what would deter him?' Assistant U.S. Attorney Kim Harris said.

Barnett is charged with unlawfully entering a restricted area with a lethal weapon - a stun gun.

Barnett is also charged with disorderly conduct and theft of public property. He faces up to 11 1/2 months in prison if convicted.

'I think your honor can shape a release order that provides a sufficient array of conditions that will allow my client to be released, that will allow my client to effectively defend himself and... will allow him to build enough of a `fence' around him that if he stumbles, it will be brought to your honor's attention almost immediately,' Anthony Siano, Barnett's attorney, told the judge during the hearing.

He surrendered voluntarily January 8 to FBI agents at the Benton County Sheriff´s Office in Bentonville, Arkansas, and has remained in the Washington County jail since then.

During Friday's hearing, prosecutors showed pictures of Barnett sitting at a desk in Pelosi's office and Capitol security video of him inside the building.

They also showed footage of him bragging on a bullhorn to a crowd outside the Capitol about taking an envelope from the speaker's office.

Prosecutors also cited concerns that Barnett had not turned over the stun gun or the cell phone he took with him to Washington.",House arrest plan for invader of Pelosi's office halted,1

As Donald Trump's supporters stormed the US Capitol on January 6 last year, Texas Senator Ted Cruz was in a supply closet urging his colleagues to overturn President Joe Biden's 2020 victory.

The Texas Republican made the revelations himself in a forthcoming memoir. Newsweek published an excerpt on Monday.

A former 2016 presidential primary opponent of Trump's, Cruz was among the first sitting lawmakers to pivot and get behind his explosive campaign. He was also one of six Republican senators who voted to overturn the 2020 election results.

The excerpt shows the moment Cruz first found out that the ex-president's supporters breached the Capitol, as lawmakers in both chambers were certifying Biden's win.

'Toward the end of our two-hour session, as Senator James Lankford from Oklahoma was speaking, there was a commotion from outside the [Senate] chamber,' the Texas senator wrote.

Vice President Mike Pence was then 'hastily escorted' out before the bicameral session was halted altogether, Cruz recalled.

'In the fog of the confusion, it was difficult to tell what exactly was happening. We were informed that a riot had broken out and that rioters were attempting to violently breach the Capitol building,' he wrote.

'At first, Capitol Police instructed us to remain on the Senate floor. And so we did. Then, a few minutes later, they instructed us to evacuate rapidly.'

He described tension within the area they evacuated to, with some colleagues 'blaming us explicitly for the violence that was occurring.'

'While we waited for the Capitol to be secured, I assembled our coalition in a back room (really, a supply closet with stacked chairs) to discuss what we should do next,' Cruz wrote. 'Several members of the group argued that in the face of the riot, we should suspend our objections and vote to certify the election. I understood the sentiment'

Americans got a sense of the high-stress circumstances lawmakers were under during the House January 6 Committee's most recent hearing, where the panel aired video of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer trying to coordinate security efforts from an undisclosed location.

But while Pelosi was phoning officials at the Pentagon and nearby governors for assistance, it appears that Cruz hid inside a 'supply closet with stacked chairs' to discuss the next move for him and other pro-Trump stalwarts.

'While we waited for the Capitol to be secured, I assembled our coalition in a back room (really, a supply closet with stacked chairs) to discuss what we should do next,' Cruz wrote.

'Several members of the group argued that in the face of the riot, we should suspend our objections and vote to certify the election. I understood the sentiment.'

But the Texas Republican said he 'vehemently disagreed' with legitimizing Biden's victory.

'I urged my colleagues that the course of action we were advocating was the right and principled one,' he wrote in the memoir.

The January 6 committee's video shows lawmakers getting word that they could return to the Capitol from then-Vice President Mike Pence.

He later voted against certifying the election anyway - and defended his stance during an interview on ABC's The View on Monday

Cruz equated Republican calls of election fraud with Democrat doubts about election access

Schumer and Pelosi are seen standing over a phone where Pence can be heard saying they can get back 'in roughly an hour.'

'Good news,' Schumer said. Pelosi added: 'Thank you very much, Mr. Vice President, for the good news.'

That evening, Cruz voted against certifying the 2020 election.

He defended the vote during an interview on The View on Monday, equating Republican objections to the 2020 vote to Hillary Clinton and Stacey Abrams' reluctance to accept the results of their elections.

When pressed about the fact that neither had incited a mob to march on the Capitol, Cruz pivoted to denouncing the nationwide racial protests that followed the murder of George Floyd by a white cop in 2020.

'There are a lot of folks in the media that try to, any time a Republican is in front of a TV camera, try to say, the election was fair and square and legitimate. Do you know who y'all don't do that to? Not Hillary Clinton who stood up and said, ""Trump stole the election."" Or Stacey Abrams who said the election was stolen,' Cruz said.

https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jan/24/south-wales-police-left-residents-unprotected-during-swansea-riot-mayhill,1,"A police force left residents “in danger, at risk and unprotected” for a “protracted period” during a riot in which cars were set on fire and bricks were hurled at houses, leaving people fearing for their lives, an independent review has concluded.

The chief constable of South Wales police, Jeremy Vaughan, apologised that his force had failed to act quickly enough during the disturbance in Swansea and accepted residents had been “tormented” by the rioters.

The independent review of the Mayhill disturbance, which happened in May 2021, highlighted that scores of officers were in the area but stood by, rather than tackling the rioters. It also said that one officer in charge that night twice asked for extra police to be scrambled from other areas as backup but was refused.

It highlighted one example of a vulnerable person whose life was feared to be in danger. Officers with shields were deployed but withdrew for their own safety, leaving the person and others like him “lost”, the report said.

It concluded: “Significant failings are evident. Currently available evidence strongly suggests failings in command structures and decisions, operational decisions and tactics, and communications.”

There were 46 arrests over the disturbance and the charging decisions by the Crown Prosecution Service on 37 people allegedly involved are expected imminently.

Vaughan said: “I want to apologise to all those who have been affected by this incident and particularly those local residents who were tormented by those responsible. We failed to take action quickly enough on the night and for that I am truly sorry.”

The review, undertaken by a former senior police officer, an ex-council chief executive and a barrister, said the impact of Covid lockdowns may have been one of the catalysts for the disturbance.

It said: “The adverse effects of the Covid-19 pandemic and consequent lockdowns have been identified throughout our engagements: these include impact upon the public and communities, disproportionate impact on children and young people, on policing, on the council’s work and engagements and upon partnership working between agencies.”

But it added: “However, no one has suggested to us that Covid was the sole or primary cause of the events.”

It calls for investment in the area – one of the most deprived in Wales – such as safe spaces, community activity and youth engagement, adding: “Identifying, supporting, and nurturing community capacity to generate positive action in sport, community events, social activity, youth engagement, etc. is a significant challenge, but an essential one.”

But the role of the police is the main focus of the report. “There was a protracted period during which the residents of Waun Wen Road [the centre of the violence] were in danger, at risk and unprotected by the police,” it said.

“Some of the views shared with us include the following: ‘The police let us down’; ‘They failed to protect us’; ‘They weren’t there for us when we needed them’; and ‘We don’t understand why they didn’t do anything.’”

The report says that up to 60 officers were on the streets, including some equipped with Tasers and with dogs, and that residents could not understand why they did not intervene. It said: “We have been unable to identify a clear command structure either properly identified or working in practice.”

The panel expressed concern over why a request for reinforcements under the force’s Operation Scorpion plan was twice refused. “There appear to have been breakdowns in communications that night,” the report said.

Examining the buildup, the panel said police had told it a vehicle had been obtained in advance, with a view to using it in the trouble. There was also a car chase involving the police shortly beforehand.

Swansea council said it was investing in the area, such as improving facilities for young people. “We will be further boosting our youth services and facilities in this area as part of our ongoing investment in our young people,” a spokesperson said.",South Wales police left residents ‘unprotected’ during Swansea riot,1
https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/sep/11/government-and-security-company-reach-multimillion-dollar-settlements-with-manus-island-guards,1,"A private security company and the federal government have spent tens of millions of dollars settling legal claims brought by Manus Island guards who were left physically or mentally damaged from riots at the detention centre.

Three more claims were settled last week, meaning 15 former guards employed by G4S have now been compensated in relation to the February 2014 riots which claimed the life of the asylum seeker Reza Berati.

Seventy-seven people were injured in the riots at the Papua New Guinea centre, including a person who was shot in the buttock and another who suffered a fractured skull.

The former guards claimed that G4S and the government were responsible for “catastrophic” failures in relation to the riots, including by inadequately training staff and not making personal protective equipment available to them.

The Victorian supreme court heard evidence last week from former guards, including one who said his mental state deteriorated so dramatically after the riot that he was unable to work and then became homeless, forcing him to live in his car.

Another former guard, Kerry Clifton, who settled her claim in 2020 but was giving evidence during the trial relating to three former colleagues, said that in the days leading up to the riot it became clear it was “getting a bit heated” because detainees had been told they would not be settled in Australia.

“One day, one of them said to me … when they slit my throat, that very first drop of blood would be very precious to them,” she told the court.

Troy Rivers, another former guard who also settled his case prior to last week, said the chaotic and terrifying riots continued to cause him nightmares, and he required ongoing mental health support more than eight years later.

“It has affected my mental health, I’m not the same,” Rivers told the Guardian. “Even last night [I] woke up a few times screaming.

“It’s a stain on Australia’s history.”

Kim Price, a partner at Arnold Thomas & Becker who represented the former guards, said that further details regarding the settlements – including the amount paid to individual guards – could not be released.

The settlements last week occurred only days into what was expected to be a weeks-long trial.

Price is also representing six more former guards.

“These further settlements reinforce the catastrophic and negligent failures by the commonwealth government and security firm G4S,” Price said.

Price is also taking legal action on behalf of two former guards against their previous law firms, Slater and Gordon and Maurice Blackburn, arguing that the firms were negligent in failing to commence proceedings on behalf of the guards within the six-year limitation.

“This means that these guards may not have the opportunity to seek compensation, even though their cases have merit,” Price said.

“These two individuals suffered intense trauma and have not worked since the riots.

“They are entitled to seek compensation for loss of earnings and pain and suffering, following the failures of the federal government and G4S to provide a safe workplace when riots took hold of the detention centre.”

https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/jul/01/trump-immunity-ruling-affect-criminal-cases,1,"The US supreme court’s decision on Monday to confer broad immunity to former presidents is likely to eviscerate numerous parts of the criminal prosecution against Donald Trump over his efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 election.

The court remanded the case back to the presiding US district judge Tanya Chutkan to apply a three-part test to decide which actions were protected – but Chief Justice John Roberts preemptively made clear that some were definitively out.

On some of the closer calls, Roberts also gave suggestions on behalf of the majority conservative opinion, which could bear on Chutkan when she eventually weighs each allegation line by line and decides whether it can be introduced in any future trial.

Most crucially for the special counsel, Jack Smith, his prosecutors will not be able to introduce as evidence any acts deemed to be official, even as contextual information for jurors to show Trump’s intent.

Trump is accused of overseeing a sprawling effort to subvert the results of the 2020 presidential election, including two counts of conspiring to obstruct the certification of the election results, conspiring to defraud the government and conspiring to disenfranchise voters.

The alleged illegal conduct came in five categories: Trump pressuring US justice department officials to open sham investigations into election fraud; Trump pressing his vice-president to return him to the White House; Trump trying to obstruct Congress from certifying the election; Trump giving a speech that led rioters to storm the US Capitol building and Trump’s plot to recruit fake electors .

Roberts undercut at least three of the five alleged categories in the opinion.

Trump’s interactions with justice department officials, including his threats to fire the then attorney general Jeffrey Rosen and the then acting deputy attorney general Richard Donoghue, were absolutely immune because overseeing the department was a core function, Roberts found.

As for Trump’s interactions with Pence, including pressuring him to reject electoral votes for Joe Biden in Congress on January 6, were presumptively immune because presidential discussions about vice-presidential responsibility were part of the job.

The remaining allegations, about Trump’s other attempts to obstruct Congress’s certification, Trump’s speech that led rioters to storm the US Capitol building, and his efforts to organize fake slates of electors in part by spreading false claims, were left up to Chutkan.

But even then, Roberts weighed in on a key conspiracy charge against Trump: obstruction of an official proceeding before Congress.

In the first footnote in the majority opinion, Roberts instructed Chutkan to apply the supreme court’s determination in a previous, related ruling about the applicability of the obstruction statute when prosecuting January 6-related crimes.

The ruling in Fischer v United States, handed down last week, held that the obstruction statute could only be used to prosecute crimes that impaired the integrity or the availability of documents.

The footnote appeared to be a clear warning to Chutkan that she could not use Trump calling up Republican members of Congress on January 6 and pressuring them to continue delaying the certification of the election results after the Capitol riot temporarily halted proceedings.

After all is said and done, prosecutors may be left with only Trump’s plot to recruit fake electors – which is in many ways a circumstantial case about the extent of his personal knowledge – Trump’s speech on January 6 and some private conversations.

The biggest blow to prosecutors may be the inability to present any of the official acts at trial, but the reasoning for it was not revolutionary.

In many ways, the new rule set by the supreme court that precluded evidence cannot be brought at trial, mirrored how federal courts apply other privilege protections, such as the speech and debate clause that makes acts by members of Congress done in an official capacity immune from prosecution.

Under the speech and debate clause, protected communications do not come into contextual evidence because they are litigated out during the criminal investigation stage on a line-by-line basis. They are never even presented to a grand jury when it considers indicting a defendant.",Immunity ruling likely to gut parts of criminal prosecution against Trump,1
https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2024/apr/16/sydney-church-stabbing-attack-firebrand-preacher-wakeley-ntwnfb,1,"At around 7pm on Monday night, a teenager wearing a black hoodie walked up to a bishop conducting a service in an Orthodox church in western Sydney, took out a knife and allegedly stabbed him repeatedly.

Between that moment and 12:34am when police issued a statement saying they had concluded their operation, the suburb of Wakeley descended into violent bedlam.

In the intervening five and a half hours, hundreds of people came to the streets around the church and a riot ensued in which two police officers were hospitalised with serious injuries. Paramedics were trapped inside the church for more than three hours and some came under direct threat from the crowd. An emergency council of religious leaders was called by the state’s premier, with the group calling for calm and unity, and bystanders were left terrified.

The alleged attack on bishop Mar Mari Emmanuel came at a powder keg moment in Sydney, still reeling from a horrific mass stabbing attack at a shopping centre in Bondi Junction in the city’s east two days before.

The circumstances of the incident – the particular church that was targeted, the nature of the service, the bishop in question, the spread of videos of the attack and aftermath and the existing tensions between the Assyrian Christian and Muslim communities in the area – were an almost perfectly combustible combination.

1:13 'It felt like something surreal': Wakeley community on Sydney church stabbing – video

‘Lucky to be alive’

The Assyrian Christ the Good Shepherd church was particularly full for a Monday night, witnesses say. It was holding a memorial service, marking the first anniversary of the death of a community member.

The church’s controversial but beloved bishop has a huge social media following and the service was being livestreamed on the church’s popular YouTube channel, which meant many people saw horrific video of the alleged attack, in real time or shared almost immediately.

The bishop and another clergyman were injured. Both were taken to hospital and were recovering well, though the New South Wales police commissioner, Karen Webb said, they were “lucky to be alive”.

Members of the congregation rushed the alleged attacker and pinned him to the ground while they waited for police to arrive. The alleged attacker severed his own finger during the attack, NSW premier Chris Minns said.

In a video shared in private WhatsApp groups and seen by Guardian Australia, the teenager, held on the ground of the church by a group of men, calls out in Arabic: “If he didn’t get himself involved in my religion, if he hadn’t spoken about my prophet, I wouldn’t have come here. If he just spoke about his own religion, I wouldn’t have come.”

Emmanuel has previously criticised Islam and the prophet Muhammad in sermons shared widely online. Emmanuel has 154,000 followers on Instagram and more than 25m views to his videos on TikTok.

To the community, the video of the alleged attack was proof it had been religiously targeted, something that the director general of Australia’s spy agency Asio confirmed the next day, when he declared it to be a “terrorist incident” that was religiously motivated.

Within an hour of the alleged attack, hundreds of people had filled the streets around the church.

“People moved to come to the church within five minutes,” said one Assyrian community member who did not wish to be named. “The boys were nervous, they were on edge, they heard so many rumours and were here to see what happened.”

The alleged assailant’s identity and ideology behind the attack has not yet been made public by police.

Maria*, a member of Emmanuel’s church, acknowledged tensions between the two communities.

“There are a lot of old wounds between these communities,” she said. “We have always felt something would happen.”

Meanwhile, leaders of Lakemba mosque in Sydney’s west revealed they had received threats to firebomb the mosque on Monday night. They planned to have heightened security over the next week.

A bishop with ‘huge resonance’

Emmanuel was known for being outspoken, posting firebrand sermons to social media in which he decried same-sex marriage, Covid vaccine mandates, transgender rights, as well as criticising Islam and directly appealing to Muslims to convert to Christianity.

“He’s very outspoken, very controversial,” said Father Daniel Ghabrial, principal of Santa Athanasius College, the University of Divinity, in Melbourne.

“He’s very far right, ultra conservative in some of those views – his views on same-sex relationships are very outspoken, his views on Islam are very outspoken and I understand that might have contributed to this. He’s a huge Trump supporter, he’s anti-vaccination, [he preaches that] Covid is a conspiracy.”

Emmanuel had parted ways with the official Assyrian orthodox church in around 2014, said Chorbishop Joseph Joseph , a priest who has known Emmanuel for about 40 years. Joseph worked closely with Emmanuel in the Ancient Church of the East, before Emmanuel left the mother church to form his own.

Joseph did not wish to say why Emmanuel had left the church, but confirmed it was to do with doctrinal issues, and that there were no allegations of wrongdoing against him.

When he knew him, Joseph said Emmanuel was “very normal, very humble, very nice”.

“Over 10 years he changed,” Joseph said. “For me, his preaching, I don’t know what’s happened, why he’s using this language. When he was in our church, he was [doing] very normal Christian orthodox preaching: talk about Jesus, we don’t mention other religions because everyone is free, especially in Australia, to choose his faith.”

Joseph said there is no excuse for the attack on Emmanuel. “First, he’s a human being,” he said. “We left our countries to come to this country, asking for freedom, asking to respect other people, we are shocked.”

While controversial – and schismatic – Emmanuel was also hugely popular and beloved among his community.

“People love him,” said Christian, a local Assyrian man who attends Christ the Good Shepherd and did not wish to give his surname. “He has helped so many people in our community and in every community. You have to understand, he has brought young people to the church, he has addressed social issues, he is on top of everything.”

“Sure, he is passionate and has spoken about Muslims and Islam previously, but he is just explaining his beliefs. Nothing can justify such an attack.”

Emmanuel’s anti-Covid vaccine, anti-lockdown stance also resonated with people in Wakeley, in light of the disproportionately harsh conditions faced by western Sydney during the city’s 2021 Covid lockdown.

This is a time to unite, not divide, as a community, and as a country Prime minister Anthony Albanese

Tighter restrictions on gathering and travel were in place for suburbs in the city’s west, which had helicopters flying overhead and armed forced on the streets to enforce the lockdown conditions – something that was particularly traumatic for refugee and migrant communities – while the rest of the city enjoyed laxer restrictions.

“I’ve seen some of his clips,” said Ghabrial. “He’s found a huge resonance.”

Tension lingers in Wakeley

NSW police said they deployed more than 100 officers to the scene in Wakely overnight, including riot police who moved the crowd on after police cars were smashed.

Multiple police were attacked and injured, including one hospitalised with a twisted knee and chipped tooth after being hit with a metal object, and another who sustained a broken jaw after being hit with a brick and a fence paling.

Police commissioner Webb said 20 police vehicles were damaged and 10 rendered unusable.

According to multiple witnesses, the violence against police flared after an incident in which a man holding an illuminated cross above his head was caught in a scuffle, leading to the cross falling.

“As soon as the cross hit the ground, people got even angrier, feeling as though their religion had been insulted,” Maria said. “So now, our Bishop has been attacked and our religion insulted. People are going to react the way they’re going to react.”

In a statement released in the early hours of Tuesday morning, Christ the Good Shepherd church said police had taken “necessary steps to disperse groups” after “numerous attempts by police … to peacefully disband visitors”. The church called on the community to adopt the “spirit of humility, love and peace”.

On Tuesday, the streets of Wakeley were again quiet, but tension remained.

The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, said: “This is a disturbing incident. There is no place for violence in our community. We’re a peace-loving nation. This is a time to unite, not divide, as a community, and as a country.”

Family members say he was suffering a mental health episode at the time

Police bodycam footage showing the fatal shooting of Walter Wallace Jr will be release by the end of next week, officials have confirmed.

Wallace, 27, was killed Monday while holding a knife during a confrontation with two police officers in West Philadelphia. His family said he suffered from bipolar disorder and was in a crisis at the time of the shooting.

City Mayor Jim Kenney released a statement Thursday night, which read: 'The Administration and the District Attorney expect BWC footage and 911 audio files to be released by the end of next week after certain matters are resolved in close consultation with Mr Wallace's family and their legal counsel.'

So far, only smartphone footage filmed by eyewitnesses has been seen by the public.

Wallace's family met with Police Commissioner Danielle Outlaw earlier in the day to view the bodycam footage.

After watching the videos the family say they won't be calling for the two officers involved to be charged with murder.

Wallace's family's lawyer, Shaka Johnson, says the footage clearly shows that the cops were 'improperly trained and did not have the proper equipment by which to effectuate their job.'

Wallace was shot a total of 14 times by the two officers after he failed to heed their orders to drop his knife. Neither officer was equipped with a Taser at the time, despite the fact the department had requested funding from the city to provide such devices.

Footage shot on a witness's smartphone shows the moment Wallace was fatally shot in West Philadelphia on Monday

Bodycam footage of the shooting reportedly shows Wallace emerging from a home along the 6100 block of Locust Street with a knife as his family members shout out 'he's mental, he's mental' to warn the officers of his condition.

Lawyer Shaka Johnson watched the video with the Wallace family on Thursday, and spoke about what he saw during a news conference.

'When Mr. Wallace comes out of the house, at least on this video we don't hear him say anything,' Johnson stated.

'It seems to be a person in sort of a cloud or a stupor or just not appreciating the gravity of that particular moment, which would align perfectly with what the family was shouting. He was behaving like a person who didn't appreciate the gravity of the circumstances,' he continued.

The two officers are heard giving 20 to 25 verbal warnings to Wallace to halt and 'drop his knife', before opening fire, according to FOX 29.

Johnson said he hoped the investigation into Wallace's death would lead to policing reform to prevent similar shootings from occurring in the near future.

He said the city failed the officers by not equipping them with less-lethal options, such as a Taser, to handle the situation.

'Those particular officers were only given a tool by which to assassinate,' he said.

In video captured by an eyewitness, Wallace walks towards the officers with his arm outstretched as one of the officers orders him to put the knife down

Both officers open fire, with at least seven shots heard. Wallace then collapses in the street as screams ring out and his mother runs over hysterically screaming 'no'

Johnson told reporters he has been in touch with District Attorney Larry Krasner and that his office is reviewing whether the officers will be charged with any crimes related to the shooting.

Both officers have been taken off street duty, pending the outcome of the DAs investigation.

The Wallace family says they believe a wrongful death occurred and a wrongful death suit will follow.

The shooting death of Wallace has prompted protests, riots, vandalism and looting across Philadelphia.

In the days since, more than 200 people have been arrested and about 50 police officers injured in clashes with protesters and vandals, including the 1,000 or so who suddenly swarmed a shopping center Tuesday night, breaking windows and stealing merchandise.

Family attorney Shaka Johnson said he did not think the officers should face murder charges and that he hoped the investigation into Wallace's death would lead to policing reform to prevent similar shootings from occurring in the near future. He is pictured on Thursday

Wallace's death is just the latest in a string of police killings of black men and women across America in recent months, with another black man shot dead outside a liquor store in San Bernardino just four days earlier.

The deadly shooting unfolded when the two officers responded to a domestic call around 4 p.m. in the predominantly black neighborhood in the city.

Footage captured by a bystander's smartphone begins with Wallace walking between parked cars outside the front of homes in the residential neighborhood.

A woman, later identified as his mother, is following him trying to get hold of him as shouts ring through the air.

Two officers have their guns pointing at him as he heads in the direction away from them.

'Yo this is crazy out here,' the person behind the camera is heard saying of the commotion.

The footage moves off Wallace to the cops with one in the road and another on the pavement a little way up the street.

The cops begin backing up as Wallace re-emerges in frame walking between other cars into the road toward them.

The officers continue to back away from him in the road, with their guns still drawn as Wallace walks toward the officers with his arm outstretched.

'Put the knife down, put the knife down,' one officer can be heard saying in the clip.

Wallace continues walking toward them and both officers open fire, with at least seven shots heard. Wallace then collapses in the street as screams ring out.

His mother runs over towards her son with her arms in the air, hysterically screaming 'no'. She then appears to throw something at one of the cops.

Several other bystanders also rush over with their arms in the air as one cop approaches Wallace's body while the other is seen speaking into his radio.

'My god! Oh my god,' the man recording the footage says.

'They just killed him in front of me! You really had to give him that many f***ing shots?'

Screaming is heard and Wallace's devastated mom is seen trying to hit one of the officers.

The footage pans round to down the road where two other cops are seen running toward the scene.

Police spokesperson Tanya Little said Wallace was hit in the shoulder and chest.

Wallace was then rushed to hospital in a police vehicle where he was pronounced dead soon after.

Wallace's mother later revealed she had called 911 three times prior the shooting, initially for an ambulance, warning them of her son's mental state.

Wallace's wife, Dominique, is pregnant and was scheduled to be induced on Wednesday, the family said.",Bodycam footage showing fatal police shooting of Walter Wallace Jr. will be released next week,1

Police declared yet another riot as some 300 BLM protesters joined in the demonstrations which have not abated since the death of George Floyd in May.

Last night they shouted Blake's name - an unarmed black man shot seven times in the back by a white office in Wisconsin on Sunday - as two fires were set against the wall's of the Portland Police Association building.

Someone climbed onto the association's roof to unfurl a banner and the walls were spray-painted with obscenities, such as 'F**k the police' and 'ACAB (All Cops Are B******s'.

The fresh violence comes as Marquise Love, 25, who is accused of kicking a man unconscious in the city last week, had his bail set at $260,000 on charges of assault, coercion and rioting.

He is alleged to have been among the mob who chased down and attacked Adam Haner after he crashed his truck in downtown Portland on August 16.

Marquise Love was taken into custody on Friday morning, accused of kicking Adam Haner during a BLM protest in Portland

Love turned himself in last week and will appear in court on September 2.

Last night police warned protesters to leave the area of the police association or face 'tear gas and impact weapons.'

Around 200 arrived in the residential area after marching from the Arbor Lodge Park.

Officers arrested several demonstrators and were able to disperse the crowds, setting up a chain-link fence around the police building.

Police said it was not immediately clear how much damage was done to the association building.

The night before police had used tear gas to scatter demonstrators who hurled rocks, bottles and commercial-grade fireworks at officers and set fires in the streets as they marched on a precinct station in another night of violence.

Footage from the scene showed a fire burning an awning at the north precinct late Sunday night and protesters chanting 'burn baby burn' while police tried to put out the flames with a fire extinguisher.

Twenty-three people were arrested.

Protesters had marched to the precinct from a park, chanting several things including 'Jacob Blake,' who was shot by a white police officer in Kenosha, Wisconsin, on Sunday night.

President Donald Trump's administration in July deployed federal forces to Portland to crack down on the protests.

On Friday, he denounced the demonstrations as 'crazy' and said cities run by Democrats had descended into chaos. Portland Mayor Ted Wheeler is a Democrat.

Portland police said last week that they had declared riots 17 times between May 29 and August 19.

https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-9167931/Joe-Biden-shows-real-power-lies-attends-mass-leaders-parties.html,1,"Joe Biden and Kamala Harris arrived at the Capitol Wednesday to be sworn in as president and vice president, walking up the steps to an inauguration unprecedented in history: the outgoing president absent, no crowd on the National Mall and 25,000 National Guard to secure them.

They entered the Capitol an hour and a half before they will be sworn in to become the 46th president and the first female vice president, Biden hand-in-hand with his wife Jill and Harris with her husband Douglas Emhoff.

At the same time, Donald and Melania Trump were in the air to Mar-a-Lago, turning their backs on their successors in a gesture unseen since 1869.

Trump had snubbed his successor repeatedly, then left D.C. with a tub-thumping speech pledging 'we will be back – in some form,' Air Force One taking off the to tune of My Way as he headed for Florida.

In contrast Biden set the stage for a dramatic change of tone from the start of Wednesday morning.

He went first to mass at St Matthew the Apostle Catholic Cathedral with Congressional leaders, a display of faith and party unity which also out on show that the new president, not the old, is the center of power in the city.

As Joe and Jill arrived with Kamala Harris and Doug Emhoff, three former presidents – George W. Bush, Barack Obama and Bill Clinton - were also arriving on the platform in another very pointed display of unity.

And Vice President Mike Pence's motorcade pulled up just before the president-elect's, showing his dramatic split from Trump in the final days in office. Precisely two weeks ago Pence was in the Capitol to certify Biden's victory – in the teeth of Trump's demands - as the MAGA mob stormed in, chanting 'Hang Mike Pence.'

The scene on the Capitol steps was choreographed to look as normal as possible but all around the signs of a country in multiple crises were unmistakable.

As well as intense security, masks were compulsory and chairs placed far apart to follow social-distancing guidelines, an acknowledgment of the more than 400,000 Americans killed by the COVID pandemic.

Biden, his wife Jill, and the top leaders of Congress had orchestrated a demonstration of faith and political power before he took the oath of office – attending mass with congressional leaders from both parties.

Biden and the powerbrokers who will help steer or stall his agenda joined for the service at the Cathedral of St. Matthew the Apostle, where funeral services were held for President John F. Kenned in 1963.

Vice President Mike Pence and his wife Karen Pence received applause when they walked onto the inauguration platform. Two weeks ago, Pence was pulled off the Senate floor as he presided over the certification of the election when a mob of Trump supporters swarmed the Capitol with some calling out 'Hang Mike.'

Former President George H.W. Bush shook Pence's hand when the vice president took his seat. Pence came to the inauguration to represent the Trump administration after President Donald Trump said he would not attend.

Hillary Clinton also greeted Pence warmly.

Guests on the inaugural platform on the West Front of the Capitol talked and mingled on the cold, Washington D.C. day while they waited for the ceremony to begin. It was windy and in the 40s. A light snow fell on the Capitol and waiting guests.

They wore face masks and bundled up against the cold in coats, gloves and scarves.

Former President Barack Obama walked around saying hello to guests, including baseball player Alex Rodriguez, the husband of Jennifer Lopez. Lopez is performing in the ceremony.

Obama also nodded to Pence. And he took a photo of Kamala Harris and Doug Emhoff when they walked by him as they entered the platform. Harris is the first female and African American vice president.

Most members of Supreme Court were there, including Trump-appointed justices Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett.

Pete Buttigieg, Biden's nominee for Transportation Secretary, was present as was his husband Chasten Buttigieg. Congresswoman Deb Haaland, Biden's nominee for interior secretary, was also there.

Several Republican lawmakers were in attendance, including some of President Trump's most ardent supporters – Senators Josh Hawley and Ted Cruz and Congressman Jim Jordan. Mitt Romney stood in the crowd. Former House Speaker Paul Ryan and former Vice President Dan Quayle were in attendance as was former Senator Jeff Flake.

Cindy McCain, the widow of the late Senator John Mccain, whose endorsement helped Biden win Arizona, was in attendance.

Democratic Rep. Terri Sewell of Alabama wore a face mask with the pink AKA logo, a reference to Alpha Kappa Alpha, which is Harris' sorority.

'I don't think snow was on my agenda until I walked out the door a moment,' Republican Senator Roy Blunt, the chairman of the joint inaugural committee, said in his remarks in a reference to the unusual security circumstances after the January 6th attack on the Capitol.

'I also want to thank the joint committee staff and our partners particularly our security partners for the way they've dealt with unprecedented circumstances,' Blunt said.

At Biden's Wednesday morning mass, he was joined by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, who said Tuesday that President Trump 'provoked' the crowd that ransacked the Capitol and has not said how he will vote on impeachment. Also joining was House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, who reportedly infuriated Trump with his remarks on the floor of the House where he blasted Trump's conduct but still voted not to impeach him.

McCarthy was one of the more than 100 House Republicans who voted to impeach Trump. 'The president bears responsibility for Wednesday's attack by mob rioters,' Mr. McCarthy said on the House floor Wednesday. 'What we saw last week was not the American way. Neither is the continued rhetoric that Joe Biden is not the legitimate president.'

He was also joined by Vice President-elect Kamala Harris, her husband Doug Emhoff and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who said Trump may have been an accessory to murder through his actions connected to the MAGA riot at the Capitol, and soon-to-be Senate Majority Leader Charles Schumer, who will oversee Trump's impeachment after he leaves.

His visit came just minutes after President Donald Trump departed the White House and stepped aboard Marine One for the last time – without engaging in any of the brash 'chopper talk' with the press that had become his trademark. Instead, the president flew to a staged rally on a military base where Ivanka Trump, son-in-law Jared Kushner other family members and other remaining supporters gathered. Laura Branigan's 'Gloria' was playing when Trump landed.

Biden will be the nation's second Catholic president. The cathedral is just blocks away from the White House – although getting there would require circumventing a massive security presence with fencing and members of the 25,000 strong National Guard force protecting the city.

The demonstration of unity – a prelude to what was set to occur at the West Front of the Capitol – separated the powerful lawmakers who remain from President Trump, who set up his own separate departure while skipping many of the traditional gestures of continuity. Trump didn't host Biden at the the White House; the first lady didn't host Dr. Jill Biden; Trump skipped the inauguration altogether and left Washington before Biden was to take office.

Biden and his wife, Dr. Jill Biden, departed Blair House across the street from the White House just after Trump wrapped up remarks to his family and supporters at Joint Base Andrews, telling them: 'Have a good life, we will see you soon.'

The Bidens traveled by motorcade to St. Matthews. He has regularly attended mass during the campaign and during the transition.

Biden wore a mask – as he seeks to mobilize Americans to mask-up for 100 days to try to stem the spread of infection.

Biden's act of ritual and supplication came after the Bidens and President-elect Kamala Harris and her husband Doug Emhoff on Tuesday attended a memorial to the 400,000 victims of the coronavirus at the Lincoln Memorial.

In the split-screen coverage of the transition brought on by Trump's failure to linger, while the Bidens were gathered inside the cathedral for mass, Air Force One took off with Trump's rally soundtrack playing Frank Sinatra's 'My Way.'

Donald Trump vowed 'we will be back - in some form' as he left Washington D.C. for the last time Wednesday, flying off on Air Force One to Mar-a-Lago to snub Joe Biden – then claiming credit in advance for the new administration's success.

'Have a good life,' he told a crowd of a few hundred supporters at Joint Base Andrews, after listing his 'achievements' in a speech which began after a 21-gun salute.

In the front row, Ivanka Trump cried, while behind the maskless crowd chanted 'thank you Trump,' before the first family climbed the stairs to Air Force One for the final time.

The military ceremony had the atmosphere of a Trump rally: Gloria was played as Air Force One taxied, and then the YMCA as Trump hugged and kissed his children.

'We love you. We will be back in some form,' he told the crowd of cheering supporters before signing off: 'Have a good life, we will see you soon.'

The farewell resembled one of Trump's infamous campaign rallies, ending with 'YMCA' – the song Trump would depart to – as supporters cheered 'USA, USA, USA.'

The president paused at times in his remarks. While he did not show tears, he appeared to feel the weight of the occasion while taking time to enjoy the final moments of his time in office. He notably did not mention the name of incoming President Joe Biden.

'Hail to Chief' played as Trump and Melania - who was wearing a Chanel jacket, sunglasses and carrying a $60,000 black crocodile Hermes Birkin bag - walked from Marine One to the platform where the president addressed the crowd.

'We love you,' the supporters yelled as Trump took the stage after arriving while his children watched on proudly.

'We accomplished a lot,' Trump said. 'We worked hard. We left it all - as the athletes would say - we left it in the field.'

Donald Trump left the White House on Marine One for the final time Wednesday, pumping his fist and giving a thumbs-up as he walked with Melania to the start of a new life.

The only people gathered outside to wish him goodbye were the press, to whom he briefly spoke to them before getting on board.

In a glaring split-screen moment defining the end of the Trump years, Joe Biden was about to leave Blair House, the White House's official guest house, to go to mass with his wife Jill and Congressional leaders.

Trump was flying to Joint Base Andrews to speak in front of Air Force One to a small crowd of supporters.

The pair stopped briefly to speak to the media before they boarded the helicopter with a stream of staffers hurrying behind them. Melania was dressed in all black and wore sunglasses.

Trump's early departure for Florida has caused a logistical and security nightmare since he is taking with him the nuclear codes. They will then be flown back to DC to be handed over to Biden this afternoon.

On Tuesday night, Trump made one of his final acts in office granting pardons to dozens of rappers, millionaires and strategists, including his old friend Steve Bannon.

As he makes his way to Florida on Wednesday morning, Biden will begin his day by attending mass with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. He will then watch stars including Jennifer Lopez and Lady Gaga serenade him on the Captiol before delivering his address to the nation and being sworn in.

This year, due to the ongoing pandemic and fears of a security threat, the mall - where thousands normally line up to greet the new President and First Lady - will be closed to the public.

A smaller-than-usual crowd of guests including former Presidents and lawmakers will attend the inauguration ceremony in a socially-distanced manner instead.

The inaugural theme for this year's ceremony, 'America United', aims to restore the 'soul of America', bring the nation together and create a 'path to a brighter future', according to the incoming administration.

The Presidential Inaugural Committee (PIC) has announced a series of events to be broadcast throughout Inauguration Day that Americans can watch live from home as people have been ordered to refrain from attending in person.

In lieu of the usual crowds, approximately 191,500 flags will cover the National Mall in honor of those unable to travel to Washington due to the pandemic.

Three hours before Biden will be sworn in as the 46th U.S. President, he will be attending mass at St. Matthew the Apostle Cathedral with members of the House and Senate at 8:45am.

Guests will then begin arriving on the steps of the Capitol at around 11am.

Because of the ongoing pandemic, organizers have slashed attendance from 200,000 down to just 1,000 people.

Most members of Congress are expected to be in attendance (and have all been permitted plus-ones), as are three of the four living former presidents: Barack Obama, George W. Bush and Bill Clinton.

Former first ladies Michelle Obama, Laura Bush, and Hillary Clinton, will also be present.

President Trump will not be attending.

He confirmed his absence in a tweet earlier this month shortly before he was permanently suspended from the social media platform.

Instead, Trump will leave DC on Air Force One at around 8am, with his destination set for his Mar-A-Lago resort in Florida.

He is set to become the first president in more than a century to not attend his successor's inauguration. Only three presidents have previously abstained, with the last, Andrew Johnson, coming in 1869.

Vice President Mike Pence, meanwhile, has confirmed he will be attending, along with his wife, Karen.

Vice President Mike Pence, meanwhile, has confirmed he will be attending, along with his wife, Karen.

The inauguration ceremony will commence with remarks from Father Leo J. O'Donovan, a longtime friend of the Biden family and former president of Georgetown University.

Andrea Hall, the first African American female firefighter to become captain of the Fire Rescue Department in South Fulton, Georgia, will then recite the Pledge of Allegiance.

A number of live performances are also scheduled to take place throughout the ceremony.

The first on the bill is Lady Gaga, who will sing the national anthem. The singer previously teamed with Biden on domestic violence issues during his two terms as Vice President and also campaigned for him in the 2020 election.

Amanda Gorman, who became the U.S.'s first Youth Poet Laureate in 2017, will then recite a poem she has written for the occasion, titled: 'The Hill We Climb.'

Much like the incoming president, Gorman also once had a speech impediment that she has worked hard to overcome.

She has also recently announced plans to run for president in 2036 – the first year in which she will be eligible.

Jennifer Lopez will then follow Gorman's reading with a song, as will singer-songwriter Garth Brooks.

The performances with then conclude with a benediction from longtime Biden family friend, Rev. Silvester Beaman, of Bethel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Wilmington, Delaware.

Chief Justice John Roberts will administer the oath of office to Biden shortly after the clock strikes noon.

Biden will take the oath with his hand on top of his 127-year-old, five-inch-thick family Bible, which will be held by his wife, Dr. Jill Biden.

Kamala Harris, the first woman, the first black and the first South Asian American vice president, will then take the oath immediately after.

Harris is due to be sworn in by Justice Sonia Sotomayor, the first Latina to serve on the bench of the Supreme Court.

Like Harris, Sotomayor is a former prosecutor. She previously administered the oath to Biden when he was sworn in for his second term as Vice President in 2013.

Harris will be sworn in on two Bibles — one that belonged to a close family friend named Regina Shelton and another that belonged to Thurgood Marshall, the country's first African American Supreme Court Justice.

Trump on Tuesday night granted sweeping pardons to his friends, rapper and millionaires, who have been charged for an array of crimes.

Trump PARDONS Steve Bannon: President grants clemency to 143 people including White House strategist who 'defrauded MAGA fans out of $25M', Lil Wayne, Kodak Black and convicted politicians

Donald Trump has granted clemency to Steve Bannon as part of a wave of 143 pardons and commutations announced early Wednesday morning during the president's final hours in office.

Bannon, 67, helped Trump win the election in 2016 and was a senior White House adviser. In August last year he pleaded not guilty to charges that he defrauded MAGA donors to 'We Build the Wall,' an online campaign that raised $25 million.

Pardoning Bannon in a list that dropped shortly after midnight the White House said: 'President Trump granted a full pardon to Stephen Bannon. Prosecutors pursued Mr. Bannon with charges related to fraud stemming from his involvement in a political project.

There were also no pardons for Trump relatives Scroll down for the full list Advertisement

Trump has also pardoned rappers Lil Wayne and Kodak Black who were prosecuted on federal weapons offenses, as well as former Detroit Mayor Kwame Kilpatrick, who was serving a 28-year prison term on corruption charges.

He will also pardon Elliott Broidy, a former top fundraiser for Trump who pleaded guilty last year to violating foreign lobbying laws, Ken Kurson, a friend of Trump son-in-law Jared Kushner who was charged last October with cyberstalking during a heated divorce and Anthony Levandowski, a former Google engineer was sentenced to 18 months in prison for stealing the internet giant's self-driving car files ahead of joining Uber.

But notable names not on the list were Wikileaks founder Julian Assange, Tiger King's Joe Exotic, Trump's personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani or any members of the Trump family, all of whom were rumored to be under consideration.

It also ended years of speculation that Trump would try to immunize himself, an unprecedented and legally questionable step which he had previously claimed he had the power to take.

The list was issued just hours before Trump leaves the White House for the last time and the pardon power, nuclear codes and other trappings of the presidency are transferred to Joe Biden, who will take the oath of office at noon Eastern time.

Leaving under the cloud of a second impeachment and the riot he provoked at the Capitol two weeks ago, Trump wished luck to the new administration in a 'farewell address' last night but did not mention Biden by name and still has not accepted in public that he legitimately lost the election.

Bannon had fallen out with Trump after he was quoted calling the president's son Don Jr. 'treasonous' and his daughter Ivanka 'dumb as a brick'. Trump said then: 'Steve Bannon has nothing to do with me or my presidency.'

But the two men have since rekindled their relationship as Trump sought support for his unproven claims of voter fraud, an official familiar with the situation said. White House officials are said to have advised Trump against pardoning Bannon.

Bannon can still be charged in state court in New York, where a pardon would not help him, said Daniel R. Alonso, a former prosecutor now at the Buckley law firm. Fraud prosecutions are frequently brought by the Manhattan District Attorney's Office, Alonso said.

'Steve Bannon is getting a pardon from Trump after defrauding Trump's own supporters into paying for a wall that Trump promised Mexico would pay for,' Democratic Rep. Adam Schiff said on Twitter. 'And if that all sounds crazy, that's because it is. Thank God we have only 12 more hours of this den of thieves.'

Bannon was in August last year pulled from a luxury yacht and arrested on allegations that he and three associates ripped off donors trying to fund a southern border wall.

The organizers of the 'We Build The Wall' group portrayed themselves as eager to help the president build a 'big beautiful' barrier along the U.S.-Mexico border, as he promised during the 2016 campaign.

They raised more than $25million from thousands of donors and pledged that 100% of the money would be used for the project.

But according to the criminal charges, much of the money never made it to the wall. Instead, it was used to line the pockets of group members, including Bannon, who served in Trump's White House and worked for his campaign.

He allegedly took over $1 million, using some to secretly pay co-defendant Brian Kolfage, an Air Force veteran who lost both legs in a mortar attack in Iraq and the founder of the project, and to cover hundreds of thousands of dollars in personal expenses.",Joe Biden shows where the real power lies as he attends mass with leaders from BOTH parties,1

The Black Lives Matter demonstrators crowd outside the White House on 1 June was a block away from the building and made no attempt to breach its security. It was a mostly Black crowd, and it was charged by a force made up of Washington police, US Park police, over 5,000 national guard troops and federal agencies like the Bureau of Prisons. An army helicopter swooped low over the heads of the protesters. Teargas, batons and horses were used to clear a block so that Donald Trump could stage a photo op outside a church across the road. A national guard commander later admitted there had been “excessive use of force”.

The events in Lafayette Park in June 2020 represented a defining moment of the Trump presidency. So will 6 January 2021. The mob that stormed the seat of US democracy on Wednesday had openly talked about such a plan, were explicitly intent on overturning a fair election, and some had hinted they might be carrying guns. They were almost all white. Many were openly white supremacists, and yet the thin Capitol police collapsed in their path.

The events in Lafayette Park in June 2020 represented a defining moment of the Trump presidency. So will 6 January 2021

It is unknown why there was not a greater show of force in front of the Capitol building, given all that was known about the plans of Trump’s supporters. In the summer, the national guard from several states parked armoured cars in the Washington streets and stood in full body armour in serried ranks on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial – all ahead of protests calling for the law to be upheld and an end to impunity for the police killing of Black Americans.

The deployment ahead of the 6 January riot was far lighter. After Washington’s mayor, Muriel Bowser, made a request, 340 guardsmen were activated in advance, of which 115 were on duty at any one time, mostly helping direct traffic. The DC and Virginia national guard were only deployed in significant numbers after the Capitol had been breached.

One big difference was that Trump was driving the deployment in June. He was silent on Wednesday, apparently unwilling to set troops on his own supporters. The New York Times reported he resisted calling out the national guard. The deployment was finally ordered by the acting secretary of defence, Christopher Miller.

Ivan Ferguson, 23, of Nevada, and Graham Evatt, 20, of Decatur, Georgia, were among those charged in the massive riots over the death of another protester who allegedly shot a police officer.

They have been charged with a slew of felony and misdemeanor charges — including domestic terrorism, first-degree arson and riot — but were granted a $355,000 bond on Monday.

Others arrested in the protests will remain in prison without bond as proceedings against them continue, FOX 5 Atlanta reports.

All six were detained after they allegedly set fire to a police cruiser in protest of the police-involved killing of Antifa activist Manuel Esteban Paez Teran, 26.

The protesters are demanding an investigation into his death, but the Georgia Bureau of Investigation insists he did have a gun on him at the time of the shooting on January 18 and was responsible for shooting a Georgia State trooper.

Violent protests erupted in Atlanta, Georgia following the police-involved killing of 26-year-old Manuel Esteban Paez Teran

Judge Ryan Locke ruled Monday that Ferguson, a classically-trained clarinetist who studied at the prestigious San Francisco Conservatory of Music with an address in Georgia, and Evatt — the only defendant from Georgia — could be granted bond, the Atlanta Journal-Constitution reports.

The two will now have a 24-hour curfew with the exception of school, work, meeting with their attorneys or attending a religious service.

They will also be required to wear an ankle monitor and will be forbidden from having weapons or being in contact with any of the other arrested suspects — the one exception being Nadja Geier, 24, from Nashville, Tennessee; with whom Ferguson is in a relationship.

The others arrested on Saturday for the violent protests at the site of a proposed Atlanta Public Safety Training Center were deemed to be too much of a flight risk to be granted bond, and will now remain in Fulton County jail until their next court appearances, which have not yet been scheduled.

They include Geier, Francis 'Frankie' Carroll, 22, from Kennebunkport, Maine; Madeleine Feola, 22, from Spokane, Washington; and Emily Murphy 37, from Grosse Ile, Michigan.

Authorities say the woke activists, dressed in black uniforms, collided with police in downtown Atlanta as they destroyed vehicles and property.

The protesters allegedly threw rocks and lit fireworks in front of the a skyscraper that houses the Atlanta Police Foundation, shattering its glass windows, before setting a police cruiser on fire and vandalizing walls with anti-police graffiti.

Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp said they are trying to 'import violence from other states'

A police statement said activists damaged property at several locations along Peachtree Street, a corridor of hotels and restaurants, adding that several arrests were made and 'order was quickly restored'.

Each of the protesters were charged with four misdemeanor charges including pedestrian in a roadway, willful obstruction of a law enforcement officer, riot and unlawful assembly.

Additionally, they were charged with felony counts including second-degree criminal damage, first-degree arson, interference with government property and domestic terrorism.

Their arrests indicate Antifa organizers are recruiting activists from across the country to commit violence in Atlanta. The violent thugs, several who were brought up in wealthy households, believe that police forces should be scrapped.

In a statement on Twitter Monday, Georgia Governor Brian Kemp said: 'Law enforcement demonstrated how quickly we shut down those trying to import violence from other states, and we'll continue to do so.'

Authorities say the protesters, dressed all in black, also threw rocks at a building that houses the Atlanta Police Foundation

The violence came during a 'night of rage' against police after the death of Manuel Esteban Paez Teran, who was shot dead by authorities after allegedly shooting and injuring an officer during an operation to clear protesters from the site.

Antifa members had been gathering at the site of the proposed $90million police training center, setting up camps in a woodland area around the training center in a bid to halt construction.

They argue that the proposed training facility — which they dubbed Cop City — represents Atlanta police becoming increasingly militarized and say the destruction of the forest will exacerbate climate change and lead to more pollution.

The proposal would cut out 381 acres of the Weelaunee Forest, which is currently owned by the state.

But extremists who call themselves the 'Forest Defenders' have become increasingly violent in recent weeks, throwing rocks and even Molotov cocktails at police and contractors at the site.

On January 18, Georgia state troopers and other law enforcement officials were conducting an operation to clear protesters from the site when they say Teran opened fire.

He allegedly shot and injured a state trooper at the scene, who is said to still be recovering from the gunshot wound, when officers fired back. Teran was pronounced dead at the scene.

Antifa protesters, though, have disputed this version of events, arguing authorities shot and killed Teran first.

But on Monday, the Georgia Bureau of Investigation sought to clear up any misconceptions — saying that Teran did, in fact, have a gun and shoot at the trooper.

It said the bureau received confirmation from a September 2020 firearms transaction record showing that Teran legally purchased the weapon used in the shooting.

Molotov cocktails were launched on Sunday night at the empty block which had been earmarked to become a temporary facility after the city confirmed six cases.

Among other ramped-up measures to reduce the risk of further infections, officials proposed using the building to house suspected victims, as well as front-line medical staff worried about infecting their families.

But dozens of angry local residents and protesters opposed to the measures set up roadblocks outside the complex before riot police moved in with tear gas.

In the evening, police said assailants threw petrol bombs at the buildings.

An AFP photographer on the scene saw fierce flames coming from the entrance of two apartment blocks before firefighters got the blaze under control.

Riot police were controlling the area and protesters had left, although some local residents were arguing with officers who used pepper spray.

The Centre for Health Protection said the plan to turn the housing estate into a quarantine zone would be suspended.

The agency has already turned a holiday park in an isolated rural area into a working quarantine facility. Two other holiday parks located away from major housing estates are also ready to be used as similar facilities.

But officials say they have struggled to find hotels and spare rooms for doctors and nurses working on the isolation wards where patients are being treated.

The virus outbreak comes at a time when Hong Kong is already boiling with widespread anti-government sentiment after seven months of often violent pro-democracy protests.

http://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/aug/27/belarus-protests-putin-ready-to-send-lukashenko-military-support,1,"Vladimir Putin has said the Kremlin is willing to provide military or other law enforcement assistance to the authoritarian leader of Belarus, Alexander Lukashenko, but added that the situation does not yet require it.

In remarks that will alarm EU leaders who have called on Lukashenko to negotiate with the opposition movement rather than try to crush it, Putin said he would send backup to Lukashenko if the standoff in Belarus escalated.

“[Lukashenko] asked me to form a certain reserve of law enforcement employees, and I have done so. But we also agreed that they would not be used unless the situation gets out of control,” Putin said in an interview for Russian state television.

Profile Who is Svetlana Tikhanovskaya? Show Born in 1982 in Mikashevichy, Belarus, Svetlana Tikhanovskaya rose to prominence as an opposition leader to Alexander Lukashenko, after her husband Siarhei Tsikhanouski, a popular YouTuber, was arrested while preparing to stand for election. After she announced her intention to run in his place, Belarusian authorities thought they could safely leave Tikhanovskaya on the 2020 election ballot to provide a window dressing of democratic competition. Instead, Tikhanovskaya emerged as a formidable opponent, describing herself not as a leader, but a symbol, and promising swift new elections if she attained power.

One of the “Chernobyl children” hosted in Ireland to help them recuperate from the effects of the nuclear accident in neighbouring Ukraine, as an opposition figure she drew crowds of thousands even in small cities, where people sang along to Changes, the 1987 song by the Soviet rock band Kino that became the soundtrack of a previous generation of people demanding a new kind of politics. Tikhanovskaya had sent her children out of Belarus during the campaign after she said she had received threats, and then in a video published days after she rejected the official result of the disputed election, a visibly distressed Tikhanovskaya indicated she had faced an ultimatum involving her family. She was forced to flee to neighbouring Lithuania. “God forbid you face the kind of choice that I faced,” she said. “Children are the most important thing in our lives.” The EU has answered Tikhanovskaya's call not to recognise the 2020 elections.

Putin gave no detail about the number of people involved or what kind of law enforcement agencies they came from. So far, Lukashenko has made extensive use of his own ranks of riot police as well as interior troops and certain special forces units.

Lukashenko has publicly asked Putin about the possibility of Russian military intervention in the country, painting the recent protests against his rule as part of a Nato plot to carve up Belarus.

On Thursday he accused neighbouring countries of beginning a “hybrid war” against Belarus, claiming Poland had plans to take over a chunk of its territory. Last week Lukashenko put the military on full combat alert on Belarus’s western borders.

So far it seems the Kremlin has not bought these claims, but Putin said Russia, which is technically part of a union state with Belarus, would “fulfil all of its obligations” if the situation changes.

“There is no need to make it a secret. There are relevant articles which say that all member states of these organisations, including the union state, should assist one another in the protection of sovereignty, external borders, and stability,” Putin said.

On Wednesday evening a plane used to transport top officials from Russia’s FSB security services landed in Minsk for the second time in a week. The Kremlin said it had no information about who was onboard or what sort of consultations might have taken place.

Poland’s prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki, issued a swift condemnation of Putin’s comments. “[The Polish] government urges Russia to immediately withdraw from plans of a military intervention in Belarus under false excuse of ‘restoring control’ – a hostile act, in breach of international law and human rights of Belarusian people, who should be free to decide their own fate,” he wrote on Twitter.

Lukashenko’s rigged election win and the violent crackdown on protests in its aftermath have led to him losing legitimacy among broad swathes of the population. An opposition council has been set up, aimed at starting negotiations on a transition of power, but authorities have opened a criminal case against it. This week they questioned several of its leaders, including the Nobel prize-winning author Svetlana Alexievich.

On Thursday Lukashenko said he was ready for dialogue with “labour collectives, student collectives … and farmers,” but not with the leaders of the protests. “Not the rogues who are committing outrages, roaming the streets and shouting that they want dialogue. They don’t want any dialogue. No one from the authorities is sitting down with street protesters,” he said according to the Belarusian state news agency.

The Kremlin has trodden a careful line in its response to events in Belarus, but it seems Putin has decided to back Lukashenko for now, offering economic support as well as potential boots on the ground. On Thursday Lukashenko said he had discussed with Putin the refinancing of $1bn of Belarusian debt to Russia, and an agreement could be ready soon. The Belarusian rouble has slid rapidly over the past week amid the political uncertainty.

'Because he's leading in the polls,' Trump Jr. told Newsmax anchor Rob Schmitt. 'Because they're afraid of him becoming president and dismantling the uni-party, dismantling the deep state. I don't believe in this level of coincidence anymore.'

Donald Trump was indicted on felony charges Tuesday for working to overturn the results of the 2020 election, with the Justice Department acting to hold him accountable for an unprecedented effort to block the peaceful transfer of presidential power and threaten American democracy.

The four-count indictment, the third criminal case against Trump in recent months, provided deeper insight into a dark moment that has already been the subject of exhaustive federal investigations and captivating public hearings.

But the Trump campaign labelled the charges fake, and asked why it took the Justice Department two-and-a-half years to bring them.

Donald Trump Jr. has hit out at the indictment of his father on charges related to the Jan 6, 2021 attack on the Capitol in an interview with Newsmax

Former US president Donald Trump arrives ahead of his arraignment at the Manhattan Criminal Court in New York on April 4, 2023. He was indicted on August 1, 2023 over his efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 election

Trump Jr went on to point out that each of Donald Trump's three indictments were brought in close proximity to damaging revelations pertaining to President Biden's son Hunter, declaring: 'We're living in a banana republic!'

The sentiment echoes that of enraged Republicans who labelled the third indictment of Trump a 'witch hunt' conveniently timed to come down one day after Devon Archer testified about the Biden family business deals.

'Less than 24 hours ago, Congress heard testimony from Hunter Biden's longtime business partner that Joe Biden joined Hunter's business calls over 20 times,' said GOP Conference Chair Elise Stefanik.

'Today's sham indictment of Donald Trump is yet another desperate attempt to distract attention away from the mounting evidence of Joe Biden's direct involvement in his family's illegal influence peddling scheme.'

Even in a year of rapid-succession legal reckonings for Trump, Tuesday's indictment, with charges including conspiring to defraud the United States government that he once led, was stunning in its allegations that a former president assaulted the 'bedrock function' of democracy.

It's the first time the defeated president, who is the early front-runner for next year's Republican presidential nomination, is facing legal consequences for his ultimately failed effort to cling to power.

'The attack on our nation's Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, was an unprecedented assault on the seat of American democracy,' said Justice Department special counsel Jack Smith, whose office has spent months investigating Trump.

'It was fueled by lies, lies by the defendant targeted at obstructing a bedrock function of the U.S. government: the nation's process of collecting counting and certifying the results of the presidential election.'

Due to the 'dishonesty, fraud and deceit' by Trump and some of his closest allies, the indictment says, his supporters 'violently attacked the Capitol and halted the proceeding.'

Trump has said he did nothing wrong and has accused Smith and the Justice Department of trying to harm his 2024 campaign.

It comes as the judge appointed to oversee the former President's latest criminal case was revealed as DC federal Judge Tanya Chutkan, who was declared 'the toughest punisher' of rioters charged with offenses relating to Jan. 6, and worked at a law firm associated with Hunter Biden.

In a profile by the Associated Press, written last year, it said: 'Chutkan has handed out tougher sentences than the [Justice Department] was seeking in seven cases, matched its requests in four others and sent all 11 riot defendants who have come before her behind bars.'

The article, titled 'In Jan. 6 cases, 1 judge stands out as the toughest punisher', continues: 'In the four cases in which prosecutors did not seek jail time, Chutkan gave terms ranging from 14 days to 45 days.'

The AP article continued that Chutkan jailed, despite prosecutors not asking for it, 'an Ohio couple who climbed through a broken window of the U.S. Capitol.'

The 61-year-old, nominated by former President Barack Obama, was born in Jamaica and graduated from the University of Pennsylvania's law school.

Chutkan worked at the law firm Boies Schiller Flexner from 2002 until she was confirmed a federal judge in 2014.

The DNC was hosting a Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee candidate event when protesters with IfNotNow and other left-wing pro-Palestinian groups starting violently demonstrating outside the building and clashing with law enforcement.

House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, Minority Whip Katherine Clark, Democratic Caucus Chairman Pete Aguilar and DCCC Chair Suzane DelBene released a joint statement claiming the DNC protesters 'escalated their activity in a manner that exceeded a peaceful demonstration.'

'We strongly support the First Amendment right to freedom of expression and encourage anyone exercising that right to do so peacefully,' the Democrat leaders wrote.

IfNotNow's national spokesperson said 'the goal was just to block the door in non-violent civil disobedience.'

But a House Democrat who was present at the DNC, along with Jeffries and other leaders, told Axios: 'It scared me more than January 6.'

Another wrote on X, formerly Twitter, that the violence exhibited was a surefire way to make sure Republicans are voted into office in the next election.

The comparison to January 6 is a strong one considering participants who rioted at the Capitol are still faces legal repercussions and former President Donald Trump continues to face lawsuits over whether he engaged in an insurrection that day.

The violence comes as Americans continue to clash over the war between Israel and Hamas terrorists based in the Palestinian enclave of Gaza.

The U.S. Capitol Police released a statement Thursday morning claiming six of their officers were treated for injuries – including a female officer punched in the face by a 24-year-old man who was arrested for assault of a police officer

Pro-Israel groups claim that pro-Palestinian groups want to wipe Israel – and Jewish people – off the map. While Pro-Palestinian activists claim that Jewish people wrongfully 'occupy' the land that is internationally recognized as Israel.

Hamas, the de facto government of Gaza, launched terrorist attacks on Israel on October 7 that led to the largest single-day massacre of Jewish people since the Holocaust. Since then, Israel has carried out counterstrikes against Gaza that have resulted in thousands of Palestinian deaths.

Besides a few progressive lawmakers, most Republicans and Democrats in Congress have rallied around Israel and its right to defend itself against terrorists.

Pro-Palestinian activists say this is unacceptable and are lashing out against even Democrat lawmakers for not demanding a ceasefire.

Among those present at the DNC event during the clashes on Wednesday were Democratic leaders, including House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, and Rep. Brad Sherman (D-Calif.).

Jeffries was part of the group of bipartisan lawmakers who spoke at the pro-Israel March in Washington, D.C. on Tuesday.

Sherman wrote on X of the violence: 'Apparently, these pro-Hamas demonstrators want Republicans to prevail in the next Congressional election.'

He detailed: 'Was just evacuated from the DNC after pro-terrorist, anti-Israel protestors grew violent, pepper spraying police officers and attempting to break into the building.'

'Thankful to the police officers who stopped them and for helping me and my colleagues get out safely,' Rep. Sherman added.

USCP said that violent demonstrators were using bike racks to attack law enforcement, which included members of the US Capitol Police as members of Congress were inside DNC headquarters for an event on Wednesday

Violence broke out as the DNC was hosting a Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee candidate event with congressional leaders, including House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (pictured at the Capitol on Wednesday, November 15 before the violent clashes)

Shortly after protesters organized outside the DNC building in Washington, DC, the scene quickly turned violent when law enforcement, which included US Capitol Police officers, told the demonstrators to move back from the building where lawmakers were currently gathered.

Eva Borgwardt, IfNotNow national spokesperson, said that when the pro-Palestinian groups refused to comply with police orders, it prompted 'the most brutal police response I have ever seen.'

The lawmaker who spoke to Axios detailed that they were about to leave the DNC Headquarters and return to the Capitol when police told them not to exit.

'Someone sent out word for people to come [back] and police said it's not safe,' the lawmaker said. 'Police were wearing gas masks ... this was not peaceful.'

The images and videos outside the building just three blocks from the U.S. Capitol quickly went viral as protesters were seen targeting law enforcement, hitting them with pepper spray, bike racks and fists.

US Capitol Police (USCP) released a statement Thursday morning that six officers were treated for injuries – including one female officer who was punched in the face by a 24-year-old male protester from New York who was arrested for assaulting a police officer.

IfNotNow, which led the protest, released their own statement Thursday claiming more than 90 of their protesters were injured in the clashes.

House Speaker Mike Johnson condemned the attack on DNC Headquarters by 'pro-Hamas protesters.'

'As Americans, we must unite with one voice in steadfast support of our ally Israel,' he wrote in a statement. 'I want to thank the officers with the U.S. Capitol Police who worked quickly to evacuate members, staff and civilians and arrest those engaged in violence.'

https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/jun/13/nsw-police-officer-appears-to-make-white-power-salute-near-sydney-black-lives-matter-protest,1,"Attendees of Friday night’s Black Lives Matter protests in Sydney say they were left terrified after an officer appeared to flash a hand symbol associated with the white power movement.

Black Lives Matter protesters gathered in the Sydney CBD to draw attention to Australia’s record on Indigenous deaths in custody.

Protester Jen Atherton filmed the video after the group was moved out of Hyde park by dozens of police officers and both parties made their way to Town Hall.

“It was just really shocking,” Atherton said.

The symbol is extremely similar to the “OK” hand gesture but has been used by white power movements in recent years.

“You can’t really ever confirm but … I don’t see why he would be saying everything was OK in that moment,” Atherton said.

NSW police have denied the gesture was in any way related to the white power movement.

“The officer has been spoken to and did not intentionally make a gesture that could be deemed offensive,” a spokeswoman said in a statement.



“Further, the officer indicated he was responding to a group of women about the night being ‘OK’ and used a hand symbol as he was wearing a face mask. He did not know the gesture had any other meaning.



“The NSW police force works closely to foster a strong and cohesive partnership with Aboriginal communities and other groups and does not appreciate irresponsible inflammatory commentary in this space.”

Atherton did not accept the police’s account of events.

“I don’t believe it for a second. It was directly to the camera and I was clearly a protester.”

The video was taken at the corner of Pitt and Park St in the CBD.

More than 600 officers flooded the CBD on Friday night as about 300 people protested against Aboriginal deaths in custody.

One of the rally’s organisers, Lizzy Jarrett, described the police presence as “ridiculous”.

The mother of David Dungay Jr and family members of other Indigenous people who had died in custody were meant to speak at the rally, but Jarrett said there were too many police.

“There was wall to wall to wall of riot police cornering off all of Town Hall,” she said. “If you are a mother or a family member or an elder who has been affected by black deaths in custody, that kind of police presence is traumatising before you even have a chance to stand up for yourself.”

Jarrett told protesters to disperse once the police presence got too high.

“I made sure the crowd realised that if one of us was arrested that’s a loss,” she said. “I said no arrests tonight, let’s not let them win. Let’s all go home, let’s have no violence, let’s not wake up to headlines that we are the ones out there being violent, that we are the ones out there being disruptive when we know the truth of the matter.”

During the rally, police on foot and horseback ringed the statue of Captain Cook in Hyde Park, fearing it could be vandalised.

“It was a joke, I don’t believe there was a person amongst us that didn’t laugh about it, we are out there protesting for life yet you are going to put two rings of men around a piece of concrete,” Jarrett said.

Jarrett said she and other organisers were eventually escorted by police five blocks away from the protest.

Analysis by MailOnline suggests that in a worst-case scenario around six million adults could be in isolation by the end of the month.

Ministers were warned that factories could be forced to start closing today and consumers could see shortages of some foods because there are not enough staff to carry out key functions amid skyrocketing coronavirus infection rates.

Office for National Statistics (ONS) data released this morning estimated the number of people infected with the virus in the week ending July 10 was 577,700, up 73.5 per cent in just a week. One in 95 people in England had Covid last week according to the official data based on thousands of swab tests.

It comes as official figures revealed that as many as 5,200 military personnel were absent from duties because they were self-isolating under coronavirus rules, while a quarter of staff are yet to receive a vaccine.

The revelation led to increased calls on Friday for the Government to take 'urgent action' by changing quarantine rules as restrictions are relaxed in England and infections rise.

Meanwhile, Britain's daily infection toll breached 50,000 today for the first time since January. Anyone who tests positive is told to self-isolate and has their contacts traced.

But because the Bluetooth phone app 'pings' all those who have been in close contact with positive cases, the number of people self-isolating at home at any one time is far higher.

Unlike those people contacted by phone, it is not a legal requirement to self-isolate after being pinged by the app. But Downing Street today made it clear it expects people to do so.

It raises the prospect of the economy grinding to a halt due to a chronic lack of available workers, even after the lockdown is supposed to have ended on Monday.

Business leaders and trade unionists from across all sector of the economy lined up to warn the Government that a major rethink is needed today, because the current situation is not sustainable. A fifth of all private sector workers are currently having to self-isolate, according to industrial analysis.

Meat workers are in talks with the government about emergency exemptions for their workers who are pinged by the app – but as of this afternoon no deal had been announced.

There were also a series of warning from NHS representatives who warned that the pingdemic is taking a toll on medical services across the country - with one trust asking staff to postpone their holidays.

But ministers and Downing Street rebuffed them, insisting the app was vital and would not be removed until the middle of next month.

Solicitor General Minister Lucy Frazer admitted the Government recognises the 'significant impact' it is having, but said it remained an 'important tool' in the fight against Covid-19.

Downing Street also declined to confirm reports that workers in vital industries like food preparation and butchery could get exemptions planned for NHS workers.

Up to 1million people were asked to self-isolate last week, data suggests. But that figure could hit 5.6million by the end of the month, if cases spiral by 75 per cent every week (right), according to MailOnline analysis. Separate projections based on a growth rate of 40 per cent - similar to what Test and Trace reported last week - still says the number of people self-isolating could hit 3million a week. But the true figure will be much lower because many people who are told to self-isolate end up testing positive, and some people will be flagged down by both NHS Test and Trace and the app

Around 1.8million people were asked to self-isolate last week in England, data suggests. That includes 194,000 people who tested positive, 520,000 who were 'pinged' by the app, almost 340,000 who were contacted directly by Test and Trace, and 750,000 schoolchildren

NHS England data showed a record 520,000 alerts were sent by the app last week, telling people they had been in close contact with someone who tested positive

And the number of alerts sent out in relation to venues also more than doubled in seven days

Four fifths of NHS hospitals in England are now seeing a spike in Covid patients being admitted, official data has shown as the third wave of the pandemic continues to take its toll ahead of 'Freedom Day' on Monday

In a more positive sign, SAGE today estimated England's R rate is between 1.2 and 1.4, down from last week's figure of between 1.2 and 1.5

Why it's NOT illegal to ignore being 'pinged' MailOnline has looked into the legal guidance behind whether someone has to self-isolate if they are Covid positive, or told to by the app or Test and Trace. Do I have to self-isolate if I get 'pinged' by the app? App users who are 'pinged' after coming into contact with someone who has tested positive are not obliged to stay at home. They are kept anonymous through the app, meaning authorities are unable to track them down if they have been told to quarantine. Professor Lilian Edwards, a top lawyer who advised the Government on the app, said today people do not have to follow notifications from the software. 'I think what's getting lost in the traffic here is that you are not breaking the law if you do not self-isolate having been pinged by the app,' she told the BBC's World at One. The Health Protection (Coronavirus, Restrictions) (Self-Isolation) (England) Regulations 2020 says people alerted by the app do not have to self-isolate (bolded in red) 'You are only breaking the law if you are rung up by a manual contact tracer. 'Therefore, there is room there for discretion both from managers in the workplace and from workers as to whether they think they are a risk.' However, the instruction becomes legally enforceable as soon as someone who is pinged attempts to apply for the Government's isolation support payments. Do I have to self-isolate if test and trace contacts me? People contacted by NHS Test and Trace workers do have to self-isolate under regulations brought in last autumn to tackle coronavirus or face hefty fines. That rule won't be dropped for fully vaccinated adults until August 16. Britons who are contacted by test and trace must self-isolate at home for ten days. They must isolate for ten days regardless of whether they have symptoms or get a negative test. People they live with will also be required to self-isolate for ten days. Do I have to self-isolate if I test positive? People who have received a positive test must isolate for ten days after displaying symptoms or their test date if they do not have symptoms, while members of their household must isolate for 14 days Britons found breaking these rules could face a fine of £1,000 for the first offence. This rises to £10,000 for people who repeatedly refuse to self-isolate after testing positive. Advertisement

It came as:

One in 95 in England had Covid last week, official data has shown amid warnings from ministers that the country will face another lockdown the wave doesn't stop spiralling soon;

Official figures released today show the contact-tracing app sent out 520,000 self-isolation alerts last week;

Councils raised concerns over bin collections after Leeds, Bristol and Rochdale were forced to leave resident's rubbish on the curbside after the app forced workers to stay at home;

O fficial figures revealed that as few as 30 per cent of adults have been double-jabbed in inner cities;

Ministers were urged to get a grip on the Covid travel test fiasco that has led to lengthy delays and appalling service.

The MailOnline analysis is based on the 75 per cent growth rate in confirmed Covid cases continuing for the next three weeks.

Other surveillance measures, however, say the outbreak is growing slower, including one symptom-tracking app that believes the outbreak has already peaked.

The rise in positive cases is mirrored with a similar increase in the number of people having to isolate after being pinged as a close associate, according to this website's projections.

Up to 1million people were asked to self-isolate last week, data suggests.

But that figure could hit 5.6million by the end of the month, if cases spiral by 75 per cent every week.

Thousands of people who are pinged also go on to become confirmed cases, meaning the total will be lower. And some people will be flagged down by both NHS Test and Trace and the app.

In addition, if enough people self-isolate, the rate of infection could drop, scientists say.

A lower estimate by the Adam Smith Institute projects a figure of around 2million people.

The app's maker last night told the Financial Times it was functioning as it should.

Wolfgang Emmerich, chief executive of Swiss firm Zühlke UK said it was 'doing exactly what we designed it to do', and increased notifications were 'a reflection of the increases in infection numbers rather than any change in the app'.

Nissan was among businesses that have flagged serious issues, after around 900 workers at its flagship plant in Sunderland were forced to isolate after they were pinged by the app.

Meanwhile, as many as 5,200 military personnel were absent from duties because they were self-isolating under coronavirus rules, while a quarter of staff are yet to receive a vaccine, official figures show.

Ministers are planning to exempt the fully-vaccinated from quarantining over close contacts but will not introduce the change until August 16, around a month after most restrictions end.

Ministry of Defence figures show 5,200 regular and reservist armed forces personnel were reported absent from work due to self-isolation over infection or as close contacts on July 1.

That is nearly 3 per cent of the 198,000 personnel available to the Army, Navy and Air Force.

The figures also showed that there was no record of around a quarter of personnel - 54,742 - having received a coronavirus vaccine as of July 5.

Tobias Ellwood, the Conservative MP who chairs the Commons Defence Committee, warned that national security could be endangered if the figure continues to rise to 10%.

Last night Unite's Steve Bush told Newsnight: 'I believe we're hours not days or weeks away from our first temporary closure of sites.'

And the Meat Processors Association chief executive said abattoirs would have to 'rationalise' product lines, stopping those requiring the most butchery, in order to keep food on shelves.

Nick Allen told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: 'We were struggling with skilled labour anyway, and now on top of this you have got them being pinged and told to stay at home for 10 days.

'So it's quite a critical point and it is not really a numbers game. It's if you get critical people in the production line pinged and having to stay at home that can cause as much of a problem as sheer numbers.'

The Royal College of Anaesthetists and the Faculty of Intensive Care Medicine issued a joint call to exempt double-jabbed NHS staff from isolation over close contacts.

Sir Jonathan Montgomery, the former chair of the ethics advisory board for the NHS Test and Trace app, said while he would not change the function of being 'pinged' by the app the 'consequences' needed to be updated.

But Ms Frazer said firms would have to wait until August 16 for the isolation requirement to go.

'It (the app) is an important tool because it is important that you do isolate if you do come into contact (with a positive case), but I know this is something the Government is looking at,' she told Sky News.

'In addition to the changes in mid-August, the Government is also carrying out a number of pilots to see whether instead of isolating when you get pinged, you could take a test.

'The Government is looking at this very carefully, recognising the significant impact this is having on businesses.'

No 10 said those contacted by the NHS Covid app to self-isolate should follow the guidance, amid calls from some employers for 'pinged' staff who test negative to be allowed to continue to go to work.

Asked about employers calling for those testing negative to break their self-isolation, a spokesman for the Prime Minister said: 'We are asking people who are contacted by the app to continue to isolate, that's what we've asked people to do since the app was launched.

'The reason for that is not just to protect themselves but also to try and break the chain of transmission to other people that they may come into contact with.'

On the rise in cases of people being sent alerts by the app, the No 10 official said: 'The Prime Minister spoke about the fact that we are seeing case numbers increase, and obviously as a result you would expect to see the numbers of people being notified to self-isolate increase also.'

The spokesman said he would 'not speculate' on whether the Government had predictions for how many people could be asked to quarantine at the peak of the current wave of infections.

It came as health bosses in Sunderland asked staff to postpone holidays as the trust came 'under extreme pressure' due to a surge in coronavirus cases.

Staff at South Tyneside and Sunderland NHS Foundation Trust - dealing with one of the highest infection rates in the country - are seeing hospital cases doubling week-on-week.

In an internal note to staff earlier this week, bosses said there were 80 Covid-19 patients receiving hospital treatment compared with just two exactly a month before.

Chris Hopson, the chief executive of NHS Providers, said the hospital trusts the organisation represents are increasingly concerned over dealing with the care backlog 'with large numbers of staff unable to work'.

'We know that national leaders are working hard to find a solution to this problem. The key is that this solution is delivered as a matter of urgency,' he added.

Britain WILL 'of course' face a new lockdown if Covid third wave hits 'unacceptable' levels of hospitalisation Britain will 'of course' face a new lockdown if Covid's third wave hits 'unacceptable' levels, a minister warned today after Chris Whitty admitted the country may have to face new restrictions within weeks. Solicitor General Lucy Frazer suggested it was the right time to open up because of the vaccination drive — which has reached 90 per cent of Britons. But with cases continuing to soar, hospital admissions tracking above some of SAGE's worst-case projections, and deaths having hit a four-month high, she warned that No10 may be left with no choice but to consider reimposing tough restrictions. Ms Frazer said: 'Of course, if we get into a situation where it is unacceptable and we do need to put back further restrictions, then that of course is something the Government will look at.' England's chief medical officer last night cautioned the UK could still 'get into trouble again surprisingly fast' and hospitals may face 'scary numbers' within a matter of weeks. Making it clear the country was not on an irreversible path to freedom despite No10 pushing ahead with step four of the roadmap to normality on Monday, Professor Chris Whitty said: 'We are not by any means out of the woods yet.' Boris Johnson has already dropped all mention of the final unlocking being 'irreversible'. The Prime Minister has resorted to caution, calling on people not to 'go wild' and immediately rush to take advantage of the final easing — which includes lifting work-at-home orders and reopening nightclubs. Cases have spiralled over the past few weeks, with scientists blaming the easing of restrictions and young men gathering to watch England's Euro 2020 campaign for the uptick. Vaccines have already saved thousands of lives since the third wave began, drastically slashing the proportion of infected patients who are left seriously ill. But jabs aren't perfect, and admissions have been tracking upwards for a fortnight. Almost 560 infected patients are being admitted to NHS wards each day now, compared to fewer than 100 before the Indian Delta variant took off in mid-May. The current trend in figures is above some of the gloomiest estimates from SAGE, who warned hospitalisations could breach 4,000 a day in August. It comes after health chiefs yesterday posted another 63 deaths, in the highest daily rise since March, and 48,553 cases. Advertisement

Test and Trace app pings neighbours through walls if their phones are too close despite the people having NO face-to-face contact The NHS Test and Trace app is 'pinging' neighbours through walls if their phones are in close proximity to each other, it was claimed last night. Neighbours are being forced into quarantine for ten days despite never coming into contact with a positive case of the virus because the bluetooth signal used by the app is known to be strong enough to penetrate walls. This means the technology will occasionally send an order to quarantine to people because their next-door neighbour – with whom they share a wall – may have tested positive, sources told The Telegraph. Sources have said issues concerning the sensitivity of the app were raised when it was initially created and are now in the process of being tweaked. A source told the Daily Telegraph: 'We are hearing of anecdotal cases and we do know that it is possible for the signal to travel through walls, although it is weakened.' Dr Fiona Sampson, a senior research fellow in emergency and urgent care at the University of Sheffield, told The Daily Telegraph: 'My partner got pinged and rang 111 to find out when the contact was. However, he hadn't left the house on the day of the alleged contact. 'We later realised he had been working with his phone on the table, less than two metres away from our neighbour.' Meanwhile Jason Delaney, 39, a bar owner from Alton, Hampshire, told the newspaper he too was informed he had come into contact with a Covid case despite not having met with anyone on the day in question. NHS guidance says the app's bluetooth signal is reduced through walls but not blocked entirely, with people on the other side 'less likely' to receive an alert. A Government spokesman said the number of people 'pinged' through walls was not large enough to be considered 'an issue', adding: 'But we wouldn't say that this never happens.' Advertisement

In the private sector, Stephen Phipson, chief executive of manufacturing organisation Make UK, said: 'This is a problem that has escalated significantly over the last week with more and more companies being affected by isolation, with not just an impact on production but a hit to actual shipments of goods going overseas.

'This is an increasingly serious issue affecting companies of all sizes and sectors. There is now an urgent priority for Government to bring forward the August date given the likely impact of restrictions being lifted next week.'

Rail, Maritime and Transport union (RMT) general secretary Mick Lynch warned that Monday 'will see a surge in workers pinged with a self-isolation instruction next week'.

'Even at this late stage, the Government, the train operators and the bus companies should issue a clear, legally backed instruction that levels up the rest of the UK to the safety standards that will remain in force in Wales and Scotland,' he added.

Frances O'Grady, general secretary of the TUC, said: 'Staff shortages will only get worse unless people are kept safe at work.

'The Government urgently needs to toughen its confusing and inadequate back-to-work safety guidance - starting with making masks a legal requirement on public transport and in shops.

'If we are to stop Covid-19 ripping through workplaces, workers must be able to afford to self-isolate. Government must urgently raise sick pay to the level of the real living wage and make sure everyone can get it.'

Business leaders have warned the 'pingdemic' was causing chaos for families, firms and hospitals and demanded changes on the NHS Covid-19 app to avoid a 'self-inflicted economic wound'.

NHS chiefs have also warned the system was making it 'increasingly difficult' to deliver routine care and said hospitals were now scrapping operations because so many workers were having to self isolate.

Nearly 900,000 alerts telling people to quarantine were issued in the first week of this month following contact with a coronavirus victim.

But rising numbers of people being forced into self-isolation has led unions to warn that factories across the country are on the 'verge of shutting' down.

It came as it was revealed a terrified 12-year-old girl hid behind her mother – afraid she was going to be arrested – when police turned up in numbers at her home to check that she was self-isolating.

Charlotte Crook had been at home following the rules after a positive coronavirus test and her shocked mother Kathryn yesterday branded the police response 'overkill'.

Officers came to her home in what the family said was a riot van, prompting a 'meltdown' from the bewildered schoolgirl.

Throughout the pandemic, police have faced accusations of heavy-handedness in enforcing Covid restrictions.

Up to 900 workers at car giant Nissan's flagship plant in Sunderland are being made to self-isolate after they were pinged by the app, it was claimed today.

And the National Care Association said care homes had 'real staffing issues' because of the app.

Bin rounds were also missed this week in Sutton Coldfield because of outbreaks of Covid and some hospital trusts have had up to 500 staff isolating at a time, forcing them to close beds and cancel operations.

Meanwhile the chief executive of Rolls-Royce, Torsten Muller-Otvos, said the car maker was on the 'edge of a critical situation' and a complete shutdown could not be ruled out.

He told The Daily Telegraph: 'Cases have gone through the roof and it is causing havoc.'

Elsewhere, Chris Hopson, of NHS Providers, said: 'Trust leaders continue to share serious concerns about rising levels of staff isolation, which are now significantly impacting on their ability to deliver care.'

This week, health secretary Sajid Javid warned daily Covid infections were likely to top 100,000 after restrictions are lifted on Monday. That could force around half a million a day to self-isolate.

Separate data from Test and Trace showed infections surged by 43 per cent last week after another 194,005 people tested positive for the virus. And Britain today recorded another 48,553 Covid cases in the biggest daily surge since January.

People told to isolate by the app are under no legal requirement to do so because their identity is not tracked by the software.

But fears have been raised that the software could cripple the nation's already fragile economy this summer when restrictions are completely lifted.

Businesses demanding a re-think of the rules have warned supermarket shelves may be left empty if tens of thousands of workers are told they must self-isolate in the coming weeks.

Unite assistant general secretary Steve Turner said: 'No one is advocating for Covid controls to go out the window and Unite's number one priority remain the health and safety of our members.

'But the reports Unite is receiving from our members and their employers are extremely worrying.

'It is not an exaggeration to say factories are on the verge of shutting and that at some sites hundreds of staff are off work.'

And councils have raised concerns over bin collections after Leeds, Bristol and Rochdale were forced to leave resident's rubbish on the curbside after the app forced workers to stay at home.

Liverpool Council yesterday confirmed bin collection would be cancelled for two weeks in parts of the city.

Cabinet member for neighbourhoods Abdul Qadir said: 'Unfortunately due to Covid guidelines on isolation our refuse service team is severely depleted, and we need to prioritise our waste collections.

'Our current programme is clearly not sustainable when one in four staff are unavailable to work.

'We know the temporary suspension of collecting garden waste will be an inconvenience but it will allow us to ensure general waste and alleyway cleansing is kept to schedule.

'Our recycling centres are also open late in the summer so residents have an option if they feel they can't wait for the next green bin cycle.

'After 19 July, the isolation guidelines change for those who have been double jabbed and this two week delay will give us time to re-organise the teams to ensure we can get back on track at the start of August.'

Now France could go on the RED list: Ministers consider expensive hotel quarantine for returners Ministers are considering whether to put France on the UK's red travel list in what would be a massive blow for UK holidaymakers. The move would force Brits returning from or transiting through the country into mandatory hotel quarantine on their return, even after July 19. Scientists are currently reviewing data from across the channel amid a surge in the South African or beta variant of the disease. France is currently on the UK amber list, meaning that from Monday, double-jabbed Brits would be allowed to holiday there without having to isolate on their return. But that would not apply to travel to red list countries, which currently include India, Pakistan, Brazil and Turkey. The Telegraph reported that the move was discussed at a meeting this week that saw the Balearic Islands moved from the green to amber list. Scientists have been ordered to take a 'deep dive' into data from France before such a serious decision can be taken. A decision could be taken as early as Monday. But Boris Johnson has previously refused to red list France due to the high level of cross-Channel goods traffic that could potentially be disrupted. Advertisement

UK PLC on brink of 'ping-demonium': Small firms to big business are on the verge of complete SHUTDOWN due to staff being forced into isolation after 'ping' from NHS Test and Trace app

** Has your business been hit by the 'pingdemic'? Email: tips@dailymail.com ** Advertisement

Factories are now on the verge of shutting and small businesses have already been forced to close because so many workers are having to self isolate across Britain in the 'pingdemic'.

Nearly 900,000 alerts telling people to quarantine were issued in the first week of this month alone after contact with a coronavirus victim.

It is causing chaos for families and firms, prompting business leaders to demand changes on the NHS Covid-19 app to avoid a 'self-inflicted economic wound'.

In retail and hospitality a third of staff are self-isolating in the worst-hit areas, forcing thousands of venues to shut.

People are pinged by the app and told to self-isolate for ten days after coming into contact with an infected person.

There is no legal requirement to self-isolate if pinged by the app - however, it is illegal to disobey an order to self-isolate in a phone call from NHS Test and Trace.

Plans to make the NHS Covid app less sensitive, meaning fewer people would be pinged, have been delayed as concerns mount over rising infection rates.

Here, businesses around Britain reveal the problems caused by the 'pingdemic':

Test and Trace system is 'woefully inadequate' with small businesses suffering 'crippling' effects, says HR consultant

Kate Underwood, who runs an HR and training consultancy firm in Southampton

An HR and training consultant blasted the Test and Trace system as 'woefully inadequate' saying that for many small businesses - especially in the hospitality, events and retail sectors - it is 'crippling'.

Kate Underwood, who runs the Kate Underwood HR and Training consultancy in Southampton, said some of her small business clients 'could have more than 75 per cent of their staff off at a time that when they need to be pulling out all the stops and starting to recover financially from this pandemic'.

She told MailOnline today: 'I have been asked advice on what to do from many clients and my advice is still the same - use common sense - talk to your teams and get them to make the decision on whether to trust the app. Put in extra Health and Safety measures yourself like doing a lateral flow test prior to any shift.

'From working in hospitality for 15 years, the passion from those that work in the industry is starting to get frazzled - they have been on furlough for months, now they get pinged to say they can't work and furlough payments have dropped.'

Charity boss says app pings are a 'real headache' and are costing it 'additional time and money that we can ill afford'

Marie Peacock, chief executive at Yorkshire's Brain Tumour Charity in Leeds

The boss of a brain tumour charity in West Yorkshire told MailOnline today how the 'pingdemic' was causing the organisation a 'real headache'.

Marie Peacock, chief executive at Yorkshire's Brain Tumour Charity in Leeds, said: 'Our fundraising income has been decimated and we are just starting to see some opportunities to begin to bring in the money we need to keep our support going, and guess what? The pings are going bonkers.'

She said the charity was attending the Great Yorkshire Show over four days this week, but lost half of their planned staff and volunteer cover due to self-isolation, even though they were testing daily and were showing no signs of symptoms.'

Ms Peacock added: 'I have had to move work and resources around, close our charity shop and try to cover the best way possible.

'It is costing the charity additional time and money that we can ill afford. I will always support and encourage my team to follow the advice, but have to admit the app has been deleted from my phone.'

Businesses across the country are 'only one ping away from a whole world of financial pain', says independent coffee firm owner

Craig Bunting, co-founder of BEAR in Derby

The co-founder of a coffee business told MailOnline that businesses across the country were 'only one ping away from a whole world of financial pain'.

Craig Bunting, co-founder of BEAR, a Derby-based independent coffee brand which has five stores in the UK, said not legalising the isolation requirements from the Test and Trace app 'shows that the Government doesn't trust its own technology and systems, so why should we, as small business owners?'

He added: 'We have stores that have closed, meaning lost revenue, and others on a permanent knife edge. You're only one ping away from a whole world of financial pain.

'Despite this, and as much as I might personally want to, we don't advise our staff to ignore the app, as we have a duty of care and responsibility as a brand to follow the guidance.

'We see evidence that more staff are making their own decision to remove the app or turn off contract tracing altogether. As a result, the Government are losing or have already lost the trust of the public.'

'I'm livid', says brewery owner who has six of his pubs shut due to staff shortages as he blasts Test and Trace as a 'joke'

William Lees-Jones, the owner of J.W. Lees

William Lees-Jones, the owner of J.W. Lees, a brewery and pub chain, currently has six of his 150 pubs shut because of staff shortages.

He said: 'I'm livid. It is frustrating at a time when we're trying to recover. It's one thing after another. Test and Trace has been a joke since it launched.'

The Manchester-based chain which was founded in 1828 has 42 managed pubs, inns and hotels - and also lets a further 105 venues to its pub partners.

At the start of July, Mr Lees-Jones said the number of his staff being asked to self-isolate by the NHS app had tripled in the previous few weeks from about 20 to more than 60. He said most were not ill or did not test positive for Covid-19.

Mr Lees-Jones has described Test and Trace as a 'nightmare' and is furious at how it appears hundreds of thousands of people are having to isolate despite not being ill.

Beauty salon owner says she 'lost income massively' when having to self-isolate and fears losing customers

Amy Baker, who owns a Wisbech beauty salon

The owner of a beauty salon said she has suffered from having to self-isolate when her children 'have the slightest cough'.

Amy Baker, who owns and runs Halo Beauty and Holistic Therapy in Wisbech, Cambridgeshire, said she and her husband have both had hospital appointments and surgical procedures over the past year - each time having to have a Covid test 72 hours prior to the procedure, along with all the household.

And she told MailOnline: 'If my children have the slightest cough, they too have had to take a Covid test and again (that) has meant that I have also had to isolate with them. Unfortunately because these are not informed by the app and because we get child tax credits via Universal Credit, we are not eligible to receive the £500 isolation payment.

'Being self-employed in the beauty industry in the 72 hours I have lost income massively due to this. If I started getting constant track and trace pings and have to cancel people's appointments, I fear I could lose customers.'

NHS app has been a 'disaster pretty much from the start', says mortgage advisory company's director

Imran Hussain, Harmony Financial Services

The director of a mortgage advisory company criticised the NHS app as a 'disaster pretty much from the start' and said trust from the public is 'paper thin'.

Imran Hussain, from Harmony Financial Services in Nottingham, told MailOnline: 'The Government not legislating that isolation is necessary if pinged does show a lack of faith from the Government in its own app, which has cost however many millions to create.

'We don't ever advise our team to ignore the app if pinged; as easy as it may be, I feel we have a responsibility to ensure we follow the guidance so we can all return to some normality as soon as possible. There's no doubt that trust from the public is paper thin currently.'

'We're on the edge of a critical situation': Rolls-Royce chief warns of possible shutdown with cases having 'gone through the roof'

Rolls-Royce boss Torsten Muller-Otvos

The chief executive of Rolls-Royce said the car maker was on the 'edge of a critical situation' after a large proportion of his UK staff were told to self-isolate.

Torsten Muller-Otvos said a complete shutdown of operations at its factories could not be ruled out, telling the Daily Telegraph: 'Cases have gone through the roof and it is causing havoc.'

He declined to say how many of its staff had been pinged by the NHS Covid-19 app, but told how the company is now looking at having to combine staff from both shifts into a single shift.

It comes after the firm said it had been 'religious' about social distancing in its factories during the pandemic.

The company has more than 22,000 employees across seven sites in the UK, in Bristol, Rotherham, Birmingham, Derby, Nottingham, Washington in Tyne and Wear and Inchinnan in Scotland.

'It's a real problem', says boss of shoe firm Timpson's which has more than 100 staff in self-isolation due to the NHS app

Timpson's founder Sir John Timpson

The Timpson's shoe repairs business has been badly affected by the 'pingdemic,' with more than 100 staff forced to isolate by the Test and Trace app.

Sir John Timpson, founder and owner of the chain, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme earlier this week: 'We are 140 people down... many due to isolation, which is people who have got to be home to look after children or people forced to isolate due to the Test and Trace app.'

The firm, which also runs three gastro pubs and restaurants in north Wales, also lost around £10,000-a-day when one - the Oyster Catcher, in Anglesey - was forced to close for similar reasons.

Sir John added: 'We have three busy pubs and, one of those on Anglesey, we had 24 people isolating. We had to shut the pub, costing us £10,000 a day in turn over, the pub was shut for 10 days, it's a real problem.'

His son, James, apologised for 'a dip in the level of service' in their shops. 'Like many schools and businesses, we are struggling because so many colleagues are isolating after being 'pinged' by Test and Trace,' he said. 'We also have 120 colleagues who have had to stay at home to care for children sent home from school.'

'Up to 900 staff' at Nissan plant in Sunderland are now self-isolating as car maker admits it is having to 'adjust' production

The Nissan car factory in Sunderland (file)

Car manufacturer Nissan is among the larger businesses hit by the 'pingdemic', with up to 900 staff at its plant in Sunderland said to be self-isolating.

The Japanese company, which employs 6,000 people at the major UK site, has had to make changes to how its factory is run due to the high number of employees being pinged by the app.

A Nissan spokesman said: 'Production in certain areas of the plant has been adjusted as we manage a number of staff being required to self-isolate following close contact with Covid-19.

'The wellbeing of our team is our number one priority and we remain confident in the rigorous safety controls we have on site.'

Britain WILL 'of course' face a new lockdown if Covid third wave hits 'unacceptable' levels of hospitalisation, minister warns as admissions continue above predicted levels and Chris Whitty admits UK may have to consider new restrictions within WEEKS

Britain will 'of course' face a new lockdown if Covid's third wave hits 'unacceptable' levels, a minister warned today after Chris Whitty admitted the country may have to face new restrictions within weeks.

Solicitor General Lucy Frazer suggested it was the right time to open up because of the vaccination drive — which has reached 90 per cent of Britons.

But with cases continuing to soar, hospital admissions tracking above some of SAGE's worst-case projections, and deaths having hit a four-month high, she warned that No10 may be left with no choice but to consider reimposing tough restrictions.

Ms Frazer said: 'Of course, if we get into a situation where it is unacceptable and we do need to put back further restrictions, then that of course is something the Government will look at.'

England's chief medical officer last night cautioned the UK could still 'get into trouble again surprisingly fast' and hospitals may face 'scary numbers' within a matter of weeks.

Making it clear the country was not on an irreversible path to freedom despite No10 pushing ahead with step four of the roadmap to normality on Monday, Professor Chris Whitty said: 'We are not by any means out of the woods yet.'

Boris Johnson has already dropped all mention of the final unlocking being 'irreversible'. The Prime Minister has resorted to caution, calling on people not to 'go wild' and immediately rush to take advantage of the final easing — which includes lifting work-at-home orders and reopening nightclubs.

Cases have spiralled over the past few weeks, with scientists blaming the easing of restrictions and young men gathering to watch England's Euro 2020 campaign for the uptick.

Vaccines have already saved thousands of lives since the third wave began, drastically slashing the proportion of infected patients who are left seriously ill. But jabs aren't perfect, and admissions have been tracking upwards for a fortnight.

Almost 560 infected patients are being admitted to NHS wards each day now, compared to fewer than 100 before the Indian Delta variant took off in mid-May. The current trend in figures is above some of the gloomiest estimates from SAGE, who warned hospitalisations could breach 4,000 a day in August.

It comes after health chiefs yesterday posted another 63 deaths, in the highest daily rise since March, and 48,553 cases.

Covid hospitalisations are above the levels estimated by SAGE for mid-July, at 559 on average. SAGE says there could be 2,000 a day in August when they think the second wave will peak

Covid hospital admissions (red dots) are tracking the estimates by the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. They had three models estimating how hospitalisations would rise if Britons took a long time to go back to pre-pandemic behaviours (blue line), a moderate amount of time (green line) or went back to normal just after 'Freedom Day' (red line)

Lucy Frazer warned Britain could be pushed into another lockdown if cases continue to rise. But she hinted that now was still the right time to lift restrictions. And Professor Chris Whitty (right) says restrictions could be reimposed in weeks

Public Health England data showed 10,267 more young men than women were infected over the last two weeks, with the gender gap having widened since the tournament kicked off

Saying restrictions should be eased on July 19, Ms Frazer told Sky News: 'I think the Health Secretary has been very clear, as has the Prime Minister, that we will see infections rise.

'But the reason why restrictions are being taken away is because of the vaccination programme, which will protect people when those infections do rise.

She added: 'We are going into the summer, a large number of people have been vaccinated, we've had a really tough time, we're still asking people to take responsibility and we do need to ask ourselves, if we don't open up now, when will we be able to open up?

'It is really important that we get the balance right between ensuring that we keep this virus under control and we take the necessary clinical measures to do that, but that we also recognise that there are consequences of not opening up and not allowing people to go about their daily lives.'

Professor Whitty warned yesterday that Britain is 'not out of the woods yet' and could face another lockdown within weeks.

Speaking at a Science Museum event, he said: 'I don't think we should underestimate the fact that we could get into trouble again surprisingly fast. We are not by any means out of the woods yet on this,.

'[But] we are in much better shape due to the vaccine programme, and drugs and a variety of other things.'

He called on Britons to 'take things incredibly slowly' after July 19, amid warnings from transport operators across the country that they will still ask people to wear face masks next week.

'If you look over what people have done, and in fact if you look at what people intend to do now, people have been incredibly good at saying, ''I may be a relatively low risk, but people around me are at high risk, and I'm going to modify my behaviours'',' he said.

Professor Whitty also warned the country was running the risk of seeing 'vaccine escape variants' that could push the UK 'some way backwards' into the worst days of the pandemic.

Some scientists have already blamed Euro 2020 for driving a ferocious surge in cases, after people crowded together in pubs and homes to watch the matches and tens of thousands of fans packed inside Wembley for England's six home games in London.

Experts have also speculated England's cases could start to fall after the national team's dramatic defeat to Italy on penalties in the final last Sunday. Scotland saw its outbreak start to fall when it crashed out of the competition early.

PHE's weekly surveillance report yesterday revealed cases are now at their highest levels since the pandemic began among teenagers, who are likely to have only had one dose of the vaccine. Rates were highest in the North East and Yorkshire, which have become the biggest hotspots for the Indian variant since the third wave took off.

Separate data from Test and Trace showed infections surged 43 per cent last week after another 194,005 people tested positive for the virus.

Despite the daily metrics pointing towards a growing epidemic, one surveillance study today suggested the third wave may have already peaked.

King's College London scientists behind the symptom study estimated 33,118 people were catching the virus daily in the week ending July 10, compared to 33,723 in the previous seven-day spell.

Professor Tim Spector, who leads the study, said infections may now be beginning to 'plateau' but the rate of decline was slower than during the second wave.

The study also found almost half of all cases are now among people who have received at least one dose of the Covid vaccine, which Professor Spector said may have happened because the virus was 'running out' of un-vaccinated people without previous immunity to infect.

This does not mean the jabs do not work. Scientists have always been honest that they are not perfect and millions will still be vulnerable to infection even after getting both doses.

It comes after a study yesterday suggested elderly Brits given AstraZeneca's vaccine are less likely to have Covid antibodies than those who had Pfizer's. Rigorous trials also showed the British-made jab was slightly weaker.

Two regions of England are recording their highest rate of new Covid-19 cases since comparable figures began in summer 2020, when mass testing was first introduced across the UK.

The North East recorded 835.8 cases per 100,000 people in the week to July 11, while Yorkshire and the Humber recorded 462.7 per 100,000, according to the latest Covid-19 surveillance report from PHE.

All other regions are recording their highest rate since January. Case rates are also rising for all age groups, with 20 to 29-year-olds recording the highest rate of 747.3 cases per 100,000 people.

It is the highest rate for this age group since the week to January 10. Both five to nine-year-olds (297.3 cases per 100,000) and 10 to 19-year-olds (729.1) are recording their highest rates since comparable figures began.

It comes amid reports France could be moved to the 'red list' in a massive blow for UK holidaymakers.

The move would force Brits returning from or transiting through the country into mandatory hotel quarantine on their return, even after July 19.

Scientists are currently reviewing data from across the channel amid a surge in the South African or beta variant of the disease.

France is currently on the UK amber list, meaning that from Monday, double-jabbed Brits would be allowed to holiday there without having to isolate on their return.

But that would not apply to travel to red list countries, which currently include India, Pakistan, Brazil and Turkey.

The Telegraph reported that the move was discussed at a meeting this week that saw the Balearic Islands moved from the green to amber list.

Scientists have been ordered to take a 'deep dive' into data from France before such a serious decision can be taken.

A decision could be taken as early as Monday. But Boris Johnson has previously refused to red list France due to the high level of cross-Channel goods traffic that could potentially be disrupted.

Yesterday air industry bosses today blasted the Government's 'on and off again' decision-making after Ibiza, Majorca and Menorca were axed from the green list, despite having lower Covid rates than the UK.

The move by Transport Secretary Grant Shapps to demote the Balearic Islands to the amber list of foreign destinations on Wednesday sparked fury from travel experts, MPs and holidaymakers.

Progressive New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez urged the U.S. government to 'stop granting refuge' to the authoritarian leader.

Meanwhile Texas Rep. Joaquin Castro told CNN that Bolsonaro 'should be sent back to Brazil.'

Both drew comparisons to January 6, 2021, when a crowd riled up by Donald Trump and his allies broke into the U.S. Capitol while lawmakers and then-Vice President Pence were inside certifying Trump's 2020 loss.

They too had been convinced that the 2020 presidential election was stolen. Just last month, a now-defunct House select committee recommended Trump be charged with insurrection among other crimes over the riot.

'Nearly 2 years to the day the US Capitol was attacked by fascists, we see fascist movements abroad attempt to do the same in Brazil,' Ocasio-Cortez wrote on Twitter Sunday.

American lawmakers heaped condemnation on the violent destruction in Brasilia on Sunday

Two in particular called for former President Jair Bolsonaro to be extradited back to Brazil

Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez demanded the U.S. 'cease granting refuge' to the authoritarian leader, who is currently in Florida

Bolsonaro lost to former President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva of the left-wing Workers Party. Ocasio-Cortez called on Americans to 'stand in solidarity' with Lula's 'democratically elected government.'

'The US must cease granting refuge to Bolsonaro in Florida,' she wrote.

Castro had accused Bolsonaro, who proudly embraced the nickname 'Trump of the Tropics,' of using the ex-president's 'playbook' in refusing to admit defeat and undermining confidence in an election that he lost.

'I stand with the democratically elected leadership in Brazil,' Castro told CNN. 'And he basically used the Trump playbook to inspire domestic terrorists to try and take over the government.'

Castro added that it 'looks a lot like January 6 in the United States.'

'Right now, Bolsonaro is in Florida, he's actually very close to Donald Trump - he should be extradited to Brazil. In fact, it was reported that he was under investigation for corruption and fled Brazil to the United States,' the Democrat went on.

'We were talking about asylum-seekers and immigration earlier - Republicans make a big deal and try to scare people about bad people in those groups coming to the United States. Well we know where one of them is, Jair Bolsonaro is in Florida hanging out with Donald Trump. He's a dangerous man.'

Asked if he was directly calling on the Biden administration to remove the former leader, Castro emphatically pressed: 'Yes, absolutely. Bolsonaro should not be in Florida, the United States should not be a refuge for this authoritarian who inspired domestic terrorism in Brazil.'

Former Montana state Democratic lawmaker Tom Winter posed: 'Why is our government giving safe haven to Jair Bolsonaro?'

Insurrectionists had left a sea of destruction at the Brazilian senate after storming the government buildings in a bid to overturn the election and force the military to hand back power to the defeated Bolsonaro.

The hallowed seats of power in Brasilia are bearing the scars of the unprecedented violence that broke out yesterday, with shards of glass, blood stains, furniture, government computers and files lying strewn across Congress, the presidential palace and the Supreme Court.

Investigators are trying to pick up the pieces and comb for evidence in the hours after thousands of right-wing rioters broke through police cordons to smash up the government buildings, destroying artwork, stealing the 1988 Constitution and seizing guns from a security office.

In the ugly scenes, police deployed tear gas, stun grenades and water cannons but were initially overwhelmed with the mayhem as protesters even beat a police officer to the ground off his horse and whacked both the cop and the animal with clubs.

Bolsonaro, who lost the divisive October elections to the veteran leftist Lula da Silva, has rejected his successor's claims he incited the 'fascist' attack and defended the right to 'peaceful protests'.

The invaders left a trail of destruction, throwing furniture through the smashed windows of the presidential palace, flooding parts of Congress with a sprinkler system and ransacking ceremonial rooms

A sea of enraged rioters wearing the Brazilian football shirt and military-style camouflage descended on the Three Powers Square, invading the floor of Congress, trashing the Supreme Court building and climbing the ramp to the Planalto, hoping for the military to restore Bolsonaro or oust Lula.

The protesters broke doors and windows to enter Congress, then streamed inside en masse, trashing lawmakers' offices and using the sloped speaker's dais on the Senate floor as a slide as they shouted insults at absent lawmakers.

Protesters damaged artworks, historic objects, furniture and decorations as they ran riot through the buildings and hurled computers and printers to the ground, much like their US counterparts almost two years to the day.

They punctured a massive Emiliano Di Cavalcanti painting in five places, overturned the U-shaped table at which Supreme Court justices convene, ripped a door off one justice's office and vandalized an iconic statue outside the court. The monumental buildings' interiors were left in states of ruin.

Shocking footage also shows a police car tearing through the crowds at high speeds, as throngs of protesters flee screaming in terror.

Other scenes from the day's chaos included a clip of a demonstrator apparently defecating on a desk inside a government chamber, and scores of protestors being led out of the National Congress building in handcuffs after being arrested by police.

Lula was only inaugurated a week ago and he has already been forced to declare emergency powers and deploy the national guard after 40 buses were seized to transport protesters to the seats of power in Brasilia.

Bolsonaro, who is believed to be in Florida, has repeatedly refused to accept his election defeat.

'These fascist fanatics have done something never before seen in this country's history,' said Lula, 77. 'We will find out who these vandals are, and they will be brought down with the full force of the law.'

Lula returned to Brasilia and viewed the damage at the presidential palace and the Supreme Court. He said he would work out of the palace on Monday despite all the destruction.

Justice Minister Flávio Dino said the acts amounted to terrorism and coup-mongering and that authorities have begun tracking those who paid for the buses.

Rishi Sunak said today on Twitter: 'I condemn any attempt to undermine the peaceful transfer of power and the democratic will of the people of Brazil.'

He said President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva has the UK's 'full support'.

'I look forward to building on our countries' close ties in the years ahead,' he added.

Foreign Secretary James Cleverly called the scenes 'unjustifiable'.

US President Joe Biden also criticised the incidents, tweeting: 'I condemn the assault on democracy and on the peaceful transfer of power in Brazil.'

Pope Francis also condemned a 'weakening of democracy' in the Americas today, citing the Brazil riots, in his yearly New Year's address to ambassadors.

'In many areas, a sign of the weakening of democracy is heightened political and social polarisation, which does not help to resolve the urgent problems of citizens,' said Francis during his speech at the Vatican.

The Argentine pontiff cited 'various countries of the Americas where political crises are laden with tensions and forms of violence that exacerbate social conflicts'.

'I am thinking of these last few hours in Brazil,' he said, in a line that was not included in the pre-released text.

TV images showed police ushering Bolsonaro supporters in single file down the ramp from the Planalto presidential palace - the same ramp Lula climbed a week earlier at his inauguration.

Police, who had established a security cordon around the square, fired tear gas in a bid to disperse the rioters - initially to no avail.

A journalists' union said at least five reporters were attacked, including an AFP photographer who was beaten by protesters and had his equipment stolen.

Hardline Bolsonaro supporters have been protesting outside army bases calling for a military intervention to stop Lula from taking power since his election win.

Lula's government vowed to find and arrest those who planned and financed the attacks.

Brasilia Governor Ibaneis Rocha fired the capital's public security chief, Anderson Torres, who previously served as Bolsonaro's justice minister.

The attorney general's office said it had asked the Supreme Court to issue arrest warrants for Torres 'and all other public officials responsible for acts and omissions' leading to the unrest.

It also asked the high court to authorize the use of 'all public security forces' to take back federal buildings and disperse anti-government protests nationwide.

Protester Sarah Lima told AFP they were demanding a review of the 'fraudulent election.'

Results from Brazil's election - the closest in over three decades - were quickly recognised by politicians across the spectrum, including some Bolsonaro allies, as well as dozens of governments.

Lula narrowly won the runoff by a score of 50.9 percent to 49.1 percent. Bolsonaro, who left for the US state of Florida on the second-to-last day of his term, has alleged he is the victim of a conspiracy against him by Brazil's courts and electoral authorities.

Brazilians have used electronic voting since 1996. Election security experts consider such systems less secure than hand-marked paper ballots because they leave no auditable paper trail.

Brazil's system is, however, closely scrutinized and domestic authorities and international observers have never found evidence of it being exploited to commit fraud.

Still, Bolsonaro's supporters refused to accept results in the past months. They have blocked roads and camped outside military buildings, urging the armed forces to intervene.

Protests were overwhelmingly peaceful, but isolated threats of terrorism - including a bomb found on a fuel truck headed to Brasilia's airport - had prompted security concerns.

Two days before Lula's Jan. 1 inauguration, Bolsonaro flew to the U.S. and took up temporary residence in Orlando.

Many Brazilians expressed relief that, while he declined to participate in the transition of power, his absence allowed it to occur without incident.

Or so it had been, until Sunday's havoc.

'Bolsonarism mimics the same strategies as Trumpism. Our Jan. 8 - an unprecedented manifestation in Brazilian politics - is clearly copied from Jan. 6 in the Capitol,' said Paulo Calmon, a political science professor at the University of Brasilia. 'Today's sad episodes represent yet another attempt to destabilize democracy and demonstrate that the authoritarian, populist radicalism of Brazil's extreme right remains active under the command of former President Bolsonaro, the `Trump of Latin America.''

U.S. President Joe Biden tweeted that the riots were an 'assault on democracy and on the peaceful transfer of power in Brazil,' and that he looked forward to continue working with Lula.

In a news conference from Sao Paulo state, Lula read a freshly signed decree for the federal government to assume control of security in the federal district.

He said that the so-called 'fascist fanatics,' as well as those who financed their activities, must be punished, and also accused Bolsonaro of encouraging their uprising.

Bolsonaro repudiated the president's accusation late Sunday. Writing on Twitter, he said peaceful protest is part of democracy, but vandalism and invasion of public buildings are 'exceptions to the rule.' He made no specific mention of the protesters' actions in Brasilia.

'He is evidently the intellectual mentor of what is happening, so he cannot dissociate from it,' said Mario Sérgio Lima, political analyst at Medley Advisors. 'These groups were created by him, by the radicalism he imposed on politics. There is no way to undo that. ... It seems his group has already crossed the Rubicon.'

Unlike the 2021 attack in the U.S., few officials would have been working in the top government buildings on a Sunday. And videos showed limited presence of the capital's military police.

That led many in Brazil to question whether the police had ignored abundant warnings, underestimated their abilities or had been somehow complicit.

'I'm here for history, for my daughters,' said Lima, 27, wearing the yellow jersey of the Brazilian national football team - a symbol Bolsonaro backers have claimed as their own - and protesting with her young twin daughters.

Fellow protester Rogerio Souza Marcos said the elections had been plagued by 'multiple signs of fraud and corruption.'

Newly installed Justice and Public Security Minister Flavio Dino called the invasion 'an absurd attempt to impose (the protesters') will by force.'

'It will not prevail,' he wrote on Twitter.

There was swift international condemnation of the protesters.

The United Nations said it 'vehemently condemns' the attacks.

US President Joe Biden slammed the scenes as 'outrageous,' European Council President Charles Michel tweeted his 'absolute condemnation,' and French President Emmanuel Macron called for respect for Brazil's institutions and sent Lula 'France's unwavering support.'

Even Italy's far-right Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni condemned the riots.

The book by two Washington Post reporters reveal a phone call between the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and Cheney where Mark Milley asked her how she was doing after the attack on the Capitol by Trump supporters.

'That f***ing guy Jim Jordan. That son of a b***h,' the excerpts from CNN claim she said, according to the book I Alone Can Fix It: Donald J. Trump's Catastrophic Final Year.

Cheney, who broke with her party to criticize Trump and was recently ousted as No. 3 ranking Republican, said during the call that she ran into Jordan on the House floor during the chaos that day.

'While these maniacs are going through the place, I'm standing in the aisle and he [Jordan] said, 'We need to get the ladies away from the aisle. Let me help you,'' the Wyoming at-large representative detailed to Milley.

'I smacked his hand,' she explained, 'and told him, 'Get away from me. You f***ing did this.''

Republican Rep. Liz Cheney (center) said, according to a new book, that she smacked fellow GOP Rep. Jim Jordan's hand away during the January 6 Capitol riot and told him to 'you f***ing did this' when he offered her help during the chaos in the House chamber

Jordan, speaking here on Jan. 6 to reject Electoral College votes in some swing states, has supported Trump's claims the 2020 election was illegitimate due to a slew of voter fraud

Jordan's office did not immediately respond to a DailyMail.com request for comment on the reported interaction with Cheney.

The Washington Post reporters Philip Rucker and Carol Leonnig's book will officially be released on July 20, but excerpts have started coming out from those who have obtained parts early.

The latest is a series of books coming out this summer about the former president's time in office – and in particular his final days in the White House, including the Capitol riot and his handling of the coronavirus pandemic.

Democrats blamed Trump for the Capitol attack on January 6, 2021 as his supporters stormed the comple to try and stop members from certifying the election win for Joe Biden.

The excerpts were taken from a new book due out next week titled I Alone Can Fix It: Donald J. Trump's Catastrophic Final Year

Shortly after, the House voted to impeach the then-president again, this time on grounds of 'inciting insurrection.' Cheney was the highest ranking Republican of the 14 who voted for Trump's second impeachment.

Months later, in May she was voted out as Republican Caucus chairwoman and was replaced with New York Representative Elise Stefanik, who while has a less conservative voting record, is more pro-Trump and did not vote to impeach him.

Cheney was recently the only Republican that Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi appointed to the select committee investigating the events of January 6 – further distinguishing herself from the current state of the GOP.

In contrast to Cheney, Jordan is one of the former president's most fervent supporters in Congress.

Following the 2020 election, the Ohio representative pushed Trump's claims that there was a slew of voter fraud and, therefore, the election results are illegitimate.","Cheney slapped Jim Jordan's hand, said 'you did this' when he tried to help during Capitol riot",1
https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2021/nov/21/paraguay-evictions-land-indigenous-agribusiness,1,"Armed police with water cannons and a low-flying helicopter have faced off against indigenous villagers brandishing sticks and bows in the latest clash over land rights in Paraguay, a country with one of the highest inequalities of land ownership in the world.

Videos of Thursday’s confrontation showed officers in riot armour jostling members of the Hugua Po’i community – including children and elderly people – out of their homes and into torrential rain.

Tractors then tore down the thatched wooden cabins and ripped up crops from the surrounding land, which is claimed by a Mennonite soybean farmer.

Later in the day, police armed with submachine guns briefly allowed a Guardian reporter and Mario Rivarola, a craftsman and community organizer, into the ruined village.

Stalks of maize lay in the churned-up mud. Clothes, flip-flops, half-finished meals and broken bed-frames were strewn about. A pair of scrawny kittens wandered among the flaming wreckage.

“This is another blow against indigenous peoples,” lamented Rivarola, whose relatives had lived in the village. The surrounding land is valuable, with fertile soil, a river and a paved road on hand. But it also has a spiritual and environmental importance, he said.

“The graves of our grandparents are here,” Rivarola explained, adding that the community had returned 10 years ago to occupy their ancestral land. “We want to recover its history and preserve the forest that remains.”

At the Cop26 conference in Glasgow earlier this month, western leaders agreed to give indigenous peoples at least $1.7bn to support their crucial role in protecting the world’s carbon-dense forests.

Of the record 227 environmental and land defenders killed worldwide in 2020, a third were indigenous, with Colombia, Mexico and Brazil topping the list of the deadliest countries.

Also in Glasgow, over 100 countries – including Paraguay, after some hesitation – promised to end deforestation by 2030.

But a wave of rural evictions in Paraguay this year demonstrates the challenge in converting these agreements into concrete action to halt agribusiness from advancing into Latin America’s surviving forests – and dislodging their inhabitants.

Paraguay’s forests – especially in the parched Chaco region to the west – are vanishing faster than perhaps anywhere else on Earth, say researchers. Severe flooding, historic droughts and uncontrolled bushfires have made headlines in recent years.

Between May and June this year, as the Covid-19 pandemic raged, at least seven native communities across the country were forcibly removed from their homes.

In September, Mario Abdo Benítez, Paraguay’s conservative president, approved a law doubling jail sentences – to up to 10 years – for those found guilty of illegally occupying private land.

And this November alone, five indigenous and small farmer settlements were destroyed by police, leaving hundreds homeless.

More than a hundred human rights campaigners gathered in Asunción, Paraguay’s capital, branded such evictions an “express violation” of Paraguay’s constitution and international treaties.

“There’s a direct relationship between these evictions and climate change,” said Guillermo Achucarro, a climate policy researcher with Base-Is, a thinktank.

Agriculture is Paraguay’s largest single contribution to global heating – accounting for about half of the country’s emissions of gases like carbon and methane – followed by deforestation.

“The people who deforest and emit greenhouse gases are the big landowners,” Achucarro added. “Most of them are soybean planters and cattle ranchers. They’re the same people that control the police and use them to kick out indigenous and campesino communities.”

In Paraguay, land is concentrated in fewer hands than anywhere else in the world, according to the World Bank. Just 2% of people own over 80% of farmland.

Paraguay’s delegation to Cop26 included several agribusiness representatives but no indigenous people. Along with Venezuela and Bolivia, Paraguay was initially among the only Latin American countries not to sign the historic agreement to end deforestation within a decade. It then backtracked amid a public outcry.

“It was shameful,” said Achucarro.

Indu, the state institution responsible for safeguarding Paraguay’s 19 native peoples, did not respond to requests for comment.

Asked how he felt among the destructive aftermath of the eviction at Hugua Po’i, Rivarola was silent for a while.

“Powerless,” he finally said. “But sooner or later we will win this land back, the territory of our ancestors. We’re not going to give up the fight because of this.”",Indigenous community evicted as land clashes over agribusiness rock Paraguay,1

The cryptocurrency championed by Elon Musk has outpaced Bitcoin to rise from $0.15 to $0.42 in a matter of days - a jump of 180 per cent.

It comes as Elon Musk was nominated to head Donald Trump's new Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) when he comes to office in January.

Musk, alongside entrepreneur and former Republican candidate Vivek Ramaswamy, will aim to cut federal spending by as much as a third after a 'complete financial and performance audit of the entire federal government, and making recommendations for drastic reforms', according to Trump.

'Dogecoin', Musk's preferred crypto token, originally refers to a viral image of a Shiba Inu dog, popular online from 2010.

Elon Musk speaks during a PAC Town Hall in Folsom, Pennsylvania, on October 17, 2024

A visual representation of the digital Cryptocurrency, Dogecoin (DOGE) is on display on November 12, 2024 in Paris, France

Dogecoin has climbed significantly since the election, and at a faster rate than Bitcoin

Dogecoin, launched three years later, has been promoted as a 'fun and friendly internet currency' and acknowledges its origins as a 'joke'.

The crypto was intended to make fun of other cryptos as Bitcoin came to the fore, but grew in popularity - and even went on to sponsor a soccer team in the UK.

It is not clear why Musk took interest in the currency, but he has continued to make reference to the meme in posts on X, which he bought in October 2022.

Dogecoin's popularity surged ahead of Musk's SNL performance in 2021, which one analyst linked to the billionaire Tesla CEO.

'Dogecoin is like this kind of big F-U to the system,' Avi Felman, Head of Trading at BlockTower Capital, told CNBC at the time.

'It's like, ""Yeah, this thing can have value, too. And I'm just going to buy it, because I'm going to buy it.""'

'Elon is basically pushing up this message of, ""Why can’t dogecoin have value?""' said Felman.

'It’s part of the GameStop boom. People like these narratives... they like these jokes.'

Ahead of the US election, some investors again predicted that a Trump win would help Dogecoin in light of Musk's support of the Republican candidate.

Since the election, Musk has reportedly been holed up at Mar-a-Lago as Trump considers his staffing choices.

Trump had already floated the idea of a new department to oversee federal spending under the watch of Musk.

As well as launching SpaceX, Tesla and other companies including the original X.com, later merging with Confinity to become PayPal.

After taking over Twitter in 2022, Musk cut staff by as much as 80 per cent in a push to reform the company in his vision.

Musk defended the layoffs saying he had no choice when the company was losing $4mn a day, having paid $44bn.

He said the cuts were needed to rein in expenditure and keep the company functional and efficient.

But insiders said they worried the cuts had affected their ability to do their jobs. Twitter suffered four outages in February 2023 alone - compared to nine in all of 2022.

Staff also said that due to cuts and changes to features, they could no longer protect users from trolling and child sexual exploitation, nor the rife disinformation Musk set out to combat.

'Nobody's taking care' of the work around safety measures now, an engineer told the BBC in March last year.

Musk contested some of these claims in the rare media interview with in April, saying there was less misinformation on the site since the takeover, helped by efforts to delete automated accounts.

Musk's own artificial intelligence model Grok assessed this month that 'based on various analyses, social media sentiment, and reports, has been identified as one of the most significant spreaders of misinformation on X since he acquired the platform'.

Fidelity estimated earlier this year that X is now worth 80 per cent less than when Musk bought it.

As Dogecoin climbed to a three-year high, Bitcoin rallied to the verge of $90,000 on Tuesday, also riding the wave of euphoria since the election of Trump as U.S. president on expectations his administration will be crypto friendly.

The world's biggest cryptocurrency has become one of the most eye-catching movers in the week since the election and touched $89,982 - a gain of around 30% since November 5. It was last down 1.4% at $86,730.

Bitcoin is surging along with Musk's automaker Tesla , which is up nearly 40% since voting results rolled in, as investors figure Trump's friends and interests will do well while he is in office.

'The crypto enthusiasts think they have a like-minded incoming president,' said Alvin Tan, head of Asia FX strategy at RBC Capital Markets.

'The thing about bitcoin at the end of the day is that there is no valuation anchor to it, it's hard to get a grip on fair value. So when sentiment is very positive, it does get carried away a lot more than other asset classes.'

Trump embraced digital assets during his campaign, promising to make the United States the 'crypto capital of the planet' and to accumulate a national stockpile of bitcoin.

It is not clear how or when that could happen but the possibility drove a speculative surge in crypto mining and trading stocks.

'I think it increases the chances that other nation states buy bitcoin in a bid to front run the U.S.,' said Matthew Dibb, chief investment officer at cryptocurrency asset manager Astronaut Capital.

'Additionally I think it would be a crazy catalyst for the U.S. listed bitcoin miners ... given possibilities of such entities getting nationalized.'

Crypto miner Riot Platforms jumped nearly 17% on Wall Street on Monday. Fellow miners MARA Holdings and CleanSpark leapt nearly 30%.

Software company and investor in bitcoin MicroStrategy announced it had spent about $2 billion buying bitcoin between October 31 and Nov. 10. Shares rose 26% on Monday.

'Obviously (it's) a clear Trump trade as he is so supportive of the industry, and this can only mean more demand both for crypto stocks as well as the currencies themselves,' Nick Twidale, chief market analyst at ATFX Global in Sydney, said of the bitcoin rally.

'The fact that bitcoin was trading near all-time highs when the election result came through meant that it had clean sky above.'

The euphoria extended across the crypto landscape with smaller tokens such as ether and dogecoin surging, although they dipped on Tuesday morning in Europe.

Crypto investors see an end to increased scrutiny under U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Gary Gensler whom Trump has said he will replace. Trump also unveiled a new crypto business, World Liberty Financial, in September.

'What we're seeing isn't just a price milestone; it's a signal that the market is warming to the idea of bitcoin as a more stable, even politically favoured, asset,' said Justin D'Anethan, head of Asia-Pacific business development at digital assets market maker Keyrock.",Elon Musk backed Dogecoin surges after Donald Trump handed him new government efficiency department also called DOGE,1

The Duke and Duchess of Sussex will head to Colombia on an undisclosed date later this year despite both the UK and US governments issuing travel alerts for the crime-ridden country amid fears over the risk of terrorism, civil unrest and kidnapping.

And the Sussexes' decision to accept an invitation to visit from the country's vice president Francia Márquez comes amid Harry's ongoing security battle in the UK.

One British former royal protection officer, who served Harry's family for several years, told MailOnline: 'They have chosen to visit one, if not the most, dangerous countries in the world. But nothing amazes me [with Harry and Meghan] these days.'

The UK's Foreign and Commonwealth Office 'advises against all but essential travel to parts of Colombia'. And the US Department of State issued a travel advisory for Colombia stating: 'Reconsider travel due to crime and terrorism. Exercise increased caution due to civil unrest and kidnapping. Some areas have increased risk.'

MailOnline understands the Duke and Duchess will be provided full security detail for the entirety of their visit alongside Ms Márquez.

It comes after they took a four-person security team to Nigeria for their tour in May amid concerns over the risk of violence, terrorism and kidnapping in the country.

In Colombia, the Sussexes will 'engage with leaders, youth and women' and join activities related to 'cyberbullying, online exploitation and the mental health impacts of these threats'.

Ms Márquez's office said the couple would 'experience the rich heritage of Colombia' and help 'illuminate Colombia's role as a beacon of culture and innovation'.

She added that the visit would precede the first Global Ministerial Conference on Ending Violence Against Children, which will be in Colombia this November.

It comes after Harry - who now lives in Montecito, California - lost his High Court challenge in London in February against the UK Government over his right to state-funded police protection when visiting Britain.

He had told a judge that he did not feel able to bring his children Archie, five, and Lilibet, three, to the UK and could not put Meghan 'in danger like that'.

Harry was then given permission in May to go to the Court of Appeal over the decision made in 2020 by the Executive Committee for the Protection of Royalty and Public Figures (Ravec), which is part of the Home Office.

Confirming their visit today, Ms Márquez said: 'As the vice president of Colombia and minister of equality and equity, I am pleased to announce that Prince Harry and Meghan, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, have kindly accepted my invitation to visit our beautiful country.

'During their trip, the Duke and Duchess will join me in visiting Bogotá, as well as the Caribbean and Pacific regions of Cartagena and Cali.

'In these vibrant locations, they will have the exceptional opportunity to engage with leaders, youth, and women who embody the aspirations and voices of Colombians committed to progress.

'In addition to these meaningful interactions, the Duke and Duchess will experience the rich heritage of Colombia.'

She added that the visit would come at a 'particularly significant time' given that it precedes the Ending Violence Against Children conference.

Continuing, Ms Márquez said: 'The Archewell Foundation, founded by the Duke and Duchess, is renowned for its global leadership in fostering a safer online environment.

'The forthcoming conference will unveil a comprehensive framework for creating safer physical and digital spaces, tackling issues such as cyberbullying, online exploitation, and the mental health impacts of these threats.

'It will offer actionable solutions and commitments for countries around the world. During their visit, The Duke and Duchess, as well as The Archewell Foundation, will engage in several activities related to this important topic.

'We are confident that their visit will further illuminate Colombia's role as a beacon of culture and innovation.'

Around the same time as the Colombia announcement, CBS released a clip of an upcoming interview with Harry and Meghan, with the Duke saying parents have to be 'first responders'.

The Prince went onto say that 'terrifyingly' many parents do not know to 'tell the signs of possible suicide'.

The full interview with appear on the US channel's Sunday Morning show - three years on from their bombshell interview with Oprah Winfrey on the same network.

Meghan said: 'Our kids are young, they're three and five, they're amazing, but all you want to do as parents is protect them. And so as we can see what's happening in the online space, we know that there's a lot of work to be done there and we're just happy to be able to be a part of change for good.'

Also today, CBS released a clip of Harry and Meghan in an interview about children and the online world, which will be broadcast on the US channel's Sunday Morning show

Presenter Jane Pauley said: 'Well you hope that when your children ask for help, someone is there to give it.' Harry then added: 'If you know how to help'. And Pauley said: 'Thank you.'

Harry continued: 'At this point we've got to the stage where almost every parent needs to be a first responder. And even the best first responders in the world wouldn't be able to tell the signs of possible suicide. That is the terrifying piece of this.'

In May, Harry and Meghan went on a three-day visit to Nigeria on the invitation of the country's chief of defence staff.

The couple visited a school, met injured service members at a military hospital and attended training sessions for charity organisation which work with the Invictus Games.

They also went to a reception where military families were honoured, and Meghan to co-hosted an event of Women in Leadership with Dr Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, the director-general of the World Trade Organisation.

The couple's other engagements included a basketball camp with Giants of Africa, a cultural reception and a polo fundraiser for Nigeria: Unconquered.

It comes after friends of Harry claimed King Charles III is no longer answering his estranged son's calls or responding to his letters as their rift deepens.

The Duke and Charles last saw each other in person in February when they met for 45 minutes in London following the monarch's cancer diagnosis.

But sources close to Harry said their communication has worsened since amid growing tensions over the Duke's battle for his security when in Britain.

The Duke of Sussex is said to be 'frightened' about the safety of his wife Meghan Markle and children Prince Archie and Princess Lilibet - and believes the King has the power to intervene in his ongoing court case with the Home Office .

Sources told US magazine People that the issue of security began as a point of frustration between father and son but has now developed into 'complete silence'.

A friend of Harry's said: 'He gets 'unavailable right now'. His calls go unanswered. He has tried to reach out about the King's health, but those calls go unanswered too.'

Harry last visited the UK in May to celebrate the 10th anniversary of the Invictus Games, but could not meet his father during this recent trip.

The Duke's spokesman said at the time that this was due to the King's 'full programme'.

The magazine also quoted sources claiming Meghan wishes Harry 'could let go of these lawsuits' over their security because she wants the Duke to be 'free' and 'live in the moment'.

The People report quoted a former employee of the Archewell Foundation, who said: '[Meghan] wants him to be free of all of this, but she also knows that because of everything he's been through and his love for [her and their children], he can't. She wants him to live in a world where he is not burdened by this.'","Harry and Meghan choose to visit one of the world's most dangerous countries, again': Ex-royal protection officer weighs in as security-conscious Sussexes reveal tour to Colombia despite UK safety fears",1

'He's made a big mistake, a very big mistake.

'But I believe he wasn't in his right mind.'

Their son was later charged with terrorism and faces a possible life sentence.

Following a series of raids in the aftermath of the alleged attack, police have brought charges against six more boys, some as young as 14, who are accused of being part of a terrorist network.

At primary school he was bullied and would lash out, his parents said.

'In school, I used to get scared whenever I'd get a phone call, because I knew that they complained about him,' his mother said.

ABC Investigations discovered that the boy was interacting with extremists in Australia and across the world in the months leading up to the stabbing.

His profile picture on WhatsApp was a photo of Osama Bin Laden, the man responsible for 9/11.

After police seized his phone they discovered he was part of a WhatsApp group called BROTHERHOOD with other teenagers who expressed sympathies with violent extremism.

The boy had liked a series of violent posts, including a video of Bin Laden encouraging Muslims to die for their cause.

He made a final post on Instagram around an hour before the alleged stabbing, imploring Muslims to 'attain victory over their enemies'.

Bishop Emmanuel, an Orthodox Assyrian with a large online following, has made several controversial comments about Islam, including that 'Prophet Muhammad failed because he is dead'.

Peta Lowe, a juvenile extremism expert and former director of Countering Violent Extremism for NSW Juvenile Justice, told the ABC that it was 'very common for individuals to have what they call ""leakage"", just as they approach actually conducting an attack'.

'It was a very clear message that he had got to the point where he was motivated to act on his beliefs,' Ms Lowe said.

The boy underwent surgery after accidentally cutting off one of his own finger during the incident.

But his mother revealed his odd response when they visited him in hospital after the alleged attack.

'He was asking for a hug and kiss because he saw I was upset,' his mother said.

'Sometimes he'd laugh, sometimes he'd say ""I don't know"".

'He was showing me his hand like a baby. I think he didn't know what he was doing.'

His parents also claimed he had been upset after the death of a friend two days before the stabbing.

Ansen Wong, a 20-year-old student activist, was among hundreds of thousands of Hong Kong citizens who rallied in the streets for demonstrations beginning in March 2019.

Wall Street Journal reports that the California-born activist was convicted of criminal damage, similar to vandalism, for his role in the wide scale protests.

Ansen Wong, a 20-year-old student activist and American citizen, said he was denied refuge at the U.S. consulate while seeking protection from prosecution

His most recent charge of unlawful assembly came after he joined others in a massive pro-democracy protest outside of Hong Kong's legislature last year.

'I am running out of options,' Wong told WSJ.

Wong was reportedly in the midst of contesting the charges, but accidentally missed a mandatory court date on the same day he visited the U.S. consulate.

People are typically given light sentences over unlawful assembly, but the crime can result in up to five years in prison.

Wong told WSJ that he approached the consulate on October 27 with three others who also sought refuge there.

An official reportedly told Wong refuge couldn't be offered and directed him to find a lawyer. He added that diplomats would keep an eye on his case.

Tony Chung (pictured), a 19-year-old fellow activist, was supposed to accompany the group to the consulate but was arrested earlier that day at a coffee shop.

Tony Chung, a 19-year-old fellow activist, was supposed to accompany the group to the consulate but was arrested earlier that day at a coffee shop.

Chung was an organizer for Studentlocalism, a pro-democracy organization. He was arrested by Hong Kong's national security unit over social media posts he made in September.

Wong's attempt to secure protections highlights the plight facing many of Hong Kong's protesters, who fear facing criminal charges for their opposition to China's Communist Party.

A group of demonstrators attempting to escape to Taiwan via speedboat were caught and arrested by Chinese authorities in August. They were jailed shortly after.

The demonstrations began last year after officials introduced the Fugitive Offender amendment bill, which would have allowed Hong Kong to detain and extradite fugitives to places like Taiwan.

Critics feared that the legislation would allow people to be detained in Mainland China, where laws are governed by the Communist Party.

What followed was the streets of Hong Kong being flooded by activists and clashes with police officers that further galvanized the demonstrators.

The United States has offered support to the pro-democracy protesters and vowed to give priority to asylum seekers in Hong Kong.

But WSJ reports that Wong's situation underscored the limitations of the U.S.'s support as officials try to navigate diplomacy with China.

Jude Blanchette, a China specialist at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, told WSJ that giving refuge to an individual inside the consulate could upset Chinese officials - leaving room for an international incident.

While U.S. embassies and consulates do offer protection for those who fear impending harm, they typically don't offer the same shelter for people hoping to avoid prosecution 'except in the narrowest of circumstances.'

Wong, a university student and bar tender, said his life changed when he became involved in activism.

'I grew up here, and I love this place,' Wong told WSJ about Hong Kong. 'When I saw its liberty being hindered every day, I knew I had to do something.

He added that Hong Kong authorities currently have possession of his original U.S. passport. He currently has a copy on hand.

Wong explained that he visited the U.S. consulate from Friends of Hong Kong, a London-based group that introduced him to other asylum seekers with hopes they could obtain protection together.

Friends of Hong Kong reportedly sent an information package to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo in October regarding the asylum seekers.

The girl, named only as Maria, was part of a group of 39 migrants - 22 men, nine women and eight children - who say they were left stranded in no-man's land for more than a month after both Greece and Turkey refused to take them in.

Baida, a 27-year-old woman travelling with the group, said they arrived on an unnamed island in the Evros river on July 14 but were left without food, water, or access to medicine as the two countries argued over who was responsible.

The group was eventually rescued on Monday by Greek authorities who finally acknowledged they were responsible for their safety.

Baida, a 27-year-old Syrian woman, says she and a group of 39 refugees were stuck on the border between Turkey and Greece for a month while the two argued over taking them

Greece's migration ministry said the group were in 'very good condition' but that a heavily pregnant woman had been taken to hospital as a precaution.

However, Baida has told a different story - claiming that two young men drowned trying to get off the island before Maria was stung by a scorpion and died from the venom last week, Channel 4 News reported.

She claimed Maria's sister, nine-year-old Aiya, was also stung and left in a critical condition.

Baida said: 'What's going to happen? Maybe we all die in the morning. This island is full of snake, scorpions and lots of insects.

'Please help. I swear it's hell on earth and no-one can help us.'

Greek authorities have not confirmed this account, and did not mention a child taken to intensive care following the rescue.

However, Migration Minister Notis Mitarachi has said that authorities will return to the island today to search for the dead girl's body.

Baida said the group had landed on the island on July 14, and that Greek authorities had been made aware of their location several days later.

Among the group were 22 men, nine women and eight children - with one of the children, five, said to have died of a scorpion sting while on the island

The group say they were left to fend for themselves on a 'hell-hole island' covered in snakes and scorpions, and without any access to food or clean water

Despite being on the Greek side of the river, Baida claims authorities arrived and pushed them back into Turkey on July 26.

She further claims the Turks took her and her companions around 16 miles north and dumped them on a second island on August 1.

A week later, following an armed standoff between Turkey and Greece, she claims the Turks took the group back to the original island on August 7.

Baida says the island has little food or clean water, and was crawling with insects, snakes and scorpions.

She desperately appealed to Greek authorities via aid groups to come to her rescue.

Charity workers say they were prevented by Greece from going to aid Baida and the rest of her group.

Greece now says confusion over the location of the group stopped officials from saving the migrants sooner.

It says that, after they were found earlier this week, rescue workers were able to go and bring the migrants to safety.

Greece and Turkey - who have fought multiple wars against each-other - have been locked in a tense standoff over migrants for years.

Turkey has taken in millions of refugees from conflicts that have devastated neighbouring nations Iraq and Syria.

Baida claims two men drowned trying to swim off the island to safety, and another girl - nine-year-old Aiya - was also stung by a scorpion and was critically ill

Greece eventually rescued the migrants on Monday, a month after they first arrived on the island, after accepting responsibility for them

The EU pays Turkey billions of euros to keep the migrants there, fearing a repeat of the 2016 migrant crisis if they are allowed to freely cross into Greece - an EU state.

But thousands still attempt the crossing every year. In 2021, more than 9,000 came - roughly half by sea who generally land on small islands near the Turkish coast, and the other half by land via the Evros river.

So far in 2022, some 7,500 have tried to cross - split roughly in half between water and land routes, according to UN data.

Around 100 people have died each year attempting the crossing since the EU began cracking down on arrivals in 2017, the UN says.

The crisis has occasionally prompted clashes between Greece and Turkey.

In 2020, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan threw open his side of the border to migrants following the death of dozens of Turkish troops in Syria.

Erdogan accused EU leaders of failing to show support for his intervention in Syria, where Turkish-backed rebels were fighting Russian-backed government troops.

Even now I feel traumatised, exhausted, incredulous. Four days ago, on an afternoon of glorious sunshine when I'd allowed myself to hope that the bleakest days of the pandemic were past, I was pitched into an ordeal that has left me reeling.

A girlfriend and I were standing with her 13-year-old son in a queue at an artisan bakery waiting for a coffee. We were doing nothing more.

Chatting at a social distance, masks ready, we stood outside revelling in the unaccustomed warmth of the sun, waiting to buy our drinks and cake.

Five minutes later, four police officers had surrounded me. In a flash, a thickset policeman had my arm in a vicious, vice-like grip, twisted behind my back.

The pain was sharp. It made me wince. 'Why are you hurting me?' I cried out. 'What the hell are you doing?'

Meanwhile, a female officer was handcuffing me. I started to panic. 'I don't believe this,' I sobbed. 'It's insane.'

I tried to calm myself, to slow the pace of my thudding heart. One of my wrists was cuffed, my other arm was wrenched back and the male officer was trying to grab my phone.

How had it come to this? How had a pleasant afternoon's walk — which combined physical exercise and much needed mental relief from the pandemic — to a coffee shop in Borough Market two miles away from our homes in South-West London descended into such chaos and terror?

The mother-of-two claims that four police officers approached her before putting her in handcuffs (above)

As I think back over the events of last Saturday afternoon I still find it hard to believe how swiftly and arbitrarily the mood changed; how outrageously heavy-handed the reaction of the police was.

I consider myself a law-abiding citizen. A married mother of two teenage sons, I work as a psychotherapist.

Indeed, I had two flourishing practices specialising in helping those with mental health problems until the pandemic decimated my business. I am now upwards of £70,000 in debt. But I'll come to that later.

For our family — as for countless others — the pandemic has been a trial of our resilience and fortitude. It has not been easy, financially or emotionally. Yet we've stuck to the rules.

When my brother-in-law died of cancer, aged 60, last December we were unable to visit him as he breathed his last in hospital. We accepted it as a necessary corollary of the pandemic. We had to keep everyone safe.

I know I am not alone in struggling to remain hopeful. My close friend and her teenage son were also lowered by successive lockdowns, from observing the constraints imposed by the pandemic.

Which was why, when we woke to a day full of sunshine last weekend, we felt that hope was just around the corner. We proposed a modest outing — there is no other kind to be had, after all, these days — to cheer ourselves up.

Ms Knight, who works as psychotherapist, said that she eventually gave officers her name and address and is expecting a £200 fine to arrive any day now

And as we walked along, chatting pleasantly — ensuring we kept the requisite two metres apart — we looked forward to the refreshments we proposed to buy at a bakery that had the foresight to arrange takeaways.

It was while we were queuing outside the shop that the mood started to turn sour.

Four police officers — three women and a man — were outside the bakery. The male officer held a loudhailer, as if he was preparing to marshal restive crowds at a riot. Was it really necessary to police people waiting patiently in a queue with such a heavy hand?

There were about six people ahead of us, standing sensibly at appropriate distances, and the officers were processing down the line asking where they'd come from.

Then they got to us. To the same question, we answered that we'd walked just over two miles from our homes in South-West London. The male officer didn't question the number in our party, but to our surprise, said, 'Then you need to leave. You've come too far. You've breached the Covid rules. We're issuing you with a £200 fine.'

At this stage, I was bewildered. What exactly are the rules? Apart from the instruction 'Stay Local', no one seems to know. Boris Johnson rode seven miles on his bicycle to take exercise some months back and to my certain knowledge he was not reprimanded or arrested.

I did not ask what an appropriate distance to travel would be. I merely retorted calmly that we'd just come to buy our coffees and then go home. But this was when things turned ugly.

The four officers converged on me, getting so close they were certainly infringing the two-metre social-distancing rule. I suppose I could have meekly gone home, but I felt outraged. I was being asked for my address and ID just for queuing for a coffee. I confess I started to sound irritated. 'Is it a crime to stand outside a shop and buy a coffee?' I demanded. It seemed that it was. The whole thing was preposterous.

This was when the two officers descended; one arm was twisted behind my back, the other cuffed. 'Why are you hurting me? That's totally unnecessary,' I wailed. 'We learnt to do that at police training college,' the burly male officer replied.

He tried to wrest my phone from me but I managed to wrench it back and hide it in my handbag. My friend was filming on her mobile. Another passer-by stopped to ask if I was OK. What on earth was happening?

Knowing how insanely the police were overreacting, I felt enraged. The huge pressures I'd endured during the pandemic started to crowd in on me: my lost business, my brother-in-law's death; the months of bleak isolation at home. And now this one spark of joy — a little weekend outing — was ending in aggression and tears.

But then a small voice inside my head told me how stupid I'd be to find myself with a criminal record just because I was over-wrought and angry at the huge overreaction of the police. So I calmed myself.

I reasoned, too, that I am not a troublemaker. I also have a strong sense of justice; of what is morally right and wrong. Perhaps if I'd lied to the police that I lived just around the corner I would not have ended up incurring their wrath.

But I do not lie. That's the whole point. With a heavy heart, I gave them my name and address, knowing notice of a £200 fine will arrive any day now. This is money I can ill afford to part with as I am my family's main breadwinner and my business debts — including rent and business rates — are mounting.

I'm far from the only one dreading the consequences of an innocent trip out of the house. Reports of needlessly heavy-handed police tactics are numerous. I've heard of one father of two who was questioned by police after taking his children and dog out for a walk around a reservoir, four miles from their village in Yorkshire.

When he and his wife returned to their car, a policewoman appeared and asked them what they were doing. She said she had done a registration check and knew the car was from outside the area.

When the couple replied that it was their area, the officer said they shouldn't be leaving their village. They challenged her on this, asking where does it say you can't leave your village to take exercise?

The officer handed them a leaflet entitled Coronavirus Regulations: Restrictions On Movement, which advised them that the circumstances of their vehicle being present at that location was not a 'reasonable interpretation of the exemption to restrictions on movement'.

He is still waiting to hear if he will be fined.

Yesterday, another man was allegedly strip-searched in custody after police arrested him for a suspected breach of Covid rules. He'd travelled to a beach 20 miles from his home in North Wales to walk by the sea and give his wife and teenage son a 'mental break' from the stresses of lockdown.

There are, of course, grievous breaches that must be controlled and I applaud the police for their part in this.

In general, I have huge respect for the police who, by and large, do a difficult job in challenging circumstances. I know, too, the pressures exerted by the pandemic have made their task even more difficult.

But why do they seem so readily to be picking on law-abiding citizens doing their best to follow confusing restriction rules while serious crimes go unpunished? What, for instance, are they doing about knife crime? Our capital city has its own epidemic of deaths from stabbings.

One of my sons — indeed just about every pupil in his class — has been the victim of a terrifying attack. He was stopped at knifepoint and surrounded by a group of thugs who told him they were going to 'shank' (stab or slash) him if he didn't hand over his phone. He did so, they booked an Uber on it and fled.

I turned detective and was able to trace the route they took as the Uber was charged to my account. I provided the police with the information. The criminals were apprehended and found to have stacks of stolen credit cards on them, as well as my son's phone.

That happened four years ago and the police promised to let me know when the culprits were charged. To this day, I've heard nothing. So I must assume they got off scot-free.

Then there is my dear old mum, now 80, who recently underwent a terrifying ordeal in her own home. Mum lives alone, independently, and one Saturday last year she heard banging on her front door. A gang had tried to kick it down and when they failed to do so — it's a sturdy oak door —– they tried to ram it by reversing a van into it.Fortunately, the door did not succumb. Mum was frightened. She rang the police — but they said they could not come round until the following Tuesday. As far as I'm aware, the offenders have not been caught. Hardly surprising, is it, when police take three days to respond to an emergency call?

Yet there are officers aplenty when it comes to policing 50-something women in coffee-shop queues. If I sound resentful it is because I am. As I left Borough Market last Saturday, van-loads of police were arriving.

What upsets me most is that the country needs to heal. Yet, even now, when we dare to hope that the end is in sight, it seems that Covid is pulling us apart. As a psychotherapist, I managed two safe, calm practices. These have been destroyed by lockdown. My income has been reduced by 70 per cent, just at the time when the services I offer are needed most.

I'm working hard to help those who have suffered most — the young, students and single-parent familes — to find safe, affordable help. So many of us have mental health problems and, ironically, it was because my friend's son was feeling particularly low that we decided to take that walk last Saturday to cheer him up.

Yet we walked home feeling disconsolate, wrung out, intimidated. It has made me wary. Should I even leave the garden? Now the weather brings the promise of an uplift in our spirits, mine remain at rock bottom.

How could a walk in the sunshine to lift the desperately flagging spirits of a teenage boy and two 50-something mums, with the modest reward of coffee and cake, end in such a nightmare?

How, after the year we have all endured in which we gave up our freedoms with good grace, do we now find ourselves living in a Stasi state?

A police spokesman said: 'We are aware of a social media video in which a woman alleges she was handcuffed. The woman was contacted by police and asked to provide details of the incident. However, the woman has not yet responded.

'While the Government's roadmap contains positive news, the Met's message is clear — now is not the time for complacency. Throughout the city, Londoners must continue to stick to the rules, which are fundamentally there to save lives.

'That means you must stay at home wherever possible. You should not be meeting with other households unless a support bubble is in place or you are meeting one other person for exercise.

'Officers across London will continue to take action against rule breakers, adopting the 'Four Es' process of engaging, explaining, encouraging and then enforcing.'","Mother, 51, strolled two miles to get a coffee - but fell foul of the long arm of the law",1

John Reeb, 41, from the tiny village of Archbold, Ohio, went viral after the astonishing clip showed him tearing off his shirt Hulk-style, flexing his muscles and challenging fellow players to fight him over the ball.

DailyMail.com can now reveal that Reeb, who has an extensive criminal past, is a keen golfer who played off a six handicap in high school and is known for striking the ball with power.

A friend of Reeb told DailyMail.com: 'I saw the video, and I believe he was provoked. I’ve golfed with him, he was a good player when we were in high school. He wasn’t like that high school, it was a surprise to me. Clearly he is having some issues.'

He added: 'He played off a six [handicap], I’ve never seen someone hit a three wood as far as he could. I believe he also worked as a groundskeeper at a golf course.

Fore! John Reeb, 41, from Archbold, Ohio, was arrested twice over the summer

‘He’s clearly dealing with something, which hurt me when I saw the video.’

The video that went viral this week is fast becoming a meme, with Reeb dubbed 'Full Hulk Guy' after it racked up millions of views online.

This summer alone Reeb has been arrested twice for aggressive behavior outside his home.

This included one incident where he threatened his neighbor while wearing only underpants, according to local news reports.

Reeb had been playing golf at Crooked Creek Golf Course in Michigan in July when the incident happened.

The golf course confrontation begins when Reeb, wearing a green polo and khaki shorts, is accused of stealing someone else's ball - which he clearly has no intention of returning.

'You'll leave after I don't give you a goddamn thing,' he says, holding up the ball.

Another golfer then says he isn't prepared to 'fight' on the golf course, which somehow sparks a wild reaction out of Reeb.

'I'll plant you, b**** boy,' he says. 'Now get the f*** off the cart!'

He then rips off his shirt and screams while tensing his muscles, before shouting: 'You see that! That's a dude that's been to heaven, b***h. And you want to test God?

'You f***ing come get it, s*** stack!'

However, the other golfers have clearly seen enough and eventually decide to drive away.

Fired-up Reeb - now shirtless- then shouts at other onlookers: 'Been to heaven... leave me alone!'

A worker at Crooked Creek Golf Course told DailyMail.com: 'He had started on three different people and we had to escort him off.

'We said to him to leave and not to come back again. This whole thing happened between hole 9 and hole 11.'

This is the moment Reeb went berserk during an altercation on the course

On July 26, dressed only his underwear, Reeb allegedly threatened a 26-year-old man called Christian William Griteman in his hometown, according to the Archbold Buckeye.

Police spoke with both men, and Reeb was issued a minor misdemeanor citation for disorderly conduct under the Archbold municipal code.

Just three days later at around 1.15am, police were called to reports of a shirtless Reeb apparently chasing a vehicle down the street.

On July 15 he was also charged with disorderly conduct for allegedly yelling at Archbold resident Keith Perry, 48, as he was getting into his truck to go to work early in the morning.

The police report states that Reeb spat at the truck, then tried to spit on Perry through the vehicle's open window, per the Archbold Buckeye.

August brought two more arrests for Reeb. His latest arrest was on August 10, when police attended reports about him allegedly 'causing problems with others'.

This summer alone Reeb has been arrested twice for aggressive behavior outside his home

Reeb was taken into custody and transported to the Corrections Center of Northwest Ohio. He has since been released.

Earlier in August, he was charged yet again with a misdemeanor warrant.

In November 2017, Reeb was also convicted of driving under the influence of drugs and alcohol, and ordered to do 150 hours community service and pay a $560 fine.

His other alleged crimes include speeding in a school zone in October 2007, possessing narcotics in July and December 2015, planning an intentional riot in 2022, and trespass earlier this year.

Reeb also caused a dramatic car crash in 2020 which caused him to be thrown out of his vehicle.

On June 11 of that year, Reeb was driving a Buick minivan when he failed to heed a stop sign and ploughed into the path of a Ford pick-up truck, according to The Village Reporter.

https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/feb/11/scott-morrison-leaves-open-indemnification-of-new-coal-fired-power-station,1,"Scott Morrison has left open the option of his government indemnifying a new coal plant in Collinsville from future carbon risk, despite moderate Liberals declaring there should be zero taxpayer support for the project.

With Nationals and Liberals publicly at odds over new coal investments, and whether the government’s current climate change policies need a reboot, Labor asked the prime minister in question time whether the government was prepared to give the Collinsville project a taxpayer indemnity from carbon risk.

Morrison stepped around the question from the shadow climate change minister, Mark Butler, saying that matter was “not currently before the government”.

He said the government was examining options like the Collinsville project because it wanted to deliver jobs in north Queensland, and manufacturing industries needed access “to the reliable power it needs to ensure that they can support jobs and livelihoods into the future”.

One of many obstacles preventing private investment in new coal-fired power generation is that proponents have struggled to get finance because they are unable to predict future carbon risk, particularly given Australia’s decade-long parliamentary standoff over emissions reduction policies.

In 2018, the energy minister, Angus Taylor, held open the option of providing indemnities, telling Guardian Australia the government would look to remove the risks stopping investment in new power generation.

“I’m saying we will look at whatever risks that can’t be managed by the companies that need to be managed to get investment,” he said.

“What we are saying is the risks that government needs to absorb to get investment in reliable generation, we will look at absorbing. We need the investment.”

But the case for Collinsville remains unclear. The Australian Energy Market Operator (Aemo) noted in 2018 there was currently an “energy surplus” in north Queensland, and “further large-scale generator connections are unlikely to be efficient in north Queensland until existing thermal generation in central Queensland starts to retire” in the 2030s.

Late last year, Aemo said “due to the already low cost of renewables and their firming options, and their projected future reductions”, the lowest cost replacements for emissions-intensive generation would be a “portfolio” of renewable, storage, gas-powered generation, demand management and network resources. New coal was not on the radar.

In terms of indemnities, the Ai Group argued in 2018 that net present value of fully offsetting the lifetime emissions of a new 2GW “high-efficiency low-emissions” power plant could be $17.5bn, and more than $1.3bn annually by 2030, depending on what carbon policies were ultimately adopted.

Bob Katter, the member for Kennedy, declared on Tuesday the proposal currently on the table at Collinsville “doesn’t stack up financially” and called on Nationals “to stop using the north as a plaything for their own leadership battles”.

The government’s decision on Saturday to unveil the $4m feasibility study with Shine Energy into the Collinsville proposal has reopened the Coalition’s rolling internal debate over climate action, with Sydney Liberals Trent Zimmerman and Dave Sharma arguing on Monday the federal government should not back new coal plants.

The Nationals, embroiled in internal factional brawling between supporters of Michael McCormack and the former leader Barnaby Joyce, are squaring off against those Liberals in metropolitan seats.

The former resources minister Matt Canavan, who lost his cabinet post last week after lining up behind Joyce’s unsuccessful run at McCormack’s leadership, told Tuesday’s meeting of the Coalition partyroom that MPs, meaning metropolitan Liberals, should reserve judgment on the Collinsville proposal until the results of the feasibility study were known.

Canavan and his Queensland colleague George Christensen have been arguing the Coalition’s support for coal jobs was the reason Morrison prevailed in last year’s “miracle” election. Labor suffered a rout in regional Queensland.

Canavan also heckled his former cabinet colleague Simon Birmingham in Senate question time on Tuesday. Answering a question about the status of Collinsville, Birmingham, the trade minister, told the chamber “the government is not funding a new coal-fired power station” – but Canavan interjected: “Not yet”.

After days of disunity, Scott Morrison read the riot act. He warned his MPs on Tuesday to focus on the Australian people and move past the Coalition’s “difficult period” of recent months. He said there were only “two party rooms in this building” – that of the government and that of the opposition.

Morrison said the Australian people had endorsed MPs as a “government” and that no individual was above that.

The treasurer, Josh Fyrdenberg, told colleagues he was frustrated that the “historic” visit on Monday by the Indonesian president was overshadowed by the Nationals’ turmoil, and urged them to focus on the issues that mattered to voters, including economic management and lower household power prices.

“We must all focus on those achievements and our policies and plans going forward and put internal issues of recent days behind us,” he said.",Scott Morrison leaves open indemnification of new coal-fired power station,1

The alarming scenes preceded an announcement made by New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy Monday that casinos and restaurants will be able to reopen at 25 percent capacity for the July 4th weekend.

The D’Jais Bar and Grill in Belmar was descended upon by swarms of maskless people seeking a sense of normalcy on Saturday, dancing and drinking under a packed outdoor tent as summer temperatures neared 90 degrees.

Alarmed social media users tweeted photos of the packed bar, showing hordes of people standing shoulder-to-shoulder near a station serving drinks in the D’Jais parking lot as music blared out across Ocean Avenue.

Other photos and videos showed crowds congregated out front of the bar and grill, with some social media users calling for the dwellers to be arrested for their ‘blatant disregard’ for social distancing measures.

Currently, restaurants and bars in the state are permitted to open for outdoor dining and cocktails if tables are spaced at least six-feet apart, as New Jersey - much like the rest of the US - seeks to stem the spread of coronavirus.

Following the fallout, management at D’Jais say they did observe outside dining rules outlined by local government last week, however they vowed to implement additional changes to improve social distancing.

D’Jais, which currently has its porch, patio and parking lot open, will now limit the size of parties permitted entry and will be implementing line queues to ensure patrons are safely spaced out when waiting to order drinks.

The restaurants pledge came shortly after New Jersey Mayor Mark Walsifer reprimanded the eatery, telling NJ Live how he read the riot act to the bar’s owners on Sunday morning for breaching state guidelines.

‘Saturday night they got overwhelmed. We’re working with them this coming week and if they don’t comply — guess what — they’re going to get shut down and they know it,’ Walsifer said.

The mayor added that this coming weekend, customers at D’Jais will be required to stay at their tables with only waiters and waitresses permitted to retrieve drinks.

The bar will also be forced to turn customers away when the limited number of outdoor seats are filled, Walsifer clarified.

Other photos and videos showed crowds congregated out front of the bar and grill, with others dancing in large groups under the tent late into the evening

The packed scenes inside the bar were shared widely on social media, both in video and photos

John Bonevich, the marketing manager for D’Jais, told NJ Live that packed scenes were the result of large groups of people who were renting houses in the area for the weekend coming to the bar and requesting to be sat together.

Though Bonevich concedes the bar was indeed ‘overwhelmed’, he said there was never more than approximately 120 to 150 people in the parking lot – the main seating and bar area - at any given time.

‘They’d say ""we live together"",’ Bonevich told the outlet of Saturday’s customers. ‘It’s a hard thing — young people think about the world differently. A lot came down Saturday and we had to chase a lot of people away. I’d say from 4pm to 11pm we had to tell people to go other…Everybody is excited to go places and be outdoors.’

Bonevich also said D’Jais has private security that checks identifications and also reimburses Belmar for the cost of two uniformed police officers who walk the sidewalk in front to keep people spaced apart and try to limit loitering.

He also said that customers were only permitted entry if they were wearing a face covering, but most removed the masks once they were admitted to the outdoor seating area.

‘Yesterday was much better,’ Bonevich said of Sunday. ‘It’s a work in progress. People are pretty civil, it’s more laid back now.’

The controversial on goings at D’Jais came just 48 hours before state Governor Phil Murphy announced plans that indoor dining could resume on July 2 at 25 percent. Casinos are also permitted to reopen at the same capacity cap.

Murphy himself has been known to frequent D’Jais, even uploading a photo with his wife last Memorial Day insisting there’s ‘no better place to kick off the Memorial Day Weekend than the legendary D’Jais in Belmar’.

The governor’s announcement was made in a Monday afternoon tweet, which read: ‘Casinos will be permitted to open on July 2nd at 25% capacity.

‘If any visitor refuses to comply with our simple safeguards, they'll be escorted out. We’re not going to tolerate any knuckleheads trying to ruin it for those who wish to enjoy themselves responsibly.’

Murphy also added that outdoor gatherings will now be permitted to increase from 100 to 250 people, with still no limit placed on religious or political events.

Indoor gatherings, meanwhile, are now limited to a 25 percent capacity that must not exceed 100 people.

Murphy said he expects to release further guidelines in the next several days. Unlike Governor Cuomo of New York’s plan, Governor Murphy’s phased reopening is not tied to specific benchmarks but rather general downward trends.

The state previously gave the greenlight for restaurants to conduct outdoor dining and for some retail stores to resume operations on June 15. New Jersey restaurants closed for in-person dining in mid-March but were still able to offer takeout and delivery.

Many restaurants shut down completely, unable to make enough money to stay open on takeout revenue alone.

The city's nine casinos have been waiting for a reopening date for weeks, even as casinos in other states reopened.

'We're delighted to get the reopening date,' said Joe Lupo, president of the Hard Rock casino to NBC 4. 'We thank the governor that we'll be able to be open for the July 4th weekend to meet the demand on the world-famous Atlantic City Boardwalk.'

In New York City, outdoor dining is now permitted under the state’s second phase of reopening. Indoor dining at a 50-percent capacity will begin in the third phase – likely to commence early July.

Gov. Murphy also celebrated on Twitter that his state was one of five to be on track to contain COVID-19.

Mya Thwet Thwet Khine, who turned 20 last Thursday as she lay unconscious in a hospital bed, fought for her life for ten days after she was shot by Myanmar troops during a demonstration in the capital Naypyitaw on February 9.

She is the first protester to be killed since Myanmar's army seized power on February 1 and detained elected leader Aung San Suu Kyi.

Video showed the young woman sheltering from water cannons and suddenly dropping to the ground after a bullet penetrated a motorcycle helmet she had been wearing.

A body bag, containing the remains of the young woman, Mya Thwet Thwet Khine, is brought out of the 1000-Bed General Hospital, in Naypyitaw, Myanmar on Friday, February 19, 2021

Shot in the head: Myanmar protester Mya Thwe Thwe Kaing lies injured after she was shot during a protest in Myanmar's capital Naypyidaw on February 9. She died on Friday morning

The screenshot captures the moment Mya Thwet Thwet Khine was shot by Myanmar troops during a demonstration in the capital of Myanmar, Naypyitaw, on February 9

Mya had been on life support at a hospital with what doctors had said was no chance of recovery.

Her brother, Ye Htut Aung, who spoke to The Associated Press from a mortuary, said she died at 11.05am local time on Friday.

A source at Naypyitaw's 1000-Bed General Hospital, speaking on condition on anonymity because of fear of harassment from the authorities, confirmed her death.

A spokesman for the ruling military did not deny the woman had been shot by security forces, but said at a news conference this week that she was one of the crowd that had thrown rocks at police and the case was under investigation.

There were no independent accounts of her taking part in any violence.

After fighting for her life for ten days at hospital, the 20-year-old Myanmar protester succumbed to death on February 19 after suffering from a gunshot wound in her head

Protesters had already hailed Mya Thwet Thwet Khine as a hero and commemorated her during demonstrations earlier this week.

News of her death is likely to inflame passions even more in the nonviolent protest movement, which embraces civil disobedience.

The military justified the power grab by claiming widespread voter fraud in the November polls, which saw a landslide for Suu Kyi and her party. It quickly moved to stack courts and political offices with loyalists.

Since then, medical staff, air traffic controllers and teachers have staged strikes, turned up for work while wearing red ribbons on their uniforms or posed for photos while brandishing the three-finger salute adopted by the anti-coup movement.

Protesters on the streets have called for the release of Suu Kyi - who has not been publicly seen since she and other top political leaders were detained - and for the generals to respect the results of the last election.

Demonstrations continued Friday in Yangon, the country's biggest city, and elsewhere.

Security forces so far have been relatively restrained on confronting protesters in Yangon, but appeared to be toughening their stance in locations where there is less media presence.

Police used force for a second straight day to arrest protesters in Myitkyina, the capital of the remote northern state of Kachin.

The Kachin ethnic minority has long been at odds with the central government, and there has been intermittent armed struggle against the army there for decades.

On Thursday night in the southeastern city of Dawei, local media reported that several people were wounded by rubber bullets when police staged nighttime raids to try to arrest some activists.

Large but peaceful protest marches have taken place in the city, with negotiations between the demonstrators and the authorities to avoid confrontations.

Tom Andrews, the independent U.N. human rights expert on Myanmar, told The Associated Press this week that the initial restraint of police dealing with 'robust citizen opposition to the coup' has moved in some instances to use of rubber bullets, real ammunition and water cannons.

Speaking from the United States, he also said 'hardened' troops were being deployed from border areas to some cities, raising the possibility of bloodshed and 'a tragic loss of life.'

The junta has said it took over - after detaining the nation's leader Aung San Suu Kyi and others and preventing Parliament from convening - because elections last November were tainted by voting irregularities.

The election outcome, which Suu Kyi's party won by a landslide, was affirmed by an election commission that has since been replaced by the military. The junta says it will hold new elections in a year´s time.

The US, Britain and Canadian governments have imposed sanctions on Myanmar's new military leaders, and they and other governments have called for Suu Kyi's administration to be restored.

European Union foreign policy chief Josep Borrell warned the bloc could impose fresh sanctions on Myanmar's military, but said any measures should be targeted to avoid hitting the wider population.

New Zealand became the first country taking action to isolate the junta by suspending high-level military and political contacts with Myanmar.

The coup was a major setback to Myanmar's transition to democracy after 50 years of army rule.

https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/dec/08/ex-officer-trial-shooting-daunte-wright,1,"The suburban Minneapolis police officer who killed Daunte Wright violated her training and “betrayed a 20-year-old kid” when she shot him with a handgun instead of a Taser during a traffic stop, a prosecutor told jurors Wednesday.

Prosecutor Erin Eldridge began her opening statement at former Brooklyn Center officer Kim Potter’s manslaughter trial by telling jurors that a police officer’s fundamental duty is to protect the sanctity of life. She also said Potter had received extensive training, including in risks of firing the wrong weapon.

“This is exactly what she had been trained for years to prevent,” prosecutor Erin Eldridge said. “But on April 11, she betrayed her badge and she failed Daunte Wright.”

Potter, 49, is charged with first-degree and second-degree manslaughter in Wright’s death in Brooklyn Center. Potter is white and Wright was Black. The former officer, who resigned two days after the shooting, has said she meant to use her Taser on Wright after he tried to drive away from a traffic stop as officers tried to arrest him, but that she grabbed her handgun instead.

Her body camera recorded the shooting.

Defense attorney Paul Engh said during his opening statement that Potter made a mistake, but claimed Potter “had to do what she had to do to prevent a death to a fellow officer”.

Prosecutors argue that Potter was trained explicitly about the danger of avoiding deadly mix-ups.

“We trust them to know wrong from right, and left from right,” Eldridge said. “This case is about an officer who knew not to get it dead wrong, but she failed to get it right.”

Engh, though, argued that she made an error, saying, “Police officers are human beings.” And he appeared to cast blame on Wright, saying all the 20-year-old had to do that day was surrender.

A mostly white jury was seated last week in a case that sparked angry demonstrations outside the Brooklyn Center police station last spring. Those demonstrations, with protesters frequently clashing with police in riot gear, happened as former Minneapolis officer Derek Chauvin was on trial just 10 miles (16 kilometers) away for killing George Floyd.

Potter was training a new officer when they pulled Wright over for having expired license plate tags and an air freshener hanging from the rearview mirror, according to a criminal complaint.

When they found that Wright had an outstanding arrest warrant, they tried to arrest him but he got back into his car instead of cooperating. Potter’s body-camera video recorded her shouting “Taser, Taser, Taser” and “I’ll tase you” before she fired once with her handgun.

Eldridge played extended body-camera video from the shooting, including the moments right after Potter shot Wright.

Her camera recorded her saying “(expletive) I just shot him” and “I grabbed the wrong (expletive) gun.” After his car rolled away, it shows Potter sink to the curb and sit down, further exclaiming “Oh my God.” Defense attorneys argued in pretrial filings that her immediate reaction bolsters their argument that the shooting was a tragic accident.

But defense attorneys also have asserted that Potter was within her rights to use deadly force if she had consciously chosen to do so because Wright’s actions endangered other officers at the scene.

“She believed the use of a Taser was appropriate when she saw Mr Wright’s abject denial of his lawful arrest coupled with his attempted flight,” Engh wrote in a pretrial filing seeking to dismiss one of the charges. “She could have shot him.”

Wright’s mother, Katie Bryant, testified about the moment she saw her son lying in his car after he’d been shot. She said she tried to contact him through a video call after losing an earlier phone connection, and that a woman answered and screamed, “They shot him!” and pointed the phone toward the driver’s seat.

“And my son was laying there. He was unresponsive and he looked dead,” Bryant said through tears.

A jury of 14 people, including two white alternates, will hear the case. Nine of the 12 jurors likely to deliberate are white, one is Black and two are Asian.

The jury’s racial makeup is roughly in line with the demographics of Hennepin county, which is about 74% white. But the jury is notably less diverse than the one that convicted Chauvin in Floyd’s killing.

Potter has told the court she will testify.

The most serious charge against Potter requires prosecutors to prove recklessness, while the lesser requires them to prove culpable negligence. Minnesota’s sentencing guidelines call for a prison term of just over seven years on the first-degree manslaughter count and four years on the second-degree one. Prosecutors have said they will seek a longer sentence.","Daunte Wright killing: ex-officer Kim Potter violated her training, say prosecutors",1

Four officers were injured and treated at the scene by paramedics as footage captured on Sunday night showed objects being thrown at police cars.

Yesterday the organisers of the event on Greatstone Beach in Romney Marsh admitted the event 'got out of hand,' as families were told to leave the packed seafront but said the rave was not illegal.

One officer could be seen falling to the ground, with two revellers rushing to pick him back up, after a car reversed and maneuvered around crowds and parked vehicles.

Kent Police say there was an 'altercation,' in the car park and a 29-year-old man from London was arrested.

Crowds packed onto Greatstone Beach in Romney Marsh, Kent on Sunday for a beach cookout rave that turned violent and left four police officers with injuries

The event's organisers, from jerk chicken eatery Flavour Boss, based in Croydon, south London, yesterday admitted that the party - for which they arranged three coaches to transport revellers down from London - had 'got out of hand'.

The party, on Greatstone beach, started at around 3.30pm and came after plans for an unofficial 'beach cookout' on Sunday night in nearby Camber Sands, East Sussex, were foiled by police.

Families enjoying a day out on the beach were forced to leave due to the sheer volume of revellers failing to take any measures to protect themselves or those around them.

Objects were thrown at police vehicles while a car was seen driving erratically around crowds following the event on Sunday

In chaotic scenes, a police officer could be seen falling to the floor as a car drove erratically around crowds and other vehicles at the 'cookout' rave in Romney Marsh on Sunday. Two revellers stopped to pick up the officer

When the last of the partygoers finally departed, at around 10pm, they left litter - including plastic bags, drink cans and fast-food containers - strewn across a vast swathe of the beach.

Flavour Boss, which has denied the event was 'illegal', arranged transport to the Camber Sands rave for £27.54 per ticket, up until Friday - but it was re-arranged further along the coastline after details about the original secret location were leaked on social media.

The hosts hired three coaches from London - each with around 40 people on board - to take revellers to the Kent coast which were all sold out, according to Kent Online.

Two of the coaches are understood to have travelled from Watford, in Hertfordshire - and one resident claimed that a bus owned by a London borough council had also been used as transportation. Images taken inside one of the coaches show partygoers not wearing any masks.

The event, on Greatstone beach (above), started at around 3.30pm, and came after plans for an unofficial 'beach cookout' on Sunday evening in nearby Camber Sands, East Sussex, were foiled by police

Promoters in association with jerk chicken eatery Flavour Boss, based in South London, arranged transport to the Camber Sands rave for £27.54 per ticket, up until Friday. But the party was re-arranged further along the coastline after details about the original secret location were leaked on social media

One witness said huge crowds remained on the beach past 10pm, adding: 'Just come thru Greatstone, unbelievable scenes, chaos on the road, police everywhere... was good natured, it wasn't a place for families'

Flavour Boss director Orette Williams said the money was to cover the three coach-loads of people who attended the event and the company gave out food free of charge.

The event - advertised online as taking place at a 'secret beach location' - was attended by police and ambulance crews. One witness described seeing officers in riot gear.

Under current government Covid-19 guidelines, it is against the law to hold a gathering of more than 30 people without permission from the local authority and police.

Mr Williams said he was given permission for the event but it was withdrawn 48 hours beforehand after police found out that coach-loads of people would be attending.

'It did get a bit out of hand, with regards to the social distancing,' he said.

He added that he had been given 'mixed signals' by Folkstone and Hythe District Council, which he said gave permission for a gathering that followed social distancing rules.

'We were stuck between a rock and a hard place. What was I going to do? I was going to lose £2,000 on the coaches,' he said.

'We don't host illegal gatherings, we did not break the law - the police knew this event was taking place. They were there from the start.'

Litter lies strewn across Greatstone beach after revellers finally left. Although the party was supposed to end at 8.30pm, some partygoers did not leave until 10pm

However, Cllr David Monk, Leader of Folkestone & Hythe District Council, said today: 'This gathering was arranged at short notice with the details withheld from us and police colleagues.

'There were no mixed signals. No permission was granted by the council for this gathering or for the use of its land. The council was not in direct contact with the organiser before the event took place.

'The sheer amount of rubbish left behind is disgusting. Our waste crews have been on site all morning and continue to work hard to clean the area. We would also like to thank members of the local community for mucking in to help clean up.

'We've already made contact with the organiser to discuss the consequences of this gathering and we are considering legal action.'

The Camber Sands event was described as 'private' with no alcohol or food being sold, and the first release of 'coach tickets' sold out, according to Kent Live.

Rother Police confirmed that permission to hold the East Sussex rave had not been granted.

One beach-goer said: 'It was enough to force me and family, as well as other families off the beach, no social distancing.'

Meanwhile, a resident told Kent Online they saw minibuses parked up, suggesting that party-goers used additional transport to attend.

And one witness said huge crowds remained on the beach past 10pm, adding: 'Just come thru Greatstone, unbelievable scenes, chaos on the road, police everywhere... was good natured, it wasn't a place for families.'

Wayne Williams, who works at the Flavour Boss jerk chicken shop in Croydon, told MailOnline: 'The police asked us to pack up and end the event by 8.30pm. But because it would take about an hour for people to disperse, I actually sugggested 7.30pm to give people the chance to leave.'

Kent Police said a 29-year-old man from London was arrested following reports of an altercation at around 9pm in a car park near the beach. Four attending officers sustained injuries during the incident and were treated at the scene by the South East Coast Ambulance Service. (Above, police in the Romney Marsh area on Sunday night)

A spokesperson from Kent Police told MailOnline today: 'Kent Police is investigating a disturbance in Greatstone and reminding the public of their responsibility to keep a safe distance from one another to prevent the spread of Covid-19.

'Officers were called to reports of a large gathering on Greatstone beach at around midday on Sunday 9 August. The event was pre-planned - however, Kent Police had not been made aware of the exact location until the group arrived.

'Patrols attended the area where they engaged with a number of individuals throughout the day to explain and encourage compliance with the latest Government guidance and address reports of anti-social behaviour.

'Those attending the location were asked to consider the wider community and their personal responsibilities in order to control the spread of the virus.'

'At around 9pm, there was a report of an altercation in a nearby car park. Four attending officers sustained injuries during the incident and were treated at the scene by the South East Coast Ambulance Service. A 29-year-old man from London was arrested.'

A post on Folkestone and Hythe District Council's Facebook page said police remained in the area on patrol throughout the evening.

It said: 'We are aware of the large unauthorised gathering taking place at Greatstone beach. It is causing delays in the area so please bear this in mind if you have travel plans.

'Kent Police is reminding those attending of the latest government advice around social distancing and encouraging them to adhere to it. Officers will remain in the area as part of their patrols.'",Shocking moment partygoers throw objects at police at illegal 'cookout' rave on Kent beach,1

22 Jun 2023 09.30 BST Speakman queries police explanation for silence over Tasering of Claire Nowland NSW opposition leader, Mark Speakman, today again questioned the police commissioner’s explanation for why the public was not told for two days about the Tasering of 95-year-old Claire Nowland. NSW police commissioner, Karen Webb, said the priority was to ensure Nowland’s family was informed directly and the integrity of the investigation was maintained. But Opposition leader Mark Speakman cast doubt on that theory today: You can put plenty of labels on it but there is a lack of accountability and a lack of transparency. There was an initial failure to disclose that Mrs Nowland had tragically been Tasered. That delay took up to 54 hours and although a reason has been offered that they needed to talk to the family, it hasn’t been explained why it took up to 54 hours. Following AAP revealing yesterday that several key details were slashed from the first public statement about the incident, Speakman said police could have mentioned the Taser and other details while de-identifying Nowland. Police minister Yasmin Catley deflected a barrage of questions in parliament today about when she saw the first police statement and when Nowland’s next of kin were informed. The minister reiterated the police decision to not release “graphic details” until the family was fully informed and stressed the steps police took to ensure the incident was properly investigated.

Claire Gorman, the ABC’s head of international services, told the inquiry into supporting democracy in the region that China is spending at least $3bn a year on international media, compared with $11m for the ABC. Extra funding due to roll out from July means the national broadcaster “stands ready” to do more to advance democracy, civil society and peace, she said.

22 Jun 2023 08.41 BST UN report criticises religious exemption laws for increasing anti-LGBTQ+ discrimination A report by the UN has called out Australia’s religious exemption laws for increasing discrimination against LGBTQ+ people by faith-based service providers and religious schools. The report, by independent expert on protection against violence and discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity, Victor Madrigal-Borloz, said it had learned of several cases in Australia where religious schools in Australia have fired teachers because of their sexual orientation. Madrigal-Borloz wrote: Some States justify their acquiescence of such dismissals on the grounds that religious institutions should have autonomy in their internal administration, admissions policies, and curricula. This claim, however, can hinder the successful implementation of plans and programs intended to promote diversity-oriented education, comprehensive sexuality education, and gender equality. Equality Australia legal director, Ghassan Kassisieh, said the report showed protections were urgently needed for LGBTQI+ people: These discriminatory practices are not theoretical or academic. One in three students and almost two in five school employees are employed in non-government schools, most of which are religiously affiliated. Two out of the four adoption providers in NSW explicitly state on their website that you are unable to adopt a child if you are a same-sex couple, thanks to gaps in our legal protections.

On Monday the Greens voted with the Coalition to delay consideration of Labor’s $10bn Housing Australia Future Fund (Haff) until 16 October, despite pressure from housing groups to pass the bill after the government pledged $2bn of direct funding for social and affordable housing. The Greens and Coalition teamed up again on Thursday to establish the inquiry, which will provide an interim report by 23 September to provide input into the national cabinet process considering renters’ rights set up by the Albanese government.

22 Jun 2023 07.38 BST Elias Visontay ACCC flags concern over effect of Qantas and Emirates partnership on competition The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission has raised concern that Qantas’ partnership with Emirates is affecting competition on a key route between Australia and New Zealand, but has found that extending the coordination will benefit the public. On Thursday afternoon, the ACCC announced it had issued a draft determination proposing to authorise Qantas (including Jetstar) and Emirates to continue their coordination operation for a further five years. The codeshare alliance was first authorised in 2013, and has allowed the airlines to coordinate passenger and cargo transport operations across their respective networks. The ACCC commissioner, Anna Brakey, said public benefits would include “increased connectivity and convenience and greater loyalty program benefits for consumers”. “The coordination will give customers greater choice of flight times and flexibility when travelling on routes where the operations of Qantas and Emirates overlap.” However, the ACCC flagged the continued alliance could harm competition on flights between Sydney and Christchurch, because Air New Zealand is the only other airline operating on that route. “We have included a condition in the draft approval, requiring Qantas and Emirates to provide the ACCC with information so we can monitor the competitive dynamics on this route during the term of authorisation,” Brakey said.

In response, ballet management has decided to cancel a one-off bonus performance of a new short work that was scheduled to take place after Friday night’s show, in a move the dancers’ union, the Media Entertainment and Arts Alliance, has called “punitive”, but management said was unavoidable, given the scheduled performance would now run overtime.

22 Jun 2023 07.12 BST Labor livid as Greens and Coalition unite to refer bill on ACT hospital inquiry to its own inquiry Paul Karp Labor are livid that earlier today the Greens and Coalition voted in the Senate to refer Matt Canavan’s bill about the Calvary hospital takeover to an inquiry. The bill, if passed, would require the Australian Capital Territory to have an inquiry into the proposed takeover, reporting by 30 June 2024. This is an odd alliance, because the Greens are in Andrew Barr’s ACT government, so the federal Greens are supporting an inquiry into a bill that would establish an inquiry into something the ACT Greens are jointly responsible for. Adam Bandt told reporters in Canberra this was a “run-of-the-mill matter of Senate procedure; there is a longstanding practice in this place where private members’ bills are able to be referred to an inquiry”. Bandt denied that the Greens got something in return for it. Bandt said the Greens position was “crystal clear”. Asked if the minor party was buying into a culture war, he said: “Absolutely not.” Labor is concerned that the inquiry is being driven by people who view the hospital takeover as an attack on religion, meaning it will give a platform to those who want abortion and trans rights restricted.

https://www.theguardian.com/society/2021/mar/25/charlie-phillips-why-did-one-of-britains-great-photo-portraitists-end-up-homeless,1,"Charlie Phillips never planned to become a photographer. His childhood dream was to be an opera singer, or a naval architect. But then a camera fell into his lap. It was 1958. The 14-year-old had arrived from Jamaica two years earlier and was living in Notting Hill, west London, at that time the first port of call for many Caribbean immigrants. The area was also a destination for African American soldiers stationed at nearby military bases, who didn’t feel so welcome in central London’s white venues.

“On Saturdays, if you had a basement flat, you’d move the furniture to one side and make a party,” says Phillips. “And these GIs used to bring their rhythm-and-blues records and cigarettes. They’d come to have a good time and, you know, dance … and the young Afro-Caribbean women would come to meet them.” Phillips’s family often befriended these GIs. “One of them got legless one night and couldn’t get back to his base, so he had to borrow 15 shillings from my dad. He left behind a Kodak Retinette camera, but he never came back to pick it up. So I kept it.”

That camera became Phillips’s passport to a career that took him across Europe and into contact with notable figures including Jimi Hendrix, Federico Fellini, Muhammad Ali and Henri Cartier-Bresson. At the same time, Phillips was one of the few people minded and able to document London’s African-Caribbean community. His images, many of which were gathered together in the book Notting Hill in the Sixties, capture the richness and complexity of the landscape. Children play on litter-filled streets; young Black people show off their fashionable attire outside rundown houses.

This was an era marked by regular racist assaults on the African-Caribbean community, and the 1958 Notting Hill “race riots”. Phillips’s images show hand-scrawled adverts for rooms to let, spelling out “No coloured”, and graffiti on walls reading “Keep Britain white”. But his work also captures black and white Londoners socialising together, laughing, drinking, kissing. One of his best-known photographs, known as Notting Hill Couple, has come to symbolise that spirit. Taken at a party in 1967, it depicts a young Black man with his arm around a young white woman. Both look into the camera with serious expressions that could be interpreted as hopeful, innocent, perhaps even defiant.

Phillips chronicled African-Caribbean funerals in London over several generations, in all their passion, style and sartorial exuberance. This was his own community, and his images speak of an insider’s intimacy and familiarity. “As far as I’m concerned, we haven’t been given a proper platform to show our culture, our side of the story,” he says. “It’s not Black history; this is British history, whether you like it or not. And we’ve been sidestepped. I feel that personally.”

Phillips has good reason to feel excluded. As well as that fateful camera, his career has been shaped to some extent by British attitudes towards race. Like many Windrush-era immigrants, his family did not come to Britain because they were poor but because they were invited. In Jamaica, his parents ran a business making tourist souvenirs, employing six other people. “The mother country called, so we answered,” he says. “But we never had any welcoming party; we had to fend for ourselves.” The now-gentrified Notting Hill was “a ghetto” at that time, populated not only by Caribbean but also Irish and Hungarian immigrants. Phillips’s first accommodation was a boarding house in Blenheim Crescent, where he slept three to a bed with other recent arrivals. Later, his parents would move into a room, then two rooms in a shared house.

At school, Phillips’s mostly white classmates were less hostile than curious, he says. “They would call me ‘Curly’ and sometimes feel your hair. There were rumours that we had tails on our backs.” Phillips was surprised by their ignorance. “I’d say: ‘I’m from Jamaica.’ They’d say: ‘What part of Africa is that?’ The British empire was all over the world, and yet some of the local population was so ignorant about the colonies. It was unbelievable.” His teachers were equally surprised that Phillips knew how to read, write, draw, do geometry and even sing Ave Maria in Latin. He had a good voice, he says. He also had a fascination with ships; in his free time he would take the bus to Victoria Docks to watch them. But as a Black child in 50s Britain, Phillips’s dreams of designing ships or singing opera were not considered realistic. “They laughed at me. The youth employment officer said: ‘Why don’t you get a job with London Transport? That’s more security. Or join the RAF or get a job with the post office.’”

To pass the evenings in his family’s one-bedroom flat, Phillips began to take an interest in the camera. With money from his paper round, he bought a do-it-yourself photography book from the local chemist. He began developing his prints at night in the bath after everyone else had gone to bed. His first photographs were of friends and family in the neighbourhood, who would pay for a photo to send to relatives back home. “I used to take ‘snaps’ of people,” he says. “We never called them ‘photographs’ in them days. It was just for fun, as an amateur, because we only thought we’d spend five years in England.” After leaving school in 1960, he bought a better camera and continued his DIY photography education. He never had any formal training. “It was just common sense. This is how I picked up my trade.”

By the mid-60s Phillips’s parents were running a Caribbean restaurant in Portobello Road where he would help out. In his free time he snapped other aspects of local life: people and scenes on the street, events such as the Jamaican Independence Day celebrations in 1962. He would take his camera along to student protest marches against nuclear weapons, apartheid and the Vietnam war. In solidarity with the student uprising of 1968, he decided to take a boat to France to see what was going on in Paris. “I’ll always remember, I was outside the Gare du Nord, and it was a big student riot and the police were there, and a student got his head busted in. I saw the blood spurting, and I got panicky. It still shakes me up.” He decided to hitchhike around Europe, and ended up in Rome.

The term “paparazzo” had been coined eight years earlier by Fellini in the movie La Dolce Vita, which mapped a postwar Rome of frenetic modernity and celebrity culture. Phillips found himself living that life for real, hanging around with genuine paparazzi in cafes or outside film studios, waiting for a tip or a sighting of a passing star to snap: Marcello Mastroianni, Omar Sharif, Gina Lollobrigida, John Mills, Peter O’Toole, spaghetti western actors – Phillips got them all. Claudia Cardinale was especially friendly, he says. She once gave him tickets to the premiere of Oliver!. Lesser-known actors would pay to be photographed for their own portfolios.

It was an exciting, if hand-to-mouth lifestyle. “An agency would take some of my work. You’d get two or three quid, which was survival.” He even met Fellini himself, who cast him as an extra in his 1969 film Satyricon. Easygoing and conversational, Phillips seems to have made friends wherever he went. “Sometimes in my travels, people took a liking to me,” he acknowledges. “That’s how I survived. Seeing as I was the only person of colour, everybody was curious: who’s this Black guy taking photographs?”

Phillips still harboured dreams of opera, despite living in a commune with Italian revolutionaries who considered it “borghese”, or bourgeois. He often worked as an extra at La Scala, an opera house in Milan. But as a photographer, he was doing pretty well. He sold work to Italian magazines including Vogue, Harper’s Bazaar and Life. He would travel to ski resorts or to the south of France as a paparazzo. And he was travelling back and forth to England. “This is when I started photographing my community in a more serious fashion,” he says. As well as the streets and the Caribbean funerals, he visited the pubs, the shebeens (illegal drinking clubs) and nightclubs such as the Cue Club in Paddington, a venue for soul and bluebeat (early ska music), which was frequented by Black celebrities and rock stars. “I was in the alternative culture of London at the time,” he says. “The sex, drugs and rock’n’roll era, the free love era.” He captured rock stars such as Hendrix and Eric Clapton visiting the head shops and fashion boutiques in Portobello Road. He spent more time with Hendrix and others at the Isle of Wight festival in 1970. “I managed to get backstage. I had photographs with Hendrix, Joan Baez, Tiny Tim, I think some of the Who were there, Sly and the Family Stone.”

In 1972 Phillips held his first solo exhibition – on Notting Hill life – in Milan. To his surprise, the show was visited by Cartier-Bresson, the godfather of street photography and one of Phillips’s idols. “As a matter of fact, I used to dress like Cartier-Bresson. I used to wear a beret at the time. Some of my Italian friends used to compare my work with his.”

By 1974, Phillips was getting homesick and decided to return to England, but again, there was no welcoming party. Showing his photographs to editors and galleries in London, “people would say: ‘Did you really take this?’ Nobody believed I took them. I used to get fobbed off all the time. I couldn’t get any assignments.” One gallery even had a photograph of Muhammad Ali, taken by Phillips, on the wall (taken in Zurich in 1971, during Ali’s bout with German champion Jürgen Blin; Phillips went on to meet Ali on numerous occasions) yet refused to believe Phillips was the photographer. “This is how absurd it was.” Did the fact that Phillips was Black have a bearing on his treatment? “I can’t comment on that,” he says. “I think that’s a question you should ask the institutions.”

Phillips grew demoralised. “I became homeless. And I became kind of destitute. I ended up washing up dishes and working in a cafe and restaurant and I put the photography aside.” From 1974 until 1991, Phillips didn’t take a single photograph. Making matters worse, moving between various squats and bedsits, he lost many of his photographs. His images of Hendrix, Cartier-Bresson, the Paris 1968 protests, the Dolce Vita movie stars and so many others are now missing. “If anyone can find my Jimi Hendrix collection, that’s my pension fund.”

In 1988 Phillips opened a Caribbean diner, Smokey Joe’s, in south London, which he ran for 11 years. During that time, his previous career underwent a process of rediscovery. A music magazine contacted him in 1991, seeking to use his photographs from the bluebeat era, he says. By chance, when a courier returned Phillips’s photographs to his diner, one of his customers was Ben Bousquet, a local Labour councillor. Bousquet, originally from St Lucia, had also grown up in 60s Notting Hill. He was amazed when he discovered Phillips’s archive of London immigrant life, which had lain forgotten in a box under his bed. “He said: ‘Bloody ’ell. You mean you have all these photographs sitting there? This is history here!’”

That led to the Notting Hill in the Sixties book, and a steady career rehabilitation. In 2003, the Museum of London exhibited Phillips’s work, and it has featured regularly in exhibitions since then. His photograph of the young Notting Hill couple is now part of the V&A’s collection. Simon Schama included Phillips’s work in his book and TV series The Face of Britain, describing him as “one of Britain’s great photo-portraitists”. Just last year, Steve McQueen requested Phillips take his portrait when he guest-edited the Observer. Phillips is somewhat ambivalent about his newfound recognition, however, especially when he is pigeonholed as Black culture, rather than just culture. “I feel sometimes I’m being used as political propaganda when they talk about multicultural Britain. I’m sorry, I don’t want to play the colour game. I’m tired of ticking the boxes, because they only call you in Black History Month to show images of Black people, and I’m fed up of it.”

Phillips still takes pictures, he says, but just for himself, “as a hobby”. Occasionally he travels down to the coast to photograph ships. He loves photographing horses. “I still haven’t taken the perfect photograph yet,” he says. “I still make a lot of mistakes.” He now lives in Mitcham, just outside London. “Nothing happens over here. Everything finishes after the News at 10,” he jokes. “All I wanted to do was to spend more time in my allotment and catch up on my reading. I’ve been reading War and Peace for about the last 20 years and I still haven’t finished it yet. But they took me out of retirement because people think I’ve got an interesting life.”

In 2015, he received a Heritage Lottery Fund grant to manage his archive. “This is the only thing that keeps me going. I’ve got lots of young volunteers who say: ‘Uncle Charlie, you’ve got to keep your legacy alive, because we don’t see this in schools. We don’t see this in exhibition centres.’ I think we’re not well-represented within the culture of England how we should be. There has been a missing section in our history. Most of our records have been destroyed or weren’t there in the first place … I’m just here to document our side of the story.”",Charlie Phillips: why did one of Britain's great photo-portraitists end up homeless?,1

On July 7, four goats were pictured waiting in line outside Just Jents barbershop in the town.

The cheeky animals might be waiting a while as hairdressers in Wales are not set to reopen until Monday.

Family intervention worker Brian Lane, 58, noticed the peculiar sight as he went out for an evening stroll and snapped the photo around 10pm.

The dad-of-three said: 'I had parked up to go for a little walk. It was tipping down with rain when I saw these goats under the shelter by the hairdressers.

'I just realised how they were standing. The one sitting in the front waiting to go in and the other three spaced out behind.'

He added: 'Waiting for the barbers to open, or the baa baas, it just seemed to fit a moment.'

The goats usually live on the Great Orme country park just outside the town but since lockdown they have started to wander through the deserted streets.

In March, the wild mountain goats came down to the centre of town to take advantage of the empty streets during lockdown

Mr Lane said: 'They were presented to us by Queen Victoria as a gift. They are Kashmiri goats. There is quite a population at the moment.

'The Royal Welsh Fusiliers always take one as a regimental mascot.

'They come into town but mainly on the shore where it is quieter. Once lockdown started they came down to the centre of town.'

A few weeks into lockdown in March, the wild goats descended on the quiet town and were seen feasting on bushes while residents stayed home.

They spent the final weekend in March gathered in Trinity Square.

It is believed the animals had come to the town as they wait for the spring growth of grass, and have been wandering the streets due to a lack of residents and tourists.

Andrew Stuart, who has lived in Llandudno for 22 years, saw the goats in March and called the police after he noticed the animals near his home.

He said on Twitter: 'I think I just got a group of goats in Llandudno arrested.'

Mr Stuart said he noticed the goats having 'a midnight feast' on hedges as he joked the herd were breaking isolation rules by gathering in a large group and not keeping the required two metres apart.

In another tweet, he said: 'They were probably going to run riot on the town, what with nobody being about due to the lockdown.

Nathan Scott, 32, and Sophie Evans, 20, were part of a violent crowd that smashed nearly all the windows of a home in Caia Park on Wynnstay Avenue, Wrexham, last year in April.

A door was damaged and a burning pizza box was also pushed through the letterbox of the house, leading to riot police being called.

Scott and Evans, both of Wrexham, were found guilty of violent disorder for their roles in the trouble.

Scott, who called the jury 'paedophile lovers', when he was found guilty at an earlier hearing of violent disorder, was jailed for three and a half years.

Nathan Scott, 32, who is a father-of-one, was given a three-and-a-half year prison sentence

Sophie Evans, 20, from Wrexham, was jailed for 16 months by a judge at Caernarfon Crown Court

His co-accused Evans was jailed for 16 months by a judge at Caernarfon Crown Court.

Paul Smith, defending the father-of-one Scott, said his client was not at the scene from the start but arrived with his dog an hour into the disturbance.

He said Scott 'may have been loud' and 'said a lot of things' but was not a ringleader in the trouble at the house.

John Wyn Williams, defending Evans, said she was 'ashamed' of her actions and that she was a 'young woman that's still maturing'.

He added: 'Her involvement is limited to threats alone. Her family tried to dissuade her from attending but there was an element of bravado driven from the emotion of the moment.'

Judge Niclas Parry told them that 'ill-informed knowledge' led to 'an appalling incident of violent disorder'.

'The residents of Caia Park were subjected to an appalling incident of violent disorder which began as a peaceful protest based on ill-informed knowledge involving some 30 people,' he said.

'It escalated into what can only be described as a large scale public disorder lasting for hours with as many as 400 people there.

'Heavily outnumbered by as many as four-to-one, even after reinforcements arrived, the police realised the incident was suddenly a so-called ""critical incident"".

'Reinforcements were drafted from the far corners of north Wales on an emergency basis.'

Judge Parry added that Scott shouted a series of threats to hurt the family and urged protestors, including children, to resist police who tried to disperse the crowd.

He said: 'Your attitude to authority was only underlined when on hearing the verdict in your trial. You stood and hurled verbal abuse at the jury, accusing them of being paedophile lovers.'

He told Evans: 'You were clearly enjoying the extreme difficulties the police were experiencing and you were clearly seen chanting with the crowd.'

Both Evans and Scott were also handed a five-year restraining order banning of them from contacting any of the victims or mentioning them on social media.",Two vigilantes are jailed over joining false 400-strong 'paedophile protest' mob,1

The former president made the show of bravado ahead of his first appearance in the case which is dividing an already deeply polarised America.

According to the indictment, Mr Trump and six co-conspirators orchestrated a plot to overturn the results of the election, which he lost to Joe Biden.

As he left his golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey, Mr Trump wrote on his Truth Social account: 'I AM NOW GOING TO WASHINGTON D.C., TO BE ARRESTED FOR HAVING CHALLENGED A CORRUPT, RIGGED, AND STOLEN ELECTION. IT IS A GREAT HONOR BECAUSE I AM BEING ARRESTED FOR YOU. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!!!'

In a nod to the fourth investigation he is facing, Mr Trump added: 'I NEED ONE MORE INDICTMENT TO ENSURE MY ELECTION.' After arriving at the federal courthouse, Mr Trump was expected to have his mugshot taken and his fingerprints scanned. He was also set to give the US marshals his personal information such as his address and social security number before being led to the judge.

The former president waved as he stepped off his plane at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport to face a judge on federal conspiracy charges

Mr Trump pleaded not guilty to four counts, among them conspiracy to defraud the United States, including his role in the insurrection. He was expected to be bailed with few conditions.

As he left his Trump-branded plane at Reagan National Airport, he looked stony-faced and managed a brief wave to his team. He got into a waiting motorcade and was driven to the court.

Mr Trump appeared in courtroom 22-A, on the second floor. He sat between his lawyers, John Lauro and Todd Blanche, shuffled some papers and kept his hands clasped. Outside, protesters shouted and cheered loudly. Pro-Trump supporters carried flags with slogans such as: 'Trump or death' and 'Trump was right – about everything'.

Among those in the public gallery was Jack Smith, the Special Counsel. The two men exchanged looks as they waited for the judge to enter, and at one point Mr Trump stared at Mr Smith for several seconds. He was also in the court in Florida where Mr Trump was arraigned over mishandling classified documents.

It is the third criminal case Mr Trump is facing despite being the frontrunner for the Republican presidential nomination. But this one is arguably the most controversial and sparked outrage from Mr Trump, who compared it to persecution by Nazi Germany.

Protesters mocked the former U.S. President near the courthouse where he appeared

According to the indictment, Mr Trump and six co-conspirators orchestrated a plot to overturn the results of the election. Special Counsel Mr Smith, who is leading the investigation, has said the plot was 'fuelled by lies' and was an 'unprecedented assault on the seat of American democracy' by preventing a peaceful transfer of power.

Mr Trump's first arraignment was due to be before Magistrate Judge Moxila Upadhyaya. He passed up the option of doing his arraignment via video link and opted to appear in person, as he has done for his other two first appearances in court.

With memories of the insurrection still fresh, Capitol Police Chief Thomas Manger said officers were 'prepared' for any violence. The day before, a 911 call prompted police to evacuate and search a Senate building – but no threat was found.

Mr Trump's lead lawyer John Lauro suggested their defence will be that Mr Trump 'believed' some of the conspiracy theories about election fraud.

But that would put Republicans in the awkward position of saying their likely candidate for the presidency cannot distinguish between fact and conspiracy theories.

Other possible defences touted by Mr Lauro are that Mr Trump's remarks are protected by the First Amendment and that he was following the advice of his lawyers.

Mr Trump's former attorney general Bill Barr slapped down the idea and said that 'free speech does not entitle you to engage in fraudulent conspiracy'.

The E. Barrett Prettyman courthouse has already hosted dozens of trials stemming from the riot on January 6, 2021 – and some of them were being sentenced on the day Mr Trump was arraigned.

The judge who will preside over his trial, Tanya Chutkan, has sentenced numerous January 6 rioters and handed out the harshest punishments of any judge in Washington.

She has clashed with Mr Trump before, and two years ago ruled that his White House records should be given to the committee investigating the riot.

In her ruling, handed down after Mr Trump left office, Judge Chutkan wrote: 'Presidents are not kings, and plaintiff [Trump] is not president.' On Wednesday, she said she had not slept since being assigned to Mr Trump's case.

Meanwhile Mike Pence, Mr Trump's former vice president and opponent for the Republican nomination, ramped up his attacks on his old boss, claiming Mr Trump was 'surrounded by a group of crackpot lawyers that kept telling him what his itching ears want to hear'.

Check in staff revealed that each airline had its own protocols when it came to establishing why passengers are travelling, despite Government assurances from several weeks ago that all would be asked to declare their reasons.

An Emirates official said: ‘We have one flight going out to Dubai each day and do not ask passengers why they are travelling because we are not required to.

'As long as passengers can prove that they have had a negative Covid test from the previous 72 hours then they can travel.’

An official overseeing check in for Air Canada said: ‘We are very strict and make sure that all passengers have a valid reason for travel.

'But I know not all the airlines are like this because the Government has not issued any specific guidelines.’

Passengers at Terminal 2 expressed surprise at how busy it was with many claiming that they had not been asked to declare their reasons for travel.

Majid Khan, who was travelling to Dubai for business said: ‘I had to show my negative Covid test, but nobody asked me why I was travelling to Dubai. I’m very surprised at how many people there are in the airport.

‘Obviously some people still need to travel but it should be for essential reasons only and I don’t understand why the airlines are not checking this.’

Best Western hotel chain savages Boris's quarantine shambles as CEO reveals they haven't heard a single thing from the Government about quarantine hotels Boris Johnson's hotel quarantine plans have been savaged by an industry boss who claimed his firm is yet to hear from the Government on how the policy will actually work. Rob Paterson, the UK chief executive of Best Western Hotels, said his company is being 'kept in the dark' by ministers and 'we simply haven't heard anything'. Mr Paterson blasted the Government for announcing the proposals without a detailed blueprint as he said if he did the same on a major project 'I am not sure I would have a job'. The Prime Minister suggested yesterday that Health Secretary Matt Hancock would set out the details today only for Downing Street to then insist that was a 'misunderstanding'. The PM's Official Spokesman said at lunchtime that 'there are operational aspects of the programme that need to be completed' and details should be set out 'next week'. Mr Paterson suggested questions over cost and insurance are likely to be two of the main reasons why there is a delay. Hotel firms will argue that without knowing the full details of what is required it is impossible for them to assess how much it would cost for them to take part amid fears small passenger numbers would make it financially unviable for many. That is linked to the matter of insurance because companies will want to know how the programme will be underwritten should sites be under-utilised and should they suffer major outbreaks which require them to be put into total lockdown. There had been speculation that hotel quarantine could begin from February 15 but the continued delay in setting out the details means there are growing fears that date will be pushed back. The plans will see travellers returning to the UK from 'red list' countries - those where coronavirus variants have been discovered or where case numbers have rocketed - forced to pay to self-isolate in a Government-approved hotel for 10 days. The criticism of the roll-out of the policy came amid speculation that Spain could be added to the 'red list' after it recorded its first variant case last week and because of its close proximity to Portugal which is already banned.

Alex, who was travelling to Dubai to organise an art exhibition revealed that he would be staying in the country for three months.

He said: ‘I’ve got a letter from my work stating the reason for travel but haven’t been asked for it. The queue for check in was quite long because Emirates airline had some kind of systems failure.

‘This is the first time that I’m travelling since the pandemic and am a little nervous and was expecting to be questioned a lot more about why I’m going to Dubai. There just seems to be a lot of confusion over the enforcement of the rules.’

Simon Foster who was travelling to Canada for what he described as ‘an important family visit’ said: ‘I was asked by the airline why I was travelling, which is the right thing to do and had documentation to prove it.

‘I was also asked for proof of my negative Covid test. Canada seems to be very strict about who it’s letting in and why, which is not the case with Britain. There need to be more checks here.’

Ella Myers, who was travelling to her home in Paris said: ‘I’ve been on a business trip to London and compared to France, the lockdown is not being imposed very strictly here.

‘I’ve got a letter from my company stating that I’ve been on a work trip, but nobody checked, which is a bit poor.’

Boris Johnson facing mounting Tory backlash over plans to ease lockdown Tory anger is mounting over 'goalpost shifting' on lockdown today as ministers and scientists suggested all over-50s should get vaccines before any 'significant' easing. Pressure is growing on Boris Johnson to commit to a major relaxation of the draconian measures within weeks, after the UK's rollout of jabs hit the milestone of 10million people covered. But there is alarm that the bar for allowing the economy to get back up and running is being lifted, with dire warnings about the threat of mutant coronavirus added to concerns about the strain on the NHS. Vaccines minister Nadhim Zahawi appeared to indicate this morning that the government is looking at the top nine risk categories - around 32million people - as the trigger point for a widespread downgrading of measures. So far the PM has only said that he will unveil a route map out of lockdown on February 22, after the first four most vulnerable groups have been covered. Mr Zahawi refused to give a date for when the nine categories in phase one of the rollout will be complete. Meanwhile, SAGE member Professor Andrew Hayward gave a similar message as he said there could be a 'significant return to normality' after all over-50s are vaccinated. 'Once the most vulnerable people, particularly those over 50 and those with chronic illnesses, are vaccinated then yes I think we can see a significant return to normality,' he said. However, Prof Hayward said he still hoped the UK will be 'more or less back to normal for the summer'. There were claims today that Chancellor Rishi Sunak is again leading calls within Cabinet for lockdown to be eased as early as possible - in contrast to the more cautious tone adopted by Mr Johnson recently.

International travel is already prohibited under UK lockdown rules unless it is essential.

Ministers hope the hotel quarantine plans will help protect against importing Covid-19 variants which could threaten the nation's vaccination drive.

But the roll-out has been chaotic with the Government still unable to say when the hotels will be up and running.

Mr Paterson was asked during an interview on BBC Radio 4's Today programme this morning if ministers had told his company what they want.

He replied: 'No, not at all. We got the understanding that quarantine hotels was something that was going to be considered in the UK quite some time ago now and we are yet to understand exactly what the protocols are required of the hotels.

'We have set out a set of protocols, we have shared that information, or suggested protocols, and we have offered our support and we are yet to hear anything.'

Asked if the Government had given any indication about how many travellers hotels could be asked to accommodate, Mr Paterson said: 'No. I think in any normal company if you went out and announced a programme nationally and you hadn't thought about how you were going to plan that and you hadn't spoken to the people involved, I am not sure I would have a job if I did that in my company.

'To this day it seems logical to me that you would sit down with the airlines, the airport operators and the hotel operators and thrash this out on a Zoom call or whatever it might be.

'To this day we simply haven't heard anything despite multiple offers.

'We have connections in Singapore and Australia and New Zealand who are doing this that we could learn from and easily get on the phone and offer their support and we are just a bit surprised that we just haven't heard anything.'

Mr Paterson said his company had not been provided by the Government with anything 'other than very broad information' on the policy and that 'we haven't had any discussions at all'.

He added: 'We have offered that help. We have got a lot of experience with the quarantine or managing Covid positive environments through the project we did with the NHS.

'As I say, we have all these contacts in other countries that have already rolled this out for some time, they could offer some really valuable support and we are just simply kept in the dark.'

Mr Paterson said that questions over the cost of the policy and insurance are likely to be two of the main issues holding up the roll-out.

Most people believe Brexit has helped UK vaccine drive Most Britons believe Brexit has helped the UK's vaccine drive - as the EU struggles with a chaotic rollout and supply shortages. A poll for MailOnline shows the contrast between the rapid progress in Britain and the problems in the bloc has not been lost on the public. Some 35 per cent said leaving the EU had been useful for the massive national effort, compared to 20 per cent who thought it had been a hindrance. Around a quarter said they thought it had a neutral effect, and 19 per cent said they were not sure, according to the research by Redfield & Wilton Strategies. While the UK hit the milestone of 10million people given jabs yesterday, the EU's programme has descended into a shambles with the central regulator far slower to sign off jabs and the bloc moving too late to secure supplies. The fallout on the continent triggered threats from Ursula von der Leyen to bar exports to the UK and impose a hard border with Northern Ireland, which was later humiliatingly dropped. Advertisement

On the issue of money and costs, he said: 'I think that is one of the challenges because if you take a hotel that is currently closed and they open that hotel, there is big expense to open that hotel so a hotelier is only going to open that hotel if there is a genuine business need.

'Now, if they open that big hotel at the airport or wherever it might be and five people turn up to pay because there is no block booking here, we understand customers are going to pay, then they're going to be losing more than they are losing now when it is closed.

'We need some assurance of what demand levels are going to be and then once they turn up, to understand the pricing we need to understand what security protocols are needed.

'We have cleaning protocols and we have suggested security protocols and etc but we are just not sure exactly what that means.

'In Australia they have perimeters and all sorts of different things that we would need to factor into our pricing to understand.'

Mr Paterson said insurance is also a hurdle to be overcome so that hotels know they are covered financially should the circumstances arise where they have to go into total lockdown because of a large-scale outbreak.

'That is one of the big, big challenges in this and we have had some experience with insurance,' he said.

'Insurers are a bit nervous about this and that is a real question that we want to try to understand from Government what the requirements are and who would underwrite that.'

Ministers are expected to meet today to discuss whether the existing 'red list', which is currently made up of 33 countries, needs to be expanded.

The Government is facing growing calls from Labour and some Tory MPs to introduce a blanket hotel quarantine requirement for all UK arrivals.

Nick Thomas-Symonds, the shadow home secretary, said: 'The Government's plans around quarantine are in disarray.

'Not only do they fail to go far enough - leaving open the door to potential vaccine resistant strains - they can't even implement the half-baked plans that have been announced.

Boris Johnson under pressure to speed up reopening of schools Boris Johnson was coming under increasing pressure to speed up the reopening of English schools today as Wales confirmed its intention to restart some primary classes after the February half term. Welsh health minister Vaughan Gething confirmed that some of the youngest age groups would go back to school from February 22 under a similar plan to that underway in Scotland. In contrast, English schools are not due to reopen until March 8, and the Prime Minister last night was resisting mounting pressure to accelerate. Tory MPs called for the move after new research showed that as well as saving lives, the Oxford vaccine will cut transmission of the virus by two-thirds. There was also concern that with English pupils risk falling further behind their counterparts. Mr Gething told Times Radio that the 'first priority' for the Welsh Government is to start a return to face-to-face teaching in some schools, despite coronavirus cases being 'quite high'. 'We've got to go in small steps and schools are the first priority and hopefully, straight after the half-term break, we'll be able to see our youngest children return to face-to-face learning in primary schools,' he said.

'It's now over six weeks since the South African strain was discovered and yet there is almost no reliable quarantine system in place. Conservative incompetence is putting people at risk.'

Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said he believes hotel quarantine should apply to every international arrival, with exemptions only for people supplying medicines or food.

He said: 'We're calling for quarantine for everybody who arrives in the UK from any country.

'There will have to be exceptions for medicines and foods – there always is – but for everybody else that is not within those exceptions, a full quarantine.

'And the reason for that is because, in the first wave, 0.1 per cent of cases came from China where we had restrictions, 62 per cent came from France and from Spain where we didn't have restrictions.

'There is every reason to think the variant will behave in the same way and that's why we're saying to Government, ""we're in a race now, virus against vaccination, let's secure our borders while we carry out the vaccination process"".'

Mr Johnson warned yesterday that Britain cannot shut its borders completely to prevent mutant coronavirus strains getting into the country as he denied ignoring SAGE advice on the issue.

The PM insisted closing off the country altogether was 'not practical'.

Yvette Cooper, the Labour chairman of the Home Affairs Select Committee, said it is 'troubling' that the Government 'don't seem to be talking to some of the major hotel chains already'.

She said: 'We've always been warned about both second waves and new variants; the work should have been done a long time ago.

'The problem is, of course, as long as we're waiting, not just for this system but for stronger measures, we know that the system isn't working at the moment.

'We can see that because the South Africa variant is spreading across the country, that's the evidence that too many cases are getting into the country, then spreading in the country.'

Vaccines Minister Nadhim Zahawi said this morning quarantine hotels are 'part of a much bigger plan'.

'If you come to the UK, already you have to quarantine for 10 days, you have to have a test within three days before travel, you have to fill in a passenger locator form… we already have a robust border policy,' he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.

Challenged over how 'robust' measures actually are, he said: 'You have to have a pre-departure test before you arrive – people have to have that or they will be turned away.

'Mutiny' at Heathrow: Security step in as furious passengers 'leap over' malfunctioning passport barriers Heathrow staff faced a 'mutiny' yesterday with security staff stepping in to stop furious passengers 'leaping over' malfunctioning passport barriers, a witness has claimed. The chaos erupted after some of the machines stopped working, with passengers saying they were forced to queue for hours following an in-direct flight from Dubai. Adnan Raza, 34 from Birmingham, said the malfunctioning machines at the London airport prompted chaos the 'mutiny' from passengers. He said some tried to climb over barriers before they were tackled and detained by Border Force officers. The Home Office confirmed two people 'attempted to evade being checked' but were 'immediately' stopped by officials. A ban on direct flights from Dubai to the UK came into force last week, with passengers rushing back to Britain before the rules kicked in. Describing the Heathrow chaos, Mr Raza told the Mirror: 'People get fed up, it's what happens when you push people too far. 'They had been waiting in the queue for ages. Processing those queues takes forever.' The businessman is now self-isolating at home but said he waited almost two hours on touching down at Heathrow before he could leave. He slammed the situation at Heathrow as a 'shambles' and said it was far worse than what he'd seen in Dubai and Frankfurt. Mr Raza also said that customs officers were only interested in checking his Covid PCR test was negative and didn't even scan his passenger locator form. This was disputed by a Border Force spokesman. Mr Raza continued: 'There's absolutely no social distancing, it's ridiculous. Behind me the machines stopped working and there was a bit of a mutiny, people started jumping over the barriers of the automated machines. There was a melee...security pacified the situation.' Mr Raza was in Dubai for business meetings with two others from the UK. Advertisement

'When you arrive, you have to quarantine, even without the hotel quarantine operation yet in place, so the border policy, I think, with the passenger locator forms, where greater enforcement is taking place now than ever before, is robust.'

Mr Zahawi said Mr Hancock will soon set out further details on the policy.

He told ITV's Good Morning Britain programme: 'Next week the Secretary of State for Health will be setting out the operational elements of this policy.

'We will absolutely be setting out how the quarantine hotels will work next week.'

Asked whether he had been frustrated by the delay in implementing the tighter border restrictions, Mr Zahawi replied: 'No, because it is one part of a greater piece.'

He accused the British government of 'political grandstanding' with the snap travel ban to Dubai, following criticism of influencers travelling there.

What are the rules on travel from the UAE? Why is the UAE being added to the travel ban? It follows evidence that the more infectious South African strain of Covid-19 had been detected in the UAE. What does this mean? No passenger flights from Dubai or Abu Dhabi may arrive in the UK. Non-UK residents are banned from entering if in the UAE within ten days. Have all flights been cancelled? No. Emirates and Etihad Airways said all UK passenger flights from the UAE were suspended, although British Airways told passengers that some were still running. Are there exemptions? Yes. British, Irish and third country nationals with residence rights in the UK are allowed to return from the UAE but they will need to travel via a third country. Are there many Britons in Dubai? Up to 10,000 UK residents are thought to be in the UAE Will arrivals from the UAE have to quarantine in hotels? Not yet. Officials are said to be considering this from the week beginning February 8. For now, UK residents must self-isolate at home with all members of their household for ten days if returning from the UAE. Can you circumvent the rules? Non-UK residents are banned from entering Britain if they have been in the UAE within ten days. So a non-UK resident in Dubai could travel to a country not on the banned list, stay there for ten days, then enter Britain. How many countries are now on the banned list? The UAE joined the existing red list of 30 countries – mainly in South America and southern Africa – along with Rwanda and Burundi in central Africa. Will this affect those travelling through Dubai? Yes. The ban could have a much wider impact for British travellers returning from further afield because Abu Dhabi and Dubai are major international transit hubs. Advertisement

'Every airport across the UK has a responsibility to comply with social distancing and Covid compliant measures on site.'

A Heathrow spokesperson said: 'Long queues at the border should not be a surprise to the Home Office.

'We warned the Home Secretary last year that Border Force was consistently failing to meet its 45-minute queue standard, and it's clear from the last week that adequate steps have not been taken to address these.

'It is not reasonable, not should it be necessary, for any airport to have space to hold arriving passengers for up to three hours.

'The Home Office needs to get to grips with this issue.'

Dubai, which is home to some 240,000 British expats and is a major tourist destination for UK travellers, is likely to face a major economic hit from the travel ban.

Despite the restrictions, models, social media influencers and reality TV stars have defiantly stayed at the poolside in Dubai and Abu Dhabi after thousands of other British travellers raced home to beat the restrictions.

The likes of Mia Sully from Absolutely Ascot and Love Island stars Joseph Garratt and Anton Danyluk were pictured on Instagram enjoying life in the sunshine last week.

This is despite the UK Government adding the United Arab Emirates to the so-called red list of countries from where travel to Britain is prohibited during the coronavirus pandemic.

Others including Only Fans model Honey Evans from Leeds said they would stay out in Dubai despite the ban. She tweeted: 'Flights from Dubai to the UK are banned. Guess I have no choice but to stay out here. Shame.' Following a backlash, Ms Evans later added: 'So many people giving me s*** for being in Dubai.'

Due to border closures caused by Covid-19, Dubai to London was the world's busiest international route in January with 190,365 scheduled seats this month. In normal times the busiest route to and from London is New York City.

Many Britons are staying out in Dubai because they know they will only have to quarantine at home for ten days upon their return - and a rule forcing them to stay in a hotel will not come in until February 8 at the earliest.

But some said they had just managed to get home just before the ban on direct inbound passenger flights from the UAE to Britain came into effect last week.

Emirates and Etihad Airways said all UK passenger flights from the UAE have been suspended, although British Airways told passengers that some were still running.

Other countries which have banned flights from the UAE include Denmark, which had concerns over the reliability of Covid-19 tests at some private clinics in Dubai - although the UAE has since reassured Denmark about this.

Around 10,000 UK citizens were thought to currently be in the Gulf state, including a host of social media names who flocked to Dubai before Britain's third lockdown, before the travel ban was put in place.

He confirmed that the United Arab Emirates, which includes the skyscraper-heavy city-state, had been added to the UK Government's red list along with Burundi and Rwanda.

A Department for Transport spokesman said: 'The decision to ban travel from these destinations follows the discovery of a new coronavirus variant first identified in South Africa, that may have spread to other countries, including the United Arab Emirates, Burundi and Rwanda.

'Any exemptions usually in place will not apply, including for business travel.

'British nationals currently in the UAE should make use of the commercial options available if they wish to return to the UK. Indirect commercial routes that will enable British and Irish nationals and residents to return to the UK continue to operate.'

The move came amid a furious Tory row over Home Secretary Priti Patel's attack on leisure travel and social media influencers sunning themselves overseas during lockdown.

MPs and airlines attacked her 'shambolic' holiday ban announcement amid fears it will leave airport staff facing the full anger of travellers.

They accused the Home Secretary of launching a broadside at Instagram influencers and holidaymakers after being 'humiliated' over her attempts to close the UK border completely to foreign arrivals.

She read the riot act to would-be travellers last, warning that people on fake work jaunts and social media attention-seekers heading for sunny destinations will be turned away from airports.

Influencers boasting of sunshine foreign breaks amid the global pandemic are now facing a furious public backlash after they were slammed by the Home Secretary.

As they shared photos from sun loungers, lockdown had appeared not to apply to so-called influencers and models who 'used loop-holes' to jet off the sunnier climes under the guise of work.

But foreign travel - apart from some exceptions - has been illegal since the lockdown law was passed on January 5.

There was also confusion over what would constitute an acceptable journey abroad and who would police the policy.

Meanwhile ministers are facing demands to add more countries to the UK's 'red list' amid growing fears over the threat of importing mutant coronavirus strains.

The government moved to toughen the border regime last week, announcing that the ban on travellers from more than 30 'hotspot' countries will be expanded so returning Britons and the few other exempt individuals will have to go into 'quarantine hotels' at their own expense for 10 days.

But the plan has been the subject of an extraordinary Cabinet tussle, with Priti Patel and Matt Hancock among those pushing for even tougher action.

And the rules forcing all arrivals from the 'red list' countries - including South Africa, much of South America and Portugal - to isolate in hotels at their own expense are still thought to be weeks from implementation.

Officials have admitted there are serious logistical issues to the policy, including setting up enough accommodation for the arrivals and making sure it can be guarded.

The delay comes amid rising fears that the South African variant is already loose in the UK, and other more potent mutant strains could lessen the effectiveness of the vaccine drive. Senior Tories have joined Labour in calling for the countries covered by the restrictions to be widened, while Nicola Sturgeon turned up the heat today by announcing Scotland will unilaterally force all arrivals to quarantine. In a direct attack on the Prime Minister's strategy, the First Minister said it would not work and called on him to mirror her approach, telling MSPs at Holyrood: 'The firm view of the Scottish Government is that in order to minimise the risk of new strains coming into the country, managed quarantine must be much more comprehensive.' The 'red list' is usually reviewed on Thursdays, with the United Arab Emirates having been added last week, and the government has said it will look at expanding the roster further. Advertisement

Senior Tories have joined Labour in calling for the countries covered by the restrictions to be widened, while Nicola Sturgeon turned up the heat today by announcing Scotland will unilaterally force all arrivals to quarantine.

In a direct attack on the Prime Minister's strategy, the First Minister said it would not work and called on him to mirror her approach, telling MSPs at Holyrood: 'The firm view of the Scottish Government is that in order to minimise the risk of new strains coming into the country, managed quarantine must be much more comprehensive.'

The 'red list' is usually reviewed on Thursdays, with the United Arab Emirates having been added last week, and the government has said it will look at expanding the roster further.

Meanwhile, the PM is facing accusations that he ignored advice from SAGE weeks ago that the borders should be closed.

A paper from the scientific group on January 21 said full closure of the borders was the only way to stop variants spreading.

However, No10 has angrily denied the idea, saying SAGE specifically said the government should not 'rely' on travel bans and there was no 'zero risk' option available.

The PM's aides said the paper called for an 'effective policy regime including testing and or quarantine/isolation for travellers'. 'This is the policy step we took,' one No10 source said.

Prof Calum Semple, a member of SAGE, admitted this morning that Britain was a 'complex transit country' and a full border closure was not practical as it would stop food imports.

But he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: 'In general I do support restricting movement, particularly of people in this time.'

The row comes as a frantic bid to contain the South African strain begins, with specialist teams going door to door to test 80,000 people in areas where the more contagious variant is feared to be spreading.

Scientists are worried the South African strain may be able to evade vaccines and stressed that anyone who suspects they could be infected should self-isolate immediately.

Universities minister Michelle Donelan today played down concerns about how long it was taking to introduce the quarantine rules.

'I don't think there's a delay. There wasn't a timeframe set originally as to when we would announce this,' she said in a round of interviews.

'We announced the intention of this last week in conjunction with other initiatives that we're doing, including banning travel from other countries, and the details will be announced.

'It is a logistical effort as well, as you will appreciate, and so it all needs to be laid out properly and the health secretary will be doing that.'

The PM's spokesman said: 'Sage did not actually advise the Government to completely close borders or call for a blanket quarantine on travels.

'They don't put forward recommendations. Their modelling showed a combination of specific policy options, including pre-departure testing and isolation, are effective in mitigating the public health risk.'

But former health secretary Jeremy Hunt was among those urging the government to step up its response.

'I think we should have done this much earlier, but I am pleased that we are doing something,' he told Sky News.

'I think it is absolutely right that we are bringing in hotel quarantine.

'The trouble with just doing it for a few countries is that someone coming to the UK from Brazil could go via numerous other countries.

'It is very difficult if you restrict it to a small number of countries. So we might need to expand that list significantly as we go forward.'",Confusion at Heathrow over some airlines asking for reasons for travelling while others are not,1

The video of a civilian being gunned down in the street has been condemned by a UN special envoy, who also decried separate footage of a medical crew being savagely beaten by police as the generals try to stamp out dissent.

The shooting video shows the protester being marched away from a building by riot police before falling to the ground after the gunshot rings out.

After the person briefly raises their head, two of the troops drag them down the street by the arms as security forces take control of the area.

'A protester was taken away by police and they shot him from very near, maybe only one metre. He didn't resist his arrest, and it seems that he died on the street,' said the UN's Myanmar envoy Christine Schraner Burgener.

More than 50 civilians have been killed since the military's February 1 coup, including 38 who died on the bloodiest day of clashes on Wednesday.

At least five children have been reportedly killed since the protests began, UNICEF said, with four severely wounded and 500 arbitrarily detained.

Digital rights group Myanmar ICT for Development says it has found more than 800 pro-military videos that threatened protesters with further violence.

One video shows a man in army fatigues aiming an assault rifle at the camera and addressing protesters: 'I will shoot in your f***ing faces... and I'm using real bullets.'

'I am going to patrol the whole city tonight and I will shoot whoever I see... If you want to become a martyr, I will fulfil your wish', he says.

TikTok vowed to 'promptly remove all content that incites violence or spreads misinformation' while Facebook has banned all pages linked to Myanmar's army.

Horrific footage has emerged of three medics being surrounded by at least a dozen police officers who were kicking and punching them and even hitting them with their guns as they tried to cower away from the violence

Police were also filmed on Wednesday beating a volunteer ambulance crew in Myanmar's largest city and commercial hub of Yangon.

CCTV footage showed armed police stopping an ambulance at gunpoint and forcing three medics out before attacking them.

Six cops can be seen smashing the medics over the head with rifle butts, beating them with truncheons, kicking them in the head and blasting out the windows of their ambulance with shotguns.

Meanwhile Myanmar's military sent fighter jets on a menacing low pass over the country's second-largest city today in a show of force to accompany the violence.

The five low-flying warplanes buzzed over Mandalay in formation as the generals try to stamp out dissent more than a month since seizing power in the February 1 coup.

And more footage detailed how officers opened fire on crowds of demonstrators in cities around the country without warning, leaving the streets covered in blood.

One piece of footage from Monywa shows how officers were ordered to drag away the body of one protester who had been fatally shot, while graphic video from Myingyan showed a 14-year-old boy who was shot in the head.

The US called the images appalling, the UN human rights chief said it was time to 'end the military's stranglehold over democracy in Myanmar,' and the world body's independent expert on human rights in the country urged the Security Council to watch the videos before meeting Friday to discuss the crisis.

'I saw today very disturbing video clips,' said UN envoy to Myanmar Christine Schraner Burgener told reporters on Thursday.

'One was police beating a volunteer medical crew,' Burgener said. 'They were not armed.

'Another video clip showed a protester was taken away by police and they shot him from very near, maybe only one meter. He didn't resist to his arrest, and it seems that he died on the street.'

Wednesday marked the bloodiest day yet in Myanmar after military leaders seized power, undoing the country's years-long experiment with democracy and drawing tens of thousands of protesters on to the streets.

'Everything will be OK': Tears for protester called 'Angel' who was shot in the head A 19-year-old protester called Kyal Sin - also known as Angel - was shot in the head on the streets of Mandalay after joining the anti-coup protests on Wednesday. She was wearing a T-shirt that read: 'Everything will be OK', a slogan which has since been taken up by her allies and mourners. Angel was a taekwondo expert as well as a dancer at Mandalay's DA-Star Dance Club, posting videos of her latest moves on Facebook. Kyal Sin, also known as Angel Last year she had proudly voted for the first time in the country's tentative democracy. But she joined the protests after the election result was overturned by the generals' coup on February 1. After initially taking to the streets waving the flag of Aung San Suu Kyi's pro-democracy movement, she kept going even as protests grew more dangerous and as the junta deployed combat troops with assault rifles alongside police. Despite her shirt, she had known it might not be OK - leaving details of her blood group, a contact number and a request to donate her body in the event of her death. She had been on the frontline of the barricades in Mandalay where a fellow protester said she had bravely kicked open a water pipe so that others could wash tear gas from their eyes. Before the police assault, Angel can be heard on video shouting, 'We won't run' and 'blood must not be shed'. 'When the police opened fire she told me 'Sit! Sit! Bullets will hit you. You look like you're on a stage',' recalled Myat Thu, 23. 'She cared for and protected others as a comrade. 'She was a happy girl, she loved her family and her father loved her so much too,' said Myat Thu, who is now in hiding. 'We are not in a war. There is no reason to use live bullets on people. If they are human, they will not do it.' Advertisement

As well as the 14-year-old boy killed in Myingyan, another 17-year-old was shot dead elsewhere in the country, Save The Children said.

Nineteen-year-old Kyal Sin, also known as 'Angel', was also killed after being shot in the neck in Mandalay, local media reported.

She was pictured wearing a t-shirt saying 'everything will be OK' just moments before being killed. Thousands gathered today at her funeral in Mandalay.

Deaths also occurred in the country's largest city of Yangon and the northern mining town of Hpakant.

Witnesses said police gave no warnings to protesters - who have been on the streets almost every day since the military seized power - before opening fire with live ammunition.

Dozens more were wounded by rubber bullets and slingshots fired by officers, according to local doctors.

As part of the crackdown, security forces have also arrested around 1,200 people, including journalists who are facing charges under security laws, according to UN envoy Schraner Burgener.

More than 500 children are estimated to be among those arbitrarily detained, UNICEF said Thursday.

The numbers of demonstrators flooding the streets of cities across the country has remained high even as security forces have repeatedly fired tear gas, rubber bullets and live rounds to disperse the crowds, and arrested protesters en masse.

Myanmar has been in chaos since February 1 when the military launched a coup and detained civilian leader Aung San Suu Kyi, ending the country's decade-long experiment with democracy and sparking daily mass protests.

Despite the violence they have endured, demonstrators returned to the streets on Thursday to mourn those who were killed.

International pressure is mounting - Western powers have repeatedly hit the generals with sanctions - and Britain has called for a United Nations meeting on Friday.

But the junta has ignored the global condemnation, responding to the uprising with escalating brutality.

'Only today, 38 people died,' UN envoy to Myanmar Christine Schraner Burgener told reporters on Wednesday, adding that more than 50 people have died in total since the military takeover, with many more wounded.

'Today was the bloodiest day since the coup happened,' she added, without providing any further details, including a breakdown of the deaths.

Burgener called for the UN to take 'very strong measures' against the generals, adding that in her conversations with them, they had dismissed the threat of sanctions.

'I will keep going on, we will not give up,' she said.

Burgener added that she receives some 2,000 messages per day from people inside Myanmar, many 'who are really desperate to see action from the international community.'

British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said on Thursday he was horrified by the recent violence in Myanmar and called for a restoration of democracy.

'I'm horrified by the escalation of violence in Myanmar and the killing of pro-democracy protesters,' Johnson said on Twitter.

'We stand with the people of Myanmar in calling for an immediate end to military repression, the release of Aung San Suu Kyi and others, and the restoration of democracy,' said Johnson.

British foreign minister Dominic Raab said the UK would be convening the United Nations Security Council to discuss the issue on Friday.

'Terrible scenes in Myanmar. Targeting your own people with lethal force for simply exercising their right to peaceful protest is unacceptable,' Raab said on Twitter on Thursday.

'The ongoing violence and the intimidation must end. The UK & partners will be convening @UN Security Council on Friday.

The violence left the United States 'appalled and revulsed,' State Department spokesman Ned Price said, telling reporters: 'We call on all countries to speak with one voice to condemn the brutal violence by the Burmese military against its own people.'

He singled out China, a frequent US adversary that Myanmar's military has historically considered its main ally.

'China does have influence in the region. It does have influence with the military junta. We have called upon the Chinese to use that influence in a constructive way, in a way that advances the interests of the people of Burma,' Price said, using another name for Myanmar.

And he said the United States, which has imposed sanctions on junta leaders, was looking at further actions.

Earlier, AFP recorded at least 17 deaths across Myanmar on Wednesday, with Monywa in the central Sagaing region registering at least seven, according to a doctor.

Medics also said they saw two other individuals being dragged away by security forces but could not confirm if they had died.

In Yangon protesters used makeshift tyre and barbed wire barricades to block major roads.

At least six demonstrators died in Yangon, according to a rescue worker and local journalist.

In downtown Pansodan Road, near the famed Sule pagoda intersection, protesters pasted print-outs of junta leader Min Aung Hlaing's face on the ground - a tactic aimed at slowing down security forces who will avoid standing on the portraits.

In San Chaung township, which has been the site of intense clashes in recent days, tear gas and fire extinguisher clouds filled the streets as riot police confronted protesters.

In Mandalay, Myanmar's second-largest city, two demonstrators were killed, a doctor confirmed to AFP, adding that one of the victims aged 19 - now revealed to be Angel - was shot in the head.

Another 19-year-old protester died after being shot in Salin.

'They shouldn't have used such lethal force against the peaceful protesters,' said his friend Min Pyae Phyo, through tears. 'I won't forget and forgive them the rest of my life.'

A protest in the central city of Myingyan also turned deadly, as security forces confronted protesters in hard hats crouching behind red home-made shields emblazoned with the three-finger salute - a symbol of resistance for the anti-coup movement.

'They fired tear gas, rubber bullets, and live rounds,' a volunteer medic on the scene told AFP, adding that at least 10 people were injured.

Thet Thet Swe, from Myingyan rescue clinic, confirmed a young man was shot in the head and died. Several medics confirmed this.

'Zin Ko Ko Zaw, a 20-year-old was shot dead on the spot and my team treated 17 injured people,' a second rescue team member told AFP.

There were also chaotic scenes at North Okkalapa - a civil society health clinic confirmed 19 injured people had arrived for medical treatment.

'Some got hit with rubber bullets, some fell down and some were beaten. We had to transfer one man to hospital for a operation because a rubber bullet hit his head. We do not have a surgeon here,' an official told AFP.

Local media in northern Kachin state also reported similar scenes of violence.

In Dawei, one gunshot victim from Sunday - when 18 people were killed across the country - was cremated on Wednesday.

Mourners held floral wreaths and portraits of Lwin Lwin Oo, 33, as coffin bearers were flanked by hundreds chanting: 'We are united... Democracy is our cause.'

UNICEF condemned the reported killings of at least five children since Wednesday, as well as the wounding of four others.

'In addition to those killed or seriously wounded, many children are being exposed to harm from tear gas and stun grenades, and are witnessing horrific scenes of violence, in some cases directed against parents or family members,' UNICEF said in a statement Thursday.

The intensifying standoff is unfortunately familiar in a country with a long history of peaceful resistance to military rule - and brutal crackdowns. The coup reversed years of slow progress toward democracy in the Southeast Asian nation after five decades of military rule.

Wednesday's violence came after the foreign ministers of Southeast Asian nations - including Myanmar's junta representative Wunna Maung Lwin - discussed the crisis at a virtual meeting.

After the talks Indonesia's Retno Marsudi expressed frustration over the junta's lack of cooperation, and Singapore condemned the use of lethal force.

The violence on Wednesday also came on the heels of news that six Myanmar journalists would be charged under a law prohibiting 'causing fear, spreading false news, or agitating directly or indirectly a government employee', according to their lawyer Tin Zar Oo.

Among them is Associated Press photographer Thein Zaw, who was arrested Saturday as he covered an anti-coup demonstration in Yangon. Video emerged on Wednesday of him being held in a chokehold by police as he was handcuffed.

The other five are from Myanmar Now, Myanmar Photo Agency, 7Day News, Zee Kwet Online News and a freelancer. They face up to three years in jail.

The junta amended the legislation last month, increasing the maximum sentence from two years to three years in jail.

The United States called for their release and was 'forcefully making clear' that their detention was 'unacceptable,' Price said.

Burgener said that the generals had told her they would hold elections in 'one year.'

But she also said she had not been able to speak directly with the leaders since February 15, communicating only in writing since then.

She said she sent a 'long letter' directly to the army's number two Soe Win on Sunday but had not yet heard back, though she did receive information from the army daily.

And she said she had not yet been granted permission to visit the country.

According to the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners (AAPP) monitoring group, more than 1,200 people have been arrested since the coup, with about 900 still behind bars or facing charges.

But the real number is likely far higher - state-run media reported more than 1,300 people were arrested on Sunday alone.

State-broadcaster MRTV said Tuesday 511 detainees had been released in Yangon.

Pope Francis on Wednesday urged Myanmar's military authorities to prioritise dialogue over repression.

'We are still getting sad news from Myanmar of bloody clashes with losses of human lives,' Francis said during his weekly audience.

'I would like to draw the attention of the involved authorities so that dialogue may prevail over repression and harmony over discord,' the 84-year-old Catholic leader said.

The international community should 'work so that the aspirations of the people of Myanmar are not stifled by violence', Francis said.

Donald Trump has made history by becoming the first president to pose for a mugshot after his arrest for trying to overturn the 2020 election results in Georgia

Donald Trump has been booked into Fulton County jail in Atlanta on charges of attempting to overthrow Georgia's 2020 election, declaring on the tarmac after his arrest that it was 'a very sad day for America.'

He described the hisotric moment as 'a travesty of justice' and added: 'We did nothing wrong, I did nothing wrong.'

'This is election interference. So I want to thank you for being here. We did nothing wrong,' Trump said. 'We had every right, every single right, to challenge an election we think was dishonest.'

Inside the jail, Trump's vital details - white male, 6-feet 3-inches tall, and a weight of 215 pounds - were recorded, and his fingerprints and mugshot were taken. The mugshot was the first of a former president and immediately became one of the most famous pictures of all time.

The bond payment was made - 10 percent of $200,000 - and the 77-year-old was released.

At 7:55pm, inmate number P01135809 left the jail to return to Atlanta airport, and flew back to New Jersey.

Lara Trump, the billionaire businessman's daughter-in-law, said that it was 'absurd' that he had his mugshot and fingerprints taken.

'He's not a flight risk, he's one of the most recognizable men in the world,' she told Fox News.

'We've seen what infiltrating the legal system with politics can do. It is no longer a republic: it becomes an authoritarian state.'

Trump and the other 18 defendants will be arraigned in several weeks time. The defendants in the case - all facing RICO and other counts related to efforts to allegedly overturn the 2020 presidential elections in Georgia - had until Friday to turn themselves in.

Dozens of supporters lined the streets as he arrived, many having been there in Georgia's 95-degree heat since 9am to show support.

Georgia GOP Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene made an appearance and was immediately swarmed by media and Trump supporters.

She railed against the weaponization of the law and prattled off her usual defenses of Trump. She also said she thought Vivek Ramaswami had the best performance in the GOP debate on Wednesday night.

'The rest of them sounded like George Bush Republicans.'

As she made the rounds at the media tents giving interviews, Greene was hounded by far-right activist Laura Loomer and her acolytes - 'When are you going to get Kevin McCarthy to endorse President Trump?' they demanded.

'I've never seen anyone attacked like him. I don't know how he stands it,' said another Trump supporter, Molly Sturgeon, of White, Georgia.

She told DailyMail.com: 'I just want to support him because if someone was unjustly accusing me of something I would want someone out here.

'He probably won't see me here, but maybe he'll see the reports or the photos.'

Sturgeon, wearing a blue 'Women for Trump' shirt and a red MAGA hat, said she was saddened by what she saw as the lack of outrage at the charges.

'The country is so complacent the people are so apathetic to politics, they just feel so defeated,' she said.

'So many people I talk to are, like, I don't even care about politics, it's all corruption.

'But everyone can do something, and me being here isn't much, but if there's one person I encourage or talk to, that's helpful.'

Peppered amongst the supporters of Trump were protesters against him.

One Atlanta local, Kimberly Wallace, told DailyMail.com she came to support Georgia district attorney Fani Willis, who Trump claimed 'is getting killed' for indicting him.

'I want to show that people are here to support her, because I think people take for granted that common sense is always going to prevail,' she said.

'Obviously the system is working since they were all indicted, but you still have to show support.'

She said that the people who took to the streets to protest for Black Lives Matter needed to get back out to show 'we are still in solidarity for democracy.'

And she warned Trump's co-defendants that they would be the ones to suffer the worst consequences.

'I'm old school - from New Jersey,' said Wallace.

'When RICO laws were put in place for drug dealers, guess what? The big guy never got the most time. The little people that rally behind him, watch yourself, people. He's gonna let you go under the bus.'

Characters from all walks of life made a showing outside the courthouse on Thursday.

There were Women for Trump, Latinos for Trump and Blacks for Trump - plus another, new, group - the RAT club.

'That's Republicans Against Trump,' said Domenic Santana, dressed in a prison costume with two men dressed as rats walking alongside him.

'He's a rat. He got away with it in New York,' Santana told DailyMail.com, speaking in an accent similar to New Yorker Trump's.

'I know a rat when I see one because I grew up in New York, so I'm from the school of rats.'

The self-proclaimed Republican said he thought Nikki Haley had the best performance in Wednesday night's debate.

'I think this was the spark that could ignite her.'

He then held up a packet of Kool-Aid.

'Donald Trump is the next Jim Jones,' he said, referring to the cult leader who claimed himself to be a messiah.

'He's giving people Kool-Aid! Don't drink the Kool-Aid, America!'

Santana predicted Trump would not do any jail time for his crimes.

'At the end of the day, he'll get a slap on the wrist. They're gonna give him house arrest. Let's hope it's not the White House,' he said.

'He has the Supreme Court, he's gonna appeal.'

Earlier on Thursday, Trump left his Bedminster golf course around 4:30pm.

The former president's private jet landed shortly after 7pm. He descended the steps from his Boeing 757 jet at 7:14pm, and gave the thumbs up to waiting reporters and photographers.

Trump then climbed into his motorcade and set off for the jail, along roads closed earlier today.

He arrived at the jail, 14 miles away on Rice Street in downtown Atlanta, for booking at 7:30pm.

En route to the jail, Trump attacked 'lowlife' Fulton County district attorney Fani Willis, as he braces to become the first former president in history to pose for a mugshot and have his height and weight recorded.

It is the fourth time he will be booked in 2023 as he faces multiple criminal cases during his run for president.

'But please excuse me, I have to start getting ready to head down to Atlanta, Georgia, where Murder and other Violent Crimes have reached levels never seen before, to get ARRESTED by a Radical Left, Lowlife District Attorney, Fani Willis, for A PERFECT PHONE CALL, and having the audacity to challenge a RIGGED & STOLLEN (sic) ELECTION. THE EVIDENCE IS IRREFUTABLE! ARREST TIME: 7:30 P.M.

His post came hours after Willis requested Trump face trial in Georgia on October 23, and as his former chief of staff Mark Meadows surrendered to cops.

Willis asked for the date for Trump and the 18 co-defendants to face a judge after indicted lawyer Kenneth Chesebro asked for a speedy trial.

Donald Trump left his New Jersey golf club to fly to Atlanta for his arrest in the Georgia election fraud case

The former president's motorcade left Bedminster and headed to Newark Airport after he celebrated his interview with Tucker Carlson getting more than double a typical Super Bowl audience.

Trump has frequently attacked Willis since he was indicted over his bid to try and overturn the election.

He told Carlson on Wednesday night that she is 'getting killed,' in language similar to the rhetoric leading up to the Capitol Riot.

The former president also posted on his social media account while in the motorcade about Willis and rising crime in Atlanta.

'Why is there so much MURDER in Atlanta? Why is there so much Violent Crime? People are afraid to go outside to buy a loaf of bread! One big reason is that failed District Attorney, Fani Willis, who is campaigning and fundraising off 'get Trump' (much like the others!), doesn't have the Time, Money, or Interest to go after the real criminals, even the REALLY Violent ones, that are destroying Atlanta, and its once beautiful culture and way of life. This is yet another SAD DAY IN AMERICA!'

He references the investigation launched by House Republicans today - accusing Willis of profiting off Trump's criminal case for her campaign.

The 41-count charge against Trump and his 18 co-defendants marks the fourth and latest indictment against the ex-president.

They 'knowingly and willfully joined a conspiracy to unlawfully change the outcome of the election in favor of Trump,' the indictment stated.

Trump was charged with RICO - Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations - a count which is frequently used to try mafia figures, cartel leaders and gangland bosses.

He is also charged with solicitation of violation of oath by a public officer; conspiracy to commit forgery in the first-degree; perjury; and a host of other counts.

If convicted on all charges, he faces 71 years in prison - and state charges, unlike federal, cannot be pardoned by a president.

A handful of Trump's allies have turned themselves in to the Georgia prison so far and their mugshots have been released by the Fulton County Sheriff's Office.

An October trial date further complicates Trump's schedule as he moves to retake the White House.

Trump chose to snub the first debate, held Wednesday night in Milwaukee, and reportedly will skip the second one too in September, but he'll also have less than three months before the primary contests begin.

And October 2 is the trial date for the Trump Organization $250 million civil fraud suit, filed by New York Attorney General Letitia James.

James sued Trump, his business and his eldest three children for fraud, saying the ex-president 'wildly exaggerated his net worth by billions of dollars,' while manipulating property valuations to get tax breaks and better terms on loans and insurance policies.

The first primary contest, the Iowa caucuses, is scheduled for January 15.

Earlier Thursday, Haley was already pointing out what a time suck all of the ex-president's trials would be - suggesting it would cost him the presidential race.

'He's going to spend more time in a courtroom than he's going to spend on the campaign trail,' Haley said on Fox News Channel.",Trump leaves takes off for his 7.30pm Atlanta arrest tonight: Ex-President prepares to fly to Georgia after ripping into 'lowlife' Fani Willis and claims Tucker Carlson interview got 231 MILLION hits,1

Shrove Tuesday enthusiasts have been sharing their pancake adventures on social media - including less-than-conventional toppings, flipping fails and some batter masterpieces.

In the Christian calendar, the day marks a final day of feasting before Lent officially begins tomorrow. Social media is showing that the traditional Mardi Gras treat - fluffy discs of flour, milk and eggs whisked together and quickly fried - can take on many forms.

Pancake fans have been getting busy in the kitchen - with varying results. For every creative design that looks too pretty too eat - think squirrels, pop stars, bicycles - there's plenty more photos showing sad piles of batter on the kitchen floor.

One Twitter user remarked 'good job I'm married' after posting a photo of a chaotic batter mess.

Elsewhere, there was plenty of pancake art to behold. Why would you make a pancake to eat when you could wear it as a mask?

Others spent time painstakingly recreating their idols - including late rapper Tupac and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle - in batter; none of which looked particularly appetising.

https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-9813059/Rep-Jim-Jordan-blames-Nancy-Pelosi-Capitol-riot-rejects-Jan-6-investigation.html,1,"Rep. Jim Jordan has blamed Nancy Pelosi for allowing rioters to breach the Capitol on January 6, saying it was her responsibility as Speaker to have a proper security presence in place.

The Republican Congressman's comments came after he and Jim Banks - both known Trump supporters - were rejected by Pelosi for serving on the special committee investigating the Capitol insurrection.

'The fundamental question is why wasn't there a proper security posture that day? It wasn't like we didn't know there was a rally in town. It wasn’t like we didn’t know it would be a big rally, after all it was a President Trump rally,' the Ohio representative told Fox's Tucker Carlson on Wednesday.

'Why wasn't there a proper security presence? That is a question that only the speaker of the United States House of Representatives can answer.'

'My guess is the reason she didn't have the proper presence there is because - think about what happened last year. The Democrats normalized anarchy.

'They said oh, if you are a rioter or a looter, you are attacking police that we are defunding and you are destroying small business we are going to raise money to bail you out of jail.

'So with that background, she couldn't have the presence that you need that day.'

Republicans have pushed the security question, trying to shift the focus of the riot to Democrats, who are focusing on Trump's role.

Pelosi's office has noted neither she nor Republican Senator Mitch McConnell, who was leader of the Senate on January 6th, were in charge of security operations.

'I will say again the Speaker of the House is not in charge of the security of the U.S. Capitol Complex any more than former Senate Majority Leader McConnell was on 1/6,' Pelosi spokesperson Drew Hammill wrote on Twitter.

Security in the Capitol is run by the US Capitol Police Board, which consists of the House Sergeant at Arms, the Senate Sergeant at Arms, the Architect of the Capitol, and the head of US Capitol Police.

Republican Representatives Jim Banks (left) and Jim Jordan were rejected by Speaker Nancy Pelosi for serving on the special committee investigating the Capitol insurrection. Both lawmakers are strong Donald Trump allies

Jordan told Carlson that he believes his nomination to the committee was rejected because 'she just doesn't want to answer that fundamental question or any other questions,' referring to his question about having security in place.

Carlson agreed with Jordan, and added: 'Immediately after January 6th, Pelosi called the army in, built a wall - ironically - around building for the Capitol police, her own Praetorian guard, et cetera. So she is clearly for law enforcement when they protect her.'

Pelosi used her power as speaker to reject Jordan and Banks from the special committee on Wednesday.

In response, House GOP Leader Kevin McCarthy pulled all five of his Republican nominees to the committee, prompting a day of finger pointing.

Each side accused the other of playing politics with the panel tasked to study the origins and effects of the riot, which resulted in five deaths and damage to historic artifacts in the Capitol.

And each side feared with the other would ask: Democrats putting the focus on former President Donald Trump and his actions that day; Republicans questioning why there wasn't enough security at the Capitol, which would have fallen under Pelosi's purview as Speaker.

McCarthy charged Pelosi with 'playing politics' and creating a 'sham process' with her decision to reject Banks and Jordan, both strong allies of Trump, from serving on the panel.

'This is all political and we have known it from the start,' Jordan told Carlson on his Wednesday show.

Both Jordan and Banks voted to challenge certification of President Joe Biden's election victory and have promoted the false argument that Trump actually won in 2020 and was the victim of election fraud.

Pelosi said in a statement she made her decision based on the 'integrity' of the investigation. As speaker, Pelosi has final say on who sits on the panel.

'With respect for the integrity of the investigation, with an insistence on the truth and with concern about statements made and actions taken by these Members, I must reject the recommendations of Representatives Banks and Jordan to the Select Committee,' Pelosi said in a statement.

'The unprecedented nature of January 6th demands this unprecedented decision,' she added.

McCarthy slammed Pelosi for her decision.

'Why are you allowing a lame duck speaker to destroy this institution? This is the people's house. Not Pelosi's house,' he said in a hastily arranged press conference on Capitol Hill.

Pelosi is not a lame duck speaker. Republicans would have to win a majority in the 2022 election for that to happen.

McCarthy vowed to hold his own investigation that he said would include a look at Trump's role in the January 6th riot, where the former president's supporters stormed the Capitol to interrupt the certification of Biden's presidential victory.

'This represents an egregious abuse of power and will irreparably damage this institution,' McCarthy said in a statement blasting Pelosi's move, saying it showed 'this panel has lost all legitimacy and credibility and shows the Speaker is more interested in playing politics than seeking the truth.'

The House Select Committee to Investigate the January 6th Attack on the U.S. Capitol's investigation was expected to be highly contentious. The panel will hold its will hold its first hearing in six days, on Tuesday, July 27.

Democrats pushed for the creation of a 9/11-style commission to investigate January 6, but that was tanked by Republicans; Instead the House formed a 1/6 select committee to probe the Capitol riot (pictured)

But Pelosi's rejection of two of the other party's picks is unprecedented. Leaders of the respective parties usually respect each other's decisions.

'We need a comprehensive investigation as to who organized this attack, who paid for it, how they nearly succeeded in overthrowing a presidential election, why they did it and how we must organize ourselves to prevent anything like it from ever happening again,' she said in her statement.

The White House supported Pelosi's move.

'The President has made clear that the shameful events of January 6th deserve a full, independent, and transparent investigation to ensure something like that never happens again, and he has full confidence in the Speaker's ability to lead that work,' Biden spokesman Michael Gwin said in a statement.

Republican Rep. Liz Cheney, whom Pelosi appointed to the panel, told CNN she supported the speaker in rejecting the Republican lawmakers for the committee

As did Republican Rep. Liz Cheney, whom Pelosi appointed to the panel.

'I agree with what the Speaker has done,' she told CNN.

She also criticized McCarthy, saying he should not be speaker if Republicans win control of the House in next year's midterm election, arguing he wasn't qualified to be third in line for the presidency.

'Any person who would be third in line to the presidency must demonstrate a commitment to the constitution and a commitment to the rule of law, and Minority Leader McCarthy has not done that,' she said.

Cheney was removed from House leadership after she criticized Trump for his role in encouraging the January 6th MAGA rioters. She was one of 10 House Republicans who voted for his second impeachment.

Democratic Rep. Bennie Thompson, who Pelosi tapped to chair the panel, agreed with the speaker the rejection of Jordan and Banks was about 'integrity.'

'This is about the integrity of the investigation. Period,' he said in a statement.

'It has been more than 6 months since the attack, we owe it to our democracy to stay the course and not be distracted by side-shows. That is exactly what we will be doing next Tuesday, when the bipartisan committee members take testimony from frontline heroes who put their lives on the line to protect our democracy,' he said.

Jordan was among the group of House Republicans who met with Trump in December to help plan the effort to challenge Biden's victory. Democratic members of the committee were considering calling him as a potential witness in their investigation.

THE CAPITOL RIOT SELECT COMMITTEE: SEVEN DEMOCRATS AND ONE REPUBLICAN Speaker Pelosi appointed the eight lawmakers below as her picks to the panel investigating the January 6th MAGA riot: • Chair Bennie Thompson: Chair of Homeland Security Committee • Chair Zoe Lofgren: Chair of Committee on House Administration • Chair Adam Schiff: Chair of House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence • Rep. Pete Aguilar, House Administration and Appropriations Committees • Rep. Liz Cheney, Armed Services Committee • Rep. Stephanie Murphy, Armed Services Committee • Rep. Jamie Raskin, Oversight and Judiciary Committees • Rep. Elaine Luria, Navy veteran, Armed Services and Homeland Security Committees Advertisement

He also blasted Pelosi's move as 'politics' and argued: 'The fundamental question of why wasn't there a proper, proper security presence at the Capitol that day.'

Pelosi's spokesperson told DailyMail.com that particular GOP strategy was 'desperate'.

'On January 6th, the Speaker, a target of an assassination attempt that day, was no more in charge of Capitol security than Mitch McConnell was,' Drew Hammill said. 'This is a clear attempt to whitewash what happened on January 6th and divert blame.'

He added: 'I would hope the media would do better and treat this as the utter nonsense that it is.'

Jordan was a fiery defender of Trump when he sat on the panel investigating Trump's first impeachment.

Banks helped arrange for House Republicans to join the former president on a recent trip to the border.

'This just goes to show how partisan of an exercise we said this was all along,' he said Wednesday at the Republicans' press conference. 'She knew we would fight back against their political games, and that's why she didn't want us to participate in this committee.'

He was to serve as ranking member but, shortly after McCarthy appointed him to the panel, Banks put out a statement blasting its creation, saying it was done so 'solely to malign conservatives and to justify the Left's authoritarian agenda.'

McCarthy named his five members of his party to the panel on Monday. He also appointed Rodney Davis, Kelly Armstrong and Troy Nehls to the committee.

Nehls also voted against Biden's election certification. But Pelosi said she would accept those three lawmakers to serve.

Republicans opposed Pelosi's original call for a 9/11-style bipartisan commission. McCarthy opposed it in the House where it passed with Democratic support. But the bill died in the Senate once Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell announced he would not support it.

Republicans wanted the commission to have a larger scope - and not just study what happened on January 6, but other acts of so-called 'political violence' including last summer's Black Lives Matter protests.

House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy also had chose Rep. Kelly Armstrong (left) of North Dakota and Rep. Rodney David (right) of Illinois to serve on the 1/6 select committee

Pelosi earlier this month announced eight members of the committee, including one Republican, Rep. Liz Cheney, who has been one of the most prominent critics of former President Donald Trump.

McCarthy said at the time he was shocked that Cheney would accept Pelosi's invitation to be on the committee.

The special congressional panel was created to investigate the events leading up to and on January 6, when Trump supporters stormed the Capitol in an attempt to stop Democrat Joe Biden from being certified the winner of last November's presidential election against Trump.

Republican leaders resisted any special panel to investigate the deadly Capitol assault, noting existing congressional committees had been doing their own probes and that more than 500 people had already been charged with crimes.

Rep. Troy Nehls, a Republican from Texas, was also picked by House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy to serve on a 1/6 select committee

Some Republicans have downplayed the attack, with Rep. Andrew Clyde comparing it to a visit by tourists.

Four people died on the day of the violence, one shot dead by police and the other three of natural causes.

A Capitol Police officer who had been attacked by protesters died the following day.

Two police officers who took part in the defense of the Capitol later took their own lives. More than a hundred police officers were injured.

Just before the attack, Trump delivered fiery remarks at the White House and then encouraged his supporters to march to Capitol Hill.",Rep. Jim Jordan blames Nancy Pelosi for rioters brea after she rejects him for Jan. 6 investigation,1

The animal bolted riderless down Whitehall, careering into a blameless woman protester and a lamppost.

Groups of men hurled two ‘Boris bikes’ at police horses, startling the terrified animals. Flares were thrown over the security gates into Downing Street. Bottles and other missiles were tossed at riot squad officers as they emerged from behind the gates.

Yesterday criminality extended to Bristol, where a mob ripped down a statue of Edward Colston, a philanthropist and slave trader who died almost exactly 300 years ago. He was a man whose actions obviously can’t be defended, but the destruction of his monument was nonetheless an act of vandalism.

A young female police officer was flung violently into traffic lights outside Downing Street on Saturday evening after a demonstrator hurled a missile at her horse (pictured)

As protests continued in London yesterday, the female police officer was recovering in hospital with a collapsed lung, broken collarbone and shattered ribs. Thirteen other officers were injured in Saturday’s clashes — to add to the 13 hurt in earlier protests last week.

What cruel madness is this? It’s true that only a small minority of the demonstrators turned to violence, but by their conduct they disfigured the entire protest, whose purpose was to object to the abominable killing of George Floyd, an American black man, two weeks ago.

In which decent moral universe is it thought reasonable to attack British police officers in retaliation for the murder of an innocent black man by a psychopathic white American policeman in a city 4,000 miles away?

But it’s not only the violent agitators fomenting division who were at fault. Although, of course, their transgression was much less serious, all those who went peacefully on marches in London and other British cities over the weekend were behaving selfishly and irresponsibly. Every one of them was breaking the law.

The truth is that one undoubted injustice is not in any way ameliorated by outbreaks of violence and anti-social behaviour. One harm has been met with more pain and destruction, which dishonours rather than burnishes the memory of George Floyd. A man is pictured throwing a bike towards mounted police officers

I realise many were wearing masks, but they provide only a limited defence against infection. All these demonstrations constituted the kind of mass gatherings that have been prohibited during the lockdown because they are known to spread Covid-19.

More people will become infected, and some could die, as a result of these demos. The protesters were not merely taking a risk on their own behalf. Their actions could give the contagion a boost just when it seems finally to be under control.

Particularly appalling were pictures of demonstrators addressing or abusing police officers to their faces, while sometimes photographing them on their smartphones. God knows why most of the police weren’t wearing masks, but they weren’t. Some may have been infected by exchanges at such close quarters.

Those who went on these marches will think they were in the service of a noble cause — to decry the suffocation of an innocent black man at the hands of the police, which they believe characterised a wider brutality that stretches beyond American shores.

The truth is that one undoubted injustice is not in any way ameliorated by outbreaks of violence and anti-social behaviour. One harm has been met with more pain and destruction, which dishonours rather than burnishes the memory of George Floyd.

And what has the Labour Party said? Two weeks ago, following the Guardian’s and the Daily Mirror’s revelations, it was in the forefront of those criticising Dominic Cummings for his infractions of the lockdown. Rightly so.

But in response to the deliberate flouting of the lockdown by thousands, Labour has been almost silent. One of their number, the irrepressibly preachy MP Barry Gardiner, joined a demonstration outside Parliament last week in which little, if any, social distancing was observed.

Nor, one should add, have the Mirror and Guardian climbed the same high horse from which they criticised Mr Cummings. Far from it. Some Guardian columnists have fostered division. One of them, Afua Hirsch, wrote an incendiary piece in which she claimed that the racism which killed George Floyd ‘is a system that Britain built here’.

This is what the ‘Black Lives Matter’ protesters are alleging — that Britain is a fundamentally racist society. Little evidence is adduced. I heard one of the organisers of Saturday’s London demonstration feebly allege that the higher rate of Covid-19 fatalities among BAME people was proof of innate racism.

Yesterday criminality extended to Bristol, where a mob ripped down a statue of Edward Colston (pictured), a philanthropist and slave trader who died almost exactly 300 years ago

Only a myopic person would deny there is some racism in Britain.

Tonight on BBC1, there is a moving drama inspired by the Windrush scandal about Anthony Bryan, who after 50 years in Britain was wrongly detained by the Home Office, and threatened with deportation.

To its credit, the Guardian broke the Windrush story in 2018.

Granted that there are pockets of institutional racism in our country, I believe the widespread horror reflected across the political spectrum when the outrage first came to light suggests quite the opposite — that Britain is not a racist society.

To imply, as the protesters and their divisive journalistic cheerleaders do, that Britain is irredeemably racist — well, that is an insult to the many millions of Britons of every colour who co-exist tolerantly and peaceably with their fellow citizens.

Furthermore, the measured reaction of put-upon police officers on Saturday shows that, for all their shortcomings, our police are generally not brutish. Their American counterparts sometimes are — to whites as well as blacks, as shocking footage of police in Buffalo pushing an elderly white man to the ground last Thursday attests.

Yet what does truth matter to those who sow discord? We are in the midst of an emergency. We face scary economic challenges. This is the most ill-chosen moment imaginable for conflict and violence and self-indulgent behaviour.

I’m sure many protesters are fair-minded people. They are doubtless frustrated by weeks of lockdown, and many have time on their hands as they are not working, or attending school or university.

But these increasingly anarchic demonstrations, tenuously linked to the horrible murder of a black man far away, are serving only to drive us apart in the middle of a national crisis.",Protests dishonour the memory of George Floyd,1

'Jan. 6th was nothing short of a satirical way to overthrow a government,' Guy Reffitt wrote in the letter. 'Ask the Capitol Police for [their] opinion of how it could have been. They are grateful it wasn't a real insurrection complete with mind, body and soul.'

Reffitt, 48, made headlines in late January following his arrested after he was accused of threatening to kill his teenage son for calling police and saying he'll 'put a bullet' through his daughter's phone if she betrayed him.

He wrote the letter that was first exclusively obtained by ProPublica, and has since been added to the court filings in the criminal case against the Texas man.

It was signed by 'the 1/6ers' without including any names, and describes the D.C. jail where he - and dozens of other suspected Capitol rioters are being held - as an over-the-top patriotic atmosphere where Capitol riot suspects are forming bonds out of anger.

Images, like this one, from Jan. 6 show Guy Reffitt wearing a helmet with a camera fastened to the front of it while he allegedly stormed the Capitol

.He's also seen in the images wearing a blue jacket and what appears to be a bulletproof vest

According to an affidavit obtained by Dallas News, Reffitt told his family that he went to Washington, D.C., to 'to protect the country,' that he brought a gun with him, and that he 'stormed the Capitol'

Reffitt, 48, made headlines in late January following his arrest after he was accused of threatening to kill his teenage son, Jackson (pictured), for calling police

They recite the Pledge of Allegiance inside the jail and sing the national anthem 'all in unison, loud and proud most everyday', Reffitt said in the letter.

The '1/6ers' are 'not organized' and that there are 'no leaders,' according to Reffitt; just 'people chatting about things' because they are 'stuck here together'.

Reffitt blamed the violence on 'isolated overly emotional individuals' who wanted to put the country on notice, according to ProPublica, who was able to briefly speak to Reffitt through text messages with his wife.

'The people clearly are not happy,' Reffitt said in response to questions sent through his wife, ProPublica reported

Reffitt worked most of his life on oil rigs, but when work dried up during the coronavirus pandemic he intensified his political activity.

He focused on the Black Lives Matter movement, 'which he viewed as destructive' , and intently followed the false narrative that the election was stolen.

'Let it ring in your heart, the real reason that clock struck the hour. We all heard the hunderous ticking in our ears,' Reffitt said in the letter. 'It couldn't be ignored.

'I hope that was the only day in American history we would without doubt, feel the need to notify our government they have transgressed much too far.'

What is the Three Percenters movement? The Three Percenters are a loosely organized movement that formed in 2008, according to the Anti-Defamation League, the Jewish civil rights organization that tracks extremist groups. On its website, the right-wing group says it isn´t an anti-government militia but 'we will defend ourselves when necessary.' The Three Percenters derives its name from the belief that just 3% of the colonists rose up to fight the British. They have vowed to resist any government that infringes on the U.S. Constitution. The Oregon Three Percenters joined an armed takeover of the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge in Oregon in 2016. Dozens of people occupied the remote refuge for more than a month to protest federal control of Western lands. The group also took part in a violent right-wing rally in Portland last year.

His family told ProPublic Reffitt became more and more involved with the Three Percenters, a decentralized antigovernmental movement that takes its name from the myth that only three per cent fought the British in the American Revolution.

After Donald Trump lost the election, Reffitt's family told ProPublica he became infatuated with Trump's December 19 tweet: 'Big protest in D.C. on January 6th. Be there, will be wild!'

Reffitt told his family that he went to Washington, D.C., to 'to protect the country', and that he brought a gun with him and 'stormed the Capitol,' according to an affidavit.

Images from that day show Reffitt wearing a helmet with a camera fastened to the front of it. He's also seen in the images wearing a blue jacket and what appears to be a bulletproof vest.

FBI agents found an AR-15 rifle and a pistol during their search of Reffitt's home, according to the affidavit.

16 Aug 2024 20.04 BST Harris vows to expand poverty-fighting child tax credit, hits Trump on tax proposal As she wrapped up her speech, Kamala Harris debuted a proposal to bring back a tax credit that was credited with dramatically reducing child poverty in the single year it was in effect, and expanding it further. The expanded child tax credit cut poverty for children by about half in 2021, but expired the following year, when negotiations over renewing it broke down. Harris told voters that she would bring back the credit, and make it even more generous: As President, I’ll not only restore that tax cut, but expand it. We will provide $6,000 in tax relief to families during the first year of a child’s life. Now, think what that means. Think what that means. That is a vital, vital year of critical development of a child, and the cost can really add up, especially for young parents who need to buy diapers and clothes and a car seat and so much else. She argued that she could reduce the federal budget deficit while implementing this plan, though did not quite say how, instead hitting Donald Trump over his policies towards lowering taxes: And we will do this while reducing the deficit. Compare my plan with what Donald Trump intends to do, he plans to give billionaires massive tax cuts year after year, and he plans to cut corporate taxes by over a trillion dollars, even as they pull in record profits. And that’s on top of the $2tn tax cut he already signed into law when he was president, which, by the way, overwhelmingly, overwhelmingly went to the wealthiest Americans and corporations and exploded the national deficit.

But here’s one thing to keep in mind: it was first passed in 2010, which means there are lots of voters out there who never experienced what the American health insurance system was like before its changes took effect. Harris warned the crowd that repealing the law “would take us back to a time when insurance companies could deny people with pre-existing conditions”, she said, adding that 45 million Americans rely on the law for health coverage.

https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/apr/12/us-capitol-riot-virginia-police-officer-convicted,1,"A federal jury has convicted a former Virginia police officer of storming the US Capitol with another off-duty officer, to obstruct Congress from certifying Joe Biden’s 2020 electoral victory.

Jurors on Monday convicted former Rocky Mount police officer Thomas Robertson of all six counts he faced stemming from the 6 January riot, including charges that he interfered with police officers at the Capitol and that he entered a restricted area with a dangerous weapon – a large wooden stick.

His sentencing hearing was not immediately scheduled.

Robertson’s jury trial was the second among hundreds of Capitol riot cases. The first ended last month with jurors convicting a Texas man, Guy Reffitt, of all five counts in his indictment.

Robertson did not testify at his trial, which started 5 April. Jurors deliberated for several hours over two days before reaching their unanimous verdict.

One juror, who spoke to the Associated Press only on condition of anonymity, said as she left the courthouse, “I think the government made a really compelling case and the evidence was fairly overwhelming.”

Defense attorney Mark Rollins said Robertson will appeal the jury’s verdict. “While Mr Robertson disagrees with the jury’s decision, he respects the rule of law,” Rollins said in a statement.

A key witness for prosecutors in his case was Jacob Fracker, who also served on the Rocky Mount police force and viewed Robertson as a mentor and father figure.

Fracker was scheduled to be tried alongside Robertson before he pleaded guilty last month to a conspiracy charge and agreed to cooperate with authorities. Fracker testified Thursday that he had hoped the mob that attacked the Capitol could overturn the 2020 presidential election results.

Robertson was charged with six counts: obstruction of Congress, interfering with officers during a civil disorder, entering a restricted area while carrying a dangerous weapon, disorderly or disruptive conduct in a restricted area while carrying a dangerous weapon, disorderly or disruptive conduct inside the Capitol building, and obstruction. The last charge stems from his alleged post-riot destruction of cellphones belonging to him and Fracker.

During the trial’s closing arguments Friday, assistant US attorney Risa Berkower said Robertson went to Washington and joined a “violent vigilante mob” because he believed the election was stolen from then-president Donald Trump. He used the wooden stick to interfere with outnumbered police before he joined the crowd pouring into the Capitol, she said.

“The defendant did all this because he wanted to overturn the election,” Berkower said.

Rollins conceded that Robertson broke the law when he entered the Capitol during the riot. He encouraged jurors to convict Robertson of misdemeanor offenses but urged them to acquit Robertson of felony charges that he used the stick as a dangerous weapon and that he intended to stop Congress from certifying the electoral college vote.

“There were no plans to go down there and say, ‘I’m going to stop Congress from doing this vote,”’ Rollins said.

Fracker testified that he initially believed that he was merely trespassing when he entered the Capitol building. However, he ultimately pleaded guilty to conspiring with Robertson to obstruct Congress.

Assistant District Attorney James Kraus made the extraordinary admission as he pressed for 'a multitude of lesser charges' to be put before the jury when they are sent out to deliberate Monday.

Rittenhouse has been charged with First Degree Reckless Intentional Homicide in the death of Joseph Rosembaum, First Degree Intentional Homicide in the death of Anthony Huber and First Degree Attempted Intentional Homicide in the shooting of Gaige Grosskreutz. These are the most serious of six counts.

But today the state admitted that they had no confidence that the testimony presented in court would see him convicted as they attempted to enter second degree and lesser charges as possible verdicts across the board.

And in a startling turn of events the judge may even dismiss the least of the charges - the one that seemed a state slam-dunk - illegal possession of a firearm.

Moments later, as Rittenhouse was running down a street, he shot and killed Anthony Huber (right), 26, a protester from Silver Lake, Wisconsin

Judge Schroeder once again showed his impatience with prosecutors as they insisted that they had 'proof' the Rittenhouse had provoked Rosenbaum and pointed his gun at people before the shooting and asked for the judge to include this in his instructions to jurors.

500 National Guard troops will be on stand-by in Wisconsin for Rittenhouse verdict as police forces across America brace for acquittal 500 National Guard troops have been put on standby in Wisconsin in anticipation of a verdict in the case of Kenosha shooter Kyle Rittenhouse. Governor Tony Evers announced that the guardsmen will be stationed outside Kenosha, ready to support local police in the event of unrest over the weekend and next week. 'We continue to be in close contact with our partners at the local level to ensure the state provides support and resources to help keep the Kenosha community and greater area safe. 'The Kenosha community has been strong, resilient, and has come together through incredibly difficult times these past two years, and that healing is still ongoing. 'I urge folks who are otherwise not from the area to please respect the community by reconsidering any plans to travel there and encourage those who might choose to assemble and exercise their First Amendment rights to do so safely and peacefully,' he said. Closing arguments begin on Monday and the likelihood of an acquittal or mistrial is growing by the day. Police forces across America are preparing for potential unrest, should the verdict trigger protests in other cities. Advertisement

The usually dull, procedural matter of deciding on juror instructions became heated after Kraus claimed the proof lay in drone footage and images that, the defense contends, had been 'manipulated' by the state's expert for 20 hours.

The judge asked to see the picture. 'That's your best picture?' he asked in disgust as he squinted at the blurry image.

When Kraus pushed back saying that it was not the entirety of their proof, Judge Schroeder exploded, 'You're asking me to give in instruction I'm asking you to show me the best picture!'

Rittenhouse leaned over the judge's shoulder as he and the legal teams watched drone footage in a bid to see what the state claimed was 'clear.'

Judge Schroeder appeared unconvinced but ultimately conceded saying, 'It's the jury's case and I think they should make the critical decisions.

'My decision will be to submit the case with the provocation instruction and you can argue the strength, or lack of strength, of the evidence.'

The defense argued that the state has failed to prove the entire statute which, in Wisconsin, not only requires that a person be under 18 but that that barrel of the gun possessed is outside the legal range.

In the charges relating to the shootings first degree requires the jury to conclude that Rittenhouse displayed 'an utter disregard for human life.'

Addressing Judge Bruce Schroeder Friday morning Kraus admitted, 'When attorney Binger asked in regard to each person shot or shot at if the defendant even cared if he killed the person he alluded to, the defendant denied [it].

'He said he had to shoot him, he denied that he did not care about their life.

'I believe that the jury could find that the defendant did not have an utter disregard for human life and that he didn't really want to kill anyone.'

Schroeder denied the request saying, 'I just don't think it appropriate if I were to give this statement over the objections of the defense and the jury found a verdict on [the lesser charge] I would expect it to be reversed.'

It was the first blow to the prosecution as they attempted to open the possibility of a plethora of lesser offenses.

The judge said that he would consider including a lesser offense on the reckless endangerment charge regarding Daily Call journalist Richie McGinniss.

But he warned the prosecution should 'not be surprised' if it isn't there when he emails them the finalized list Saturday.

He did not allow a lesser charge to be included in relation to 'jump-kick man.'

Judge Bruce Schroeder will instruct the jury on the law and how they are to apply it on each charge

Defense attorney Corey Chirafisi dismissed the state's contention as 'illogical.' He said, 'It's difficult to [agree with] and argument that a jury would believe that because he stopped shooting or missed that he wasn't showing utter disregard'

Rittenhouse shot twice as an unidentified male jumped across him as he lay on the ground, kicking him in the face.

Gaige Grosskreutz was shot by Kyle Rittenhouse on August 25, 2020 and his right bicep was almost entirely blown away. Grosskreutz, the state's star witness, took the stand Monday morning

Kraus argued that a reasonable jury could find Rittenhouse guilty of second-degree reckless endangerment for the two shots he took at 'jump-kick man' even thought they might not find 'utter disregard' for human life because he 'missed' and 'stopped firing.'

Defense attorney Corey Chirafisi dismissed the state's contention as 'illogical.'

He said, 'It's difficult to [agree with] and argument that a jury would believe that because he stopped shooting or missed that he wasn't showing utter disregard.

'I think the [first degree] is the appropriate instruction. They're either going to accept it was self-defense or they're not, but to say that two shots at point blank range might not show an utter disregard because either he missed or stopped? I don't think that's logical'

The judge agreed with the defense and denied the state's request. He said, 'I do not believe there is a reasonable basis for acquittal on the greater charge and conviction on the lesser.'

The defense did not object to lesser charges being included in the charges relating to Anthony Huber and Gaige Grosskreutz. In both cases the state has asked for second degree charges to be added.

In response to the defense's objections to the gun charge faced by Rittenhouse Judge Schroeder seemed to lean towards their call for its dismissal.

After hearing arguments, he told the state to, 'go through the evidence' and see if they have 'proved [the barrel length] beyond a reasonable doubt so that [the charge] can even go to the jury,'

Judge Schroeder will decide on the final charges over the weekend.

Closing arguments in the Kenosha shooter case will begin Monday after Judge Schroeder instructs the jury on the law and how they are to apply it on each charge.

Closing arguments in Kyle Rittenhouse's murder trial will begin Monday

As it stands 18-year-old Kyle Rittenhouse is charged on six counts: First Degree Reckless Homicide, Use of a Dangerous Weapon in the death of Joseph Rosenbaum, First Degree Intentional Homicide, First Degree Attempted Intentional Homicide, Use of a Dangerous Weapon in the shootings of both Anthony Huber and Gaige Grosskreutz, First Degree Recklessly Endangering Safety in the case of Richie McGinniss who was all but in the line of fire when Rosenbaum was shot and 'jump-kick man' – the unidentified male at whom Rittenhouse shot twice – and one count of Possession of a Dangerous Weapon by a Person Under 18.

A seventh curfew violation was dismissed earlier in the week.

The most serious charges, first-degree intentional homicide, carries a mandatory life sentence, while attempted first-degree intentional homicide and first-degree reckless homicide, are both punishable by up to 60 years in prison.

State Witnesses that Turned the Tide...for the Defense They were supposed to be the state's star witnesses but their testimony could prove to be the fatal blow to it's case Daily Caller Chief Video Director Richie McGinniss upended the state’s case with his powerful testimony Thursday. Rittenhouse has been charged with reckless endangerment of McGinniss for shooting when the journalist – who had followed him and Joseph Rosenbaum - was all but in the line of fire when the teen turned and shot. A key eye-witness, McGinniss testified in court that Rosenbaum had chased Rittenhouse down then ‘lunged for the muzzle’ of his rifle in the moment that he was shot. Assistant District Attorney desperately sought to recast this as Rosenbaum ‘falling forward’ because he had been shot but McGinniss pushed back repeatedly. He told the court, ‘He was lunging, falling, I would use those as synonymous terms – he threw his momentum towards the weapon. His momentum was going forward and that’s the point in which he [Rittenhouse] fired.’ Military veteran Ryan Balch, a self-proclaimed vigilante and ‘boogaloo boi’ who was also armed with an AR-15 on the night of August 25, 2020, spent much of the evening alongside Rittenhouse. He told the court that Rosenbaum was ‘hyper-aggressive and acting out in a violent manner,’ that evening. He said that Rittenhouse was by his side when Rosenbaum, ‘got in his face’ ‘yelling and screaming.’ Most damning of all, he told the court that Rosenbaum had threatened to kill any of the group should he get them alone. According to Balch, he said, ‘If I catch any of you guys alone tonight, I’m going to f****ing kill you.’ Balch testified that when Rosenbaum said this it was within earshot of Rittenhouse. Gaige Grosskreutz should have been the state’s star witness – the sole survivor of Rittenhouse’s shootings that night. The prosecution presented him as a peaceable paramedic – the real deal where Rittenhouse was a wannabe, who falsely claimed to be an EMT. Grosskreutz, they insisted, was only there that evening to administer medical aid. The state attempted to paint him as a do-gooder who posed no threat when Rittenhouse shot him in the arm at close range shortly after shooting Anthony Huber dead. But under cross examination Grosskreutz was forced to admit that he had lied to police in his original statement when he did not admit that he was armed with a Glock 27. It was also revealed that he left this fact out of two lawsuits which he has brought, one against the city of Kenosha claiming $10million and one in Federal court. In a stunning piece of courtroom drama attorney Corey Chirafisi not only exposed Grosskreutz’s lies but converted the state’s witness by forcing his admission that he was pointing his own gun at Rittenhouse and advancing on him when he was shot. Showing images from the moment he was shot, Chirafisi pointed out, ‘You would agree that when you were three to five feet from him [Rittenhouse] with your hands up in the air, he didn’t fire did he?’ Grosskreutz agreed. Chirafisi continued, ‘It wasn’t until you were advancing on him with your gun pointed at him that he fired?’ Grosskreutz responded, ‘Correct.’ Advertisement

First-degree reckless endangermenta brutal blow to the prosecutions case carries a maximum prison term of 12 years and requires prosecutors to show that Rittenhouse put someone in harm's way by showing an utter disregard for life.

Many doubt that the prosecutors have been successful in shouldering this burden of proof.

Judge Schroeder has placed a cap of two and a half hours on closing arguments for both sides, time which is to include any rebuttal they should wish to make.

The judge had originally put a cap of one and a half hours on arguments but relented on Assistant District Attorney Thomas Binger's request for more time due to the state's intention to replay as much as 30 minutes of video footage.

But he warned, 'I will be tough. I may tell you to sit down mid-sentence if you keep going. I did it to one of the DAs recently.'

The jury will not return to the courthouse until Monday when names will be drawn to determine the 12 who will actually deliberate.

Eighteen of the original 20 jurors remain after one was excused on medical grounds and another was removed having made a racial 'joke' to a court deputy.

Judge Schroeder dismissed them for the long weekend with the words, 'We're in the final stretch now.'

The jury will not be present during these proceedings when the state is expected to inform the judge if they intend to ask for lesser charges to be considered on any counts. MONDAY Closing arguments begin and Judge Schroeder will instruct the jury on the law and how they are to apply it on each charge. The judge has placed a cap of two and a half hours on closing arguments for both sides, time which is to include any rebuttal they should wish to make. THE JURY The jury will not return to the courthouse until Monday when names will be drawn to determine the 12 who will deliberate. Eighteen of the original 20 jurors remain after one was excused on medical grounds and another was removed having made a racial 'joke' to a court deputy. THE CHARGES As it stands 18-year-old Kyle Rittenhouse is charged on six counts: First Degree Reckless Homicide, Use of a Dangerous Weapon in the death of Joseph Rosenbaum, First Degree Intentional Homicide, First Degree Attempted Intentional Homicide, Use of a Dangerous Weapon in the shootings of both Anthony Huber and Gaige Grosskreutz, First Degree Recklessly Endangering Safety in the case of Richie McGinniss who was all but in the line of fire when Rosenbaum was shot and 'jump-kick man' – the unidentified male at whom Rittenhouse shot twice – and one count of Possession of a Dangerous Weapon by a Person Under 18. A seventh curfew violation was dismissed earlier in the week. POSSIBLE SENTENCES The most serious charges, first-degree intentional homicide, carries a mandatory life sentence, while attempted first-degree intentional homicide and first-degree reckless homicide, are both punishable by up to 60 years in prison. First-degree reckless endangerment carries a maximum prison term of 12 years and requires prosecutors to show that Rittenhouse put someone in harm's way by showing an utter disregard for life.

The defense rested Thursday afternoon after two and a half days of explosive testimony and high courtroom drama that may yet see the case tossed with a mistrial.

Rittenhouse's attorneys Mark Richards and Corey Chirafisi began making their case Tuesday afternoon and quickly played their biggest card – bringing Kyle Rittenhouse to the stand Wednesday morning.

Rittenhouse, 18, broke down and sobbed on the witness stand as he recounted the events of the night of August 25, 2020 when he shot dead two men and gravely wounded a third.

He said he did not want to shoot anyone that night but did so because he was 'ambushed and attacked.'

He recalled how Joseph Rosenbaum chased and lunged at him, and voiced his belief that if Rosenbaum had managed to get his gun he would have killed him and probably a lot more people that night.

He said that he shot Anthony Huber as he felt the man pulling his gun from his body and Gaige Grosskreutz because he came at him with his own firearm, a Glock 27, pointed at him.

As Rittenhouse spoke his mother Wendy wept uncontrollably in the public gallery.

On Thursday night, his mother appeared on Fox News Wendy and said she was still angry with President Biden for his labeling her son a white supremacist last year.

But it was Assistant District Attorney Thomas Binger who brought the highest drama of the day when he was accused by both Richards and Judge Schroeder of acting 'in bad faith' and attempting to provoke a mistrial.

Binger was eviscerated by the judge for questioning Rittenhouse's right to remain silent after charges were brought.

He did this twice before the jury who the judge ultimately sent out before laying into the prosecutor and accusing him of a 'grave constitutional violation.'

Later Binger attempted to bring in evidence that had already been excluded in a pre-trial motion. The evidence was from Rittenhouse's social media and a post in which he commented about wishing he had his AR-15 so he could 'shoot some shoplifters.'

Incandescent with rage Judge Schroeder laid into Binger. When the prosecutor said he had been 'acting in good faith,' Schroeder snapped, 'I don't believe you.'

The defense has requested a mistrial based on this 'prosecutorial misconduct' and 'over-reach.' They argue that Binger was trying to provoke a mistrial to avoid the case ending in acquittal and so as to, 'have another kick at the cat' and bring a fresh prosecution.

Judge Schroeder has taken their request for a mistrial with prejudice – meaning that the case could NOT be re-tried – under consideration and has yet to make a final ruling on it.

The defense concluded their case with a use of force expert who testified that, in reality, the events that the state has sought to slow down, asking Rittenhouse what he was thinking and feeling moment by moment, took place in a matter of seconds.

From the moment that he walked through a crowd hurling rocks at police vehicles, yelling, 'Friendly! Friendly! Friendly!' to the moment he tried to surrender himself to the police just two minutes and 55 seconds elapsed.

Armed with a fire extinguisher, his medical bag and his AR-15, Rittenhouse said, 'I started running towards the Car Source number three to put out fires, pausing occasionally to catch my breath and walk

The defense also called the Kenosha Police Officer who collected the spent shell casing from the downtown road where the shootings occurred and a videographer and commentator who was an eye-witness to the night and the shooting but whom the prosecution had not called and attempted to brand as bias and intent on aiding Rittenhouse's cause.

Shortly before the defense rested the judge heard arguments concerning an expert that the state planned to recall as part of their rebuttal.

Judge Schroeder called forensic imaging expert James Armstrong to explain the algorithms used to enlarge and enhance FBI surveillance footage entered into evidence by the state.

The state argued that they should be able to enter enlarged drone footage images entered into evidence that, they claim, show Rittenhouse pointing a gun at people before he was chased by Rosenbaum.

The defense objected on grounds that the images had been altered and were not therefore accurate depictions of the original footage.

As testimony dwelt on software and pixels Judge Schroeder shook his head and joked, 'I'm still using watercolors.'

Assistant District Attorney James Kraus said that the defense's argument was 'a canard' and a 'dishonest argument.'

He said, 'With respect your honor I think the defense is trying to take advantage of your lack of technical knowledge which you've already expressed.'

He said that their attempt to present this as 'voodoo magic' was 'preposterous.'

Judge Schroeder snapped back, 'You have the burden of proof not them. The witness was just here and when he's asked what does [the software do] he says, 'I don't know.'

'This is the person who's providing your information to support your claim that it is an accurate depiction.'

The judge added, 'I will tell you that I totally agree with our comment about my lack of familiarity with these concepts although I have some logical skills. The fact that I can accurately blow something up on my phone doesn't mean that the particular crime lab is doing an accurate [job].

'What does peer review mean to me? You haven't presented any evidence as to the science or the algorithm.'

After scrutinizing the images himself Judge Schroeder allowed the evidence and said that the jury could draw their own conclusions.

More than 100 officers were out in force around St Helen's Catholic Church in North Watford, where rules on social gatherings meant just 30 travellers were allowed inside to say farewell to the deceased Mary Nevin.

The police operation is thought to have cost tens of thousands of pounds and included at least six riot vans, and dozens of police motorcycles.

The procession around local roads was flanked by motorcycle outriders, who blocked traffic at each junction to allow the cortege to pass by.

There were 30 people inside the church but around a dozen more attended and stayed behind police lines. Funerals are limited to 30 attendees in total.

Onlookers estimated the police in attendance outnumbered mourners by approximately three-to-one.

Earlier police chiefs had spoken of fears that mourners might try to flout laws on social gathering.

The alarm was raised on Friday when 30 traveller vehicles were spotted gathered at a local school.

Hertfordshire constabulary sent warning letters to locals to expect large numbers at the event and saying they expected traffic disruption around Watford, Hemel Hempstead and Redbourne.

Fearing crowds of mourners, senior officers held a series of urgent meetings yesterday with the deceased's family, funeral directors, the church, and Watford Borough Council.

Today officers were placed as look-outs on roads for miles around from early morning to gather intelligence on numbers arriving.

But by the afternoon police chiefs were breathing a sigh of relief that no flare-ups had occurred.

Afterwards the family filed out of the church to a lone piper playing the Irish lament Raglan Road before the small convoy set off to an undisclosed burial site in Bedfordshire.

Before leaving an undertaker issued a warning that vehicles at the cemetery would be limited to five.

'All agencies are working to prevent breaches from occurring by engaging ahead of time with family members.

'The funeral directors will be working to keep the number of mourners inside the church to within the 30-person limit.'

He added: 'In policing the pandemic, Hertfordshire Constabulary is following the National Police Chiefs' Council (NPCC) guidelines in applying the coronavirus regulations in our response to any breaches.

'Our officers are well-briefed on what this entails and are moving through the four Es of engagement, explaining, encouraging and finally to enforcing the coronavirus regulations if necessary.

'It is always our intention to seek prevention first and enforcement last.'

https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-9164067/New-poll-says-70-disapprove-Donald-Trump-handled-transition.html,1,"President Donald Trump continues to face sharp public disapproval for his handling of the presidential transition.

As Trump prepares to leave the White House Wednesday without participating in inaugural ceremonies for his successor, 70 per cent of Americans disapprove of his handling of the transition.

The period includes a tumultuous two months where Trump lost the election, contested the results, called the election rigged, and spoked to supporters who went on to storm the Capitol. He also got impeached in the House, with 10 House Republicans joining the 232 lawmakers who passed an article charging him with 'incitement of insurrection.'

As President Donald Trump prepares to leave office Wednesday, 70 per cent of Americans disapprove of his handling of the transition

Trump's favorability rating is just 33 per cent, with only 34 per cent approving of his job as president, according to a CNN / SSRS poll.

President-elect Joe Biden has seen his own numbers climb, with a 59 per cent favorability rating.

The poll has a 65 per cent majority saying Biden legitimately won enough votes for the presidency, with 32 per cent saying he did not legitimately win enough votes – amid repeated attacks on the election by Trump and his team.

Joe Biden won about 7 million votes more than Trump in the popular vote, and beat him in the electoral college 306 to 232.

The poll was conducted January 4 -15, a period that included two Georgia Senate runoffs that Republicans lost, the Trump rally, the MAGA riot, and the House impeachment.

Another poll question revealed Republican Party popularity of just 32 per cent, with 62 per cent disapproval.

Americans want to move on from Trump rather than see the Republican Party treat him as its leader by 77 to 19 per cent – at a time when Republican senators must soon decide whether to back him or vote to convict him.

Joe Biden's favorability rating is 59 per cent in the new CNN / SSRS poll

Trump's 34 per cent approval in a Gallup poll released Monday is the lowest approval rating of his term – which featured previous dips during the clash in Charlottesville in 2017, arrests of associates in the Russia probe, and Trump's threats to rain 'fire and fury' upon North Korea.

The president, who soaked up polling information even as he regularly blasted public polls that partnered with major media organizations, never cracked 50 per cent. He is the only president not to do so since Gallup started measuring presidential job approval in 1938 under F.D.R.

That poll was conducted January 4 through January 15, a period that includes the Capitol riots.

It all coincided with a 12-point post-election drop. Most presidents enjoy a bump after being defeated at the polls.

Trump and Richard Nixon are the only ones to score their worst rating in their final Gallup poll.

His average approval during his presidency was 41 per cent, a record low that is worse than Truman's by 4 points.",New poll says 70% disapprove of how Donald Trump has handled his transition,1
https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/aug/13/liz-cheney-primary-election-wyoming-january-6,1,"Darin Smith says he remembers January 6 very differently from Liz Cheney and her congressional colleagues investigating the US Capitol riot.

“People were singing patriotic songs, the national anthem, hymns,” insists Smith, who was outside the Capitol that day to protest about Donald Trump’s election defeat. “There was a group of grey-haired ladies – the average age had to have been mid-70s – that were praying.”

Nineteen months later, Smith is sitting in a cafe in his home city of Cheyenne in the western state of Wyoming. He condemns the violence that took place inside the Capitol but, despite a mountain of evidence, scoffs at the idea that Trump was responsible. And he is adamant that Cheney, his representative in Congress, should pay a price for her anti-Trump crusade.

The three-term congresswoman may lose her seat in Tuesday’s Republican primary election in Wyoming, the most watched congressional primary of the year. Opinion polls show Cheney trailing Harriet Hageman, conservative lawyer and vehicle of Trump’s vengeance, and defeat for the clarion voice of the January 6 panel will, in many eyes, make her a martyr for American democracy.

It will also signal a tectonic shift in Wyoming, the least populated state in America and one of the most devoutly Republican. Its most consequential political figure is Dick Cheney, vice-president under George W Bush and father of Liz. Last week, in cowboy hat, fleece and gruff tones, he recorded a campaign video for her, excoriating Trump as a “coward” and saying there has never been anyone who is a “greater threat to our republic”.

Victory for Hageman would therefore be widely interpreted as a repudiation of Wyoming’s most venerable political dynasty, evidence that the state Republican party no longer belongs to the Cheneys but to Trump. That would reflect a final national pivot away from the Bush era establishment to the “Make America Great Again” movement – from old school conservatism to far-right populism.

Smith, wearing a blue T-shirt that said “1776 Forever Free”, grey shorts and black flip-flops, is in no doubt which camp he belongs to. Last year he was a candidate in the Republican primary for Cheney’s House seat, raised $400,000 and made a pilgrimage to Trump’s golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey, to seek the former president’s all-important endorsement.

“It was like speed dating, my wife said,” the 48-year-old lawyer recalls. “I said, ‘I have a poll right here, sir, that shows that I could win today. Actually the polling that we took says that I could beat anybody in the state except for you, sir.’ He said, ‘Let me see that poll!’”

The pitch was unsuccessful and Trump gave Hageman the nod instead; Smith abandoned his campaign within a day and insists that he is not bitter. He is “100% behind Harriet Hageman” and shares her doubts – repeatedly debunked – about the legitimacy of the 2020 presidential election. “Liz Cheney, in our minds, betrayed the constitution, betrayed the nation, and we’re going to send her packing.”

Smith argues that Cheney – one of 10 House Republicans who voted to impeach Trump for inciting an insurrection – is bitter about Trump’s criticism of her father as the mastermind of a neoconservatism that led to the torturing of suspects, opening of a prison at Guantánamo Bay and waging of an illegal war on Iraq.

“It was a vendetta. She’s mad at Trump because Trump pointed out the truth of the Cheney foreign policy. Her dad is responsible for millions of deaths worldwide and trillions of dollars in spending from the US government. She’s pissed about it and she’s a narcissist and she saw her opportunity to go for Trump’s throat and she did.

“But it’s bigger than that. She wants to be the first woman president. We all know that. We’re not stupid. She’s going to ‘educate’ us in the constitution and how ‘we’re wrong and she’s right.’ Well, she’s got news and she’s got something coming for her on Tuesday of next week. She’s gonna find out if she educated us or not.”

The accusation that Cheney, 56, is driven by personal ambition in Washington, rather than by the needs of her constituents in Wyoming, is common among her critics here.

They complain that she has devoted more time to the televised hearings of the January 6 committee, where she serves as vice-chair, than to retail politics in her home state. Her campaign ads emphasise her role on the national stage as a defender of the constitution.

James King, a political science professor at the University of Wyoming, said Cheney’s opponent has seized on the theme that “she is too much Washington and not enough Wyoming”.

He added: “Certainly her participation in the committee and its public hearings have done nothing to change that view; if anything, it would be reinforcing it. It’s not just a support or not support Trump; it’s also, they will argue, too much the national and not enough the state: ‘She’s not of Wyoming any longer.’ It’s easy to say this is about Donald Trump but from the state angle it’s: ‘You’re not paying attention to us.’”

Indeed, Cheney has raised more than $13m largely thanks to donations from outside Wyoming, a vast sum for a congressional primary and far ahead of Hageman, who has travelled the state extensively to court voters. This, too, is seen as evidence that the incumbent is beholden to outside interests.

In Cheyenne, the state capital, Dianna Burchett, 62, a nurse who has voted for Cheney in the past, said: “She was put in office to do what the people of Wyoming wanted her to do and she went against the people of the state. She needs to keep her views to herself but she’s on a witch-hunt or blood hunt. It’s inexcusable.”

Laura Harnish, 53, an administrator who used to sit on an election committee for Dick Cheney, added: “I wouldn’t vote for Liz Cheney if she was the last person on the ballot. The January 6 committee was very badly done. She wasn’t representing Wyoming at that point. I vote for you. That’s who you represent: Wyoming. If you’re not going to do that then you don’t need to be in office. You need to find something else to do.”

In Wyoming, home to just 581,348 people, voters expect a certain level of intimacy with politicians. Mike Sullivan, the state’s former governor, described it as “a small town with unusually long streets”, and locals say that anyone who suffers a flat tyre never has to wait long for a helping hand.

In Cheyenne, the “Magic City of the Plains”, members of the public can wander freely about the state capitol building with a lack of security restrictions that evokes an earlier time. The house of representatives chamber nods to the state’s origins with paintings representing “cattlemen”, “homesteaders”, “stage coach” and “trappers”.

Wyoming has long had a way-out-west independent streak: in 1869 it became the first territory or state to grant women the right to vote and, in 1925, elected America’s first female governor, Nellie Tayloe Ross. Known as both the “Equality State” and “Cowboy State”, in the 1990s it welcomed visitors with signs that proclaimed: “Like no place on earth.”

Even today it can feel remote from national trends. It has no major professional sports team and, since 1983, no scheduled passenger rail service. The state museum in Cheyenne notes that “for centuries, Wyoming was a place to journey through rather than a destination … the ‘Highway of the West’.”

But in 2020 this was the state where Trump scored his biggest margin of victory, 43 percentage points. In downtown Cheyenne, the Republican party office window displays a prominent sign: “Election integrity”. Inside, in uneasy coexistence, the wall features portraits of former presidents Abraham Lincoln, Ronald Reagan and Trump as well as a commemorative photo of Bush and Cheney’s inauguration in 2001.

Loyalty to the Cheneys still runs deep in some quarters. On Tuesday afternoon, Richard Gage, 67, a lawyer, was hosing bushes outside his office. The lifelong Republican reflected: “She’s done a great job and she’s one of the few people with the courage to stand up to Donald Trump. He’s trying to destroy my democracy. He’s trying to overturn an election that he lost and that’s a direct threat to democracy itself.”

Gage has a Cheney sign displayed prominently and said it has resulted in rubbish being thrown on his lawn, a glimpse of how this campaign has taken on a menacing tone. Cheney herself has faced death threats and been forced to abandon traditional campaign stops and public rallies in favour of small-scale private events.

Joseph McGinley, a Republican county state committeeman who praises Cheney for “leadership in action” and believes she “would make a great president”, said: “There have been people that are supporting Hageman that have been stealing Cheney signs and vandalising Cheney signs.

“I was away for the weekend and came back and half the Cheney signs were gone, even in our neighbourhood, not in a very public area. The stealing of Cheney signs is a real thing and that’s unfortunate. It shows the people that are supporting Hageman are willing to do anything and they’re afraid Cheney is going to win.”

McGinley, 47, a doctor and entrepreneur based in Casper, said the battle for the soul of the state party can be traced back to the conservative Tea Party movement during the Barack Obama era. “They truly put in a ground game and it was many years and, if you were in the party, you could actually see it occurring.”

This made for a party shifting under the Cheneys’ feet. Dick is deep in retirement but Liz has effectively been excommunicated by the state party, which voted last year to censure her before deciding to stop recognising her as a Republican altogether. Local party offices offer yard signs for Hageman and many other Republicans on the ballot but not Cheney.

The congresswoman has therefore turned to an unlikely group for help: Democrats. Her campaign website features a link to a form allowing voters to change their party affiliation to Republican to take part in the Republican primary. This unusual move is based on an appeal to pragmatism in what is effectively a one-party state; Wyoming has voted Republican in every presidential election since 1968.

It appears to be working. In January, according to the secretary of state’s office, there were 196,179 registered Republicans in the state and 45,822 registered Democrats. As of 1 August, this had shifted to 207,674 registered Republicans and 39,753 registered Democrats.

David Martin, communications director of the Wyoming Democratic party, said: “I know a few people personally who have already switched over. I don’t think I’ll ever forget what one of them told me and she put it bluntly: ‘I’m voting to keep the crazies out.’”

No “crossover” voter is more prominent than Sullivan, the former governor, who after six decades as a registered Democrat recently switched to Republican so he could vote for Cheney. The 82-year-old retired lawyer explained by phone from Casper: “There are times when politics takes a backseat. Her work has been extraordinary and it’s reflective of both her intellect and her leadership.”

Sullivan, who served as governor from 1987 to 1995, said he was aware of Cheney yard signs being defaced or torn down in his neighborhood. “The nature of Liz’s opposition is more mean-spirited than when I was in office. You can attribute that to a lot of things but certainly President Trump opened the door to make that more mainstream than it has otherwise been.”

Cheney has not ruled out a 2024 presidential run as a Republican or an independent. Asked if he would consider supporting her, Sullivan replied: “I’d have to make that decision at the time. Now, whether I can picture her running for president under the circumstances in which she finds herself, I don’t know. I’m convinced she’s going to come out with a very powerful legacy: the profile in courage sort of legacy that is going to put her in good stead.”

Like her father, who under President Gerald Ford was the youngest chief of staff in White House history, Cheney plays a decades-long game. At one of the January 6 hearings, she reminded fellow Republicans that there will come a day when Trump is gone. Defeat on Tuesday might be the end of one career but the launchpad for another with even greater ambitions.

Not all Democrats, however, are ready to embrace a conservative who used to appear regularly on Rupert Murdoch’s Fox News and, according to the FiveThirtyEight website, voted in line with Trump’s position 93% of the time during his presidency.

Ted Hanlon, 63, running a long-shot campaign for the state senate, said: “I’ve been in Wyoming all my life. I knew her and I knew her dad and I have no evidence yet that a Cheney did something that was not self-serving.

“I’m glad she’s doing the January 6 hearings. If any other Republicans had been on the January 6 committee it would not have gone as well as it has and would not have come as close to the truth as it has. So I’m grateful that she’s there. It does not cause me to admire her in any way though.”",‘Not enough Wyoming’? Liz Cheney fights for the votes of her disgruntled constituents,1

In a dramatic intervention, General Sir Patrick Sanders said the country faces a '1937 moment' over Vladimir Putin's 'brutal aggression' - a reference to the notorious policy of giving ground to the German dictator before the Second World War.

He said the will to 'act rapidly' was the only way to prevent Russia's expansionism ending in all-out war in Europe.

'I will have an answer to my grandchildren should they ever ask what I did in 2022,' General Sanders said, adding that Beijing will be 'watching carefully' to see how the West responds.

Underlining the stark message, Defence Secretary Ben Wallace is expected to call for a major boost to military spending at the same Royal United Services Institute conference later.

The calls for armament came after NATO - which is holding a crunch summit in the coming days - declared it is surging the number of troops on high alert from 40,000 to 300,000 troops, and sending more heavy weaponry to its eastern flank.

The alliance's Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg called it 'the biggest overhaul of our collective defence and deterrence since the Cold War'.

General Sanders' warning came after he wrote to all the troops under his command telling them they must prepare 'to fight in Europe once again'.

'If we fail to deter there are no good choices,' he said. 'We must therefore meet strength with strength and be unequivocally prepared to fight.'

In a dramatic intervention, General Sir Patrick Sanders said the country faces a '1937 moment' over Vladimir Putin's 'brutal aggression' - a reference to the notorious policy of giving ground to the German dictator before the Second World War

In his first public engagement since taking up his post, Gen Sanders will say his focus is on mobilising the Army to help prevent the spread of war in Europe by being 'ready to fight and win alongside our Nato allies and partners'.

'In all my years in uniform, I haven't known such a clear threat to the principles of sovereignty and democracy, and the freedom to live without fear of violence, as the brutal aggression of president Putin and his expansionist ambitions,' he said.

'I believe we are living through a period of history as profound as our forebears did... This is our 1937 moment. We are not at war – but must act rapidly so that we aren't drawn into one through a failure to contain territorial expansion...

'I will do everything in my power to ensure that the British Army plays its part in averting war.

'I will have an answer to my grandchildren should they ever ask what I did in 2022.'

General Sanders cautioned that Russia had a track record of starting wars 'badly' but could 'still ultimately prevail'.

'Historically Russia often starts wars badly. Because Russia wages war at the strategic and not the tactical level its depth and resilience means it can suffer any number of campaigns, battles and engagements lost and yet regenerate and still ultimately prevail,' he said.

'While Russia's conventional capability will be reduced for a time at least, Putin's declared intent to restore the lands of historic Russia makes any respite temporary and the threat will become even more acute.

'We don't know how the war in Ukraine will end but in most scenarios Russia will be an even greater threat to European security after Ukraine than it was before.

'The Russian invasion has reminded us of that time-honoured maxim that if you want to avert conflict you had better be prepared to fight.'

Despite the recent emphasis on new capabilities, such as drones and cyber warfare, he will say that land forces will remain crucial in any conflict, adding: 'You can't cyber your way across a river.'

In a reference to the start of the First War World, Gen Sanders said that 'this is not the rush to war at the speed of the railway timetables of 1914'.

Instead he said deterring Russia means 'more of the Army ready more of the time' from 'the general in (Ministry of Defence) Main Building, to the young lance corporal in the barrack room, from the reservist on a weekend exercise, to the civil servant in Army headquarters'.

In a speech on Tuesday, General Sir Patrick Sanders, the Chief of the General Staff, will say he had never seen such a clear threat to peace and democracy as the 'brutal aggression' of Russian president Vladimir Putin

The calls for armament came as NATO said Monday it would boost its high readiness force from 40,000 to 300,000 troops

Wallace calls for 20% hike in defence spending Britons were today warned they face more tax rises to fund higher defence spending as the West counters the threat from Russia. Economists said the Treasury could need to raise more revenue if it agrees to a demand from Ben Wallace for £10billion extra funding. In a letter to Boris Johnson, the Defence Secretary highlighted alarming gaps in capabilities such as a lack of drones, not enough pilots to fly multi-billion-pound stealth jets and a shortage of crew aboard Royal Navy nuclear submarines. In a landmark speech at a RUSI conference today, Mr Wallace will argue that the UK's annual defence budget should rise to 2.5 per cent of GDP by 2028 - well above the Nato minimum of 2 per cent. The respected IFS think-tank said the increase would be a 'big deal' and take funding back to 1990s levels. Director Paul Johnson pointed out that the tax burden is already due to reach record levels as the government tries to balance the books in the wake of Covid. Tweeting a chart showing how more money for health budgets had been found by easing back on military spending since the 1950s, Mr Johnson said: 'Reduction in defence spending over past 60 years made way for welfare state without need to raise taxes. 'No further scope to cut it and taxes are rising to record levels. If spending on defence *rises* again then more tax rises, or curtailing of welfare state, will be needed.' Advertisement

Boris Johnson is preparing to join other Nato leaders in Madrid for a summit at which they are expected to agree the biggest overhaul of the Western military alliance since the end of the Cold War.

Mr Wallace is understood to have asked Mr Johnson in a letter to lift the annual military budget from the current Nato minimum target of 2 per cent of GDP to 2.5 per cent by 2028.

'The Defence Secretary and the Prime Minister have always said that the Government will respond to any changes in threat which is why in 2020 the Ministry of Defence received a record defence settlement,' they said.

Liz Truss said Nato should focus on increasing flexibility in resource deployment, the use of modern techniques such as 'hybrid warfare, the weaponisation of migration, the use of cyber attack', and spending more on defence.

'Two percent needs to be a floor, not a ceiling for defence spending', the Foreign Secretary said in an interview with Die Welt, La Repubblica and El Pais.

In his speech, Mr Wallace will reiterate his call for increased investment in defence to meet the changing international environment.

In March the Defence Secretary wrote to Chancellor Rishi Sunak ahead of his spring statement warning UK defence spending was set to drop below the Nato minimum of 2 per cent of GDP by the middle of the decade unless the Treasury committed more resources.

A defence source said: 'The Defence Secretary is expected to emphasise that now that the threat has changed, governments must be prepared to invest to keep us safe.'

As well as Britain's commitments, Washington has announced it plans to send Ukraine sophisticated anti-aircraft missiles.

The summit of the G7 - which comprises Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the United States - wraps up today and will be immediately followed by a NATO meeting in Spain.

In Brussels, NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg announced plans to expand the alliance's rapid-reaction forces as part of its response to an 'era of strategic competition'.

The NATO response force currently has about 40,000 soldiers.

NATO will agree to deliver further military support to Ukraine - including secure communication and anti-drone systems - when its leaders convene in Spain for a summit later this week, Stoltenberg said.

The Ministry of Defence said Putin is likely to rely increasingly on reserve forces in the coming weeks.

Analysts have said a call-up of reservists by Russia could vastly alter the balance in the war but could also come with negative political consequences for Putin's government.

It comes after Russia attacked a shopping centre – leaving at least 13 dead - in apparent provocation to coincide with the G7 summit in Bavaria.

Scores of civilians were feared killed or wounded in a Russian missile strike Monday on a crowded shopping mall in Ukraine's central city of Kremenchuk, Ukrainian officials said.

At least 13 people were dead and more than 40 wounded by two long-range X-22 missiles fired from Tu-22M3 bombers that flew from Shaykovka airfield in Russia's Kaluga region, said Ukraine's air force command.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said in a Telegram post that the number of victims was 'unimaginable,' citing reports that more than 1,000 civilians were inside at the time of the attack.

'The Russian strike today on the shopping centre in Kremenchuk is one of the most brazen terrorist acts in European history,' he said in his evening broadcast posted on Telegram.

Images from the scene showed giant plumes of black smoke from a shopping center engulfed in flames, as emergency crews rushed in and onlookers watched in distress.

Zelensky said the target presented 'no threat to the Russian army' and had 'no strategic value.' He accused of Russia of sabotaging 'people's attempts to live a normal life, which make the occupiers so angry.'

Mr Johnson condemned Vladimir Putin's 'cruelty and barbarism', speaking on the day Zelensky addressed the G7 summit to urge G7 leaders to supply missile defence systems, and said it would strengthen the resolve of allies to resist Putin.

The PM said: 'This appalling attack has shown once again the depths of cruelty and barbarism to which the Russian leader will sink.

'Once again our thoughts are with the families of innocent victims in Ukraine.

'Putin must realise that his behaviour will do nothing but strengthen the resolve of the Ukraine and every other G7 country to stand by the Ukraine for as long as it takes.'

Floyd died while in custody of the Minneapolis Police Department on Monday and in the days following rallies took place in the city as well as Los Angeles. But the protests turned to looting, with some people being tear gassed and seriously injured.

Tim Walz said Thursday that the National Guard was being activated to help protect those who wished to live and demonstrate in a peaceful manner.

Walz said that communities must continue to seek justice for Floyd and other African Americans who have been a victim of police brutality, and try to change the system so that it cannot happen again.

However the state has exhausted its resources and needs additional help from the National Guard after stores were set on fire amid the unrest.

Minneapolis and St. Paul activated their emergency operations plan, and the Mayors of both cities requested the assistance of the Minnesota National Guard. Pictured, protests erupted in violence and armed vigilantes patroled Minneapolis streets in second night of violence

In this Wednesday photo, a looter uses a claw hammer as he tries to break in to a cash register at a Target store in Minneapolis. Rioters ignited fires and looted stores all over the city, as peaceful protests turned increasingly violent in the aftermath of the death of George Floyd

Protests came after George Floyd (left and right) was filmed Monday begging a Minneapolis cop to stop kneeling on him and telling him he could not breathe (left) before he lost consciousness and died

City officials on Wednesday formally identified the four fired police officers involved in Monday's incident as Derek Chauvin, Thomas Lane, Tou Thao, and J Alexander Kueng.

The cops, who were initially placed on paid administrative leave, were terminated from the Minneapolis Police Department on Tuesday after footage of Floyd's arrest was widely shared on social media.

But demonstrators want the cops arrested and charged with murder after Chauvin was seen kneeling on Floyd's neck for eight minutes and other officers held the victim down.

'Our state watched Mr. Floyd's humanity be erased. Our feelings of anguish, anger, and disillusionment are justified, and we must continue to seek justice and fairness,' Walz said in a statement. 'We must continue to examine and address the systemic inequities and discrimination that led to this incident and many others in the past.'

Walz continued: 'Since Mr. Floyd's death, thousands of Minnesotans have expressed their frustration in a peaceful and constructive manner. Demonstrators have gathered in Minneapolis, St. Paul, and surrounding communities to protest Mr. Floyd's death.

State cops wielded batons and wore body armor and helmets as they lined up against the rioters. But on Thursday the Governor of Minnesota said they had exhausted their resources

Tim Walz said Thursday that the National Guard will help maintain safety in the wake of George Floyd's death. He signed the order for a peacetime emergency, mentioning the people of Minneapolis and surrounding communities. Right, he is pictured at a news conference on Wednesday

Walz said that looters and violence seen at protests threaten the safety of lawful demonstrators, other Minnesotans and first responders. Pictured, protesters gathered outside the home of police officer Derek Chauvin Wednesday, calling him a 'Murderer'

'Peaceful demonstrations are a keystone of our democratic system. We must also allow those who wish to protest peacefully to do so safely.'

'Unfortunately, some individuals have engaged in unlawful and dangerous activity, including arson, rioting, looting, and damaging public and private property.

'These activities threaten the safety of lawful demonstrators and other Minnesotans, and both first responders and demonstrators have already been injured. '

A fatal shooting and lawsuit for excessive force: What we know about the four officers fired for George Floyd's arrest Derek Chauvin In 2006 Derek Chauvin (pictured), 44, was one of six officers connected to the death of Wayne Reyes The white police officer who knelt on George Floyd's neck has already been investigated over three police shootings and a fatal car chase. In 2006 Derek Chauvin, 44, was one of six officers connected to the death of Wayne Reyes. Reyes, 42 was killed by officers after allegedly pulling a shotgun on the six cops, which included Chauvin. Also that year he was named in a lawsuit filed by an inmate at the Minnesota Correctional Facility. The case was dismissed in 2007. Two years later Chauvin was investigated for his role in the 2008 shooting of Ira Latrell Toles during a domestic assault call. Toles was wounded after police said he went for an officer's gun and Chauvin shot him. That same year Chauvin was handed a medal of valor for 'his response in an incident involving a man armed with a gun.' But in 2011 23-year-old Leroy Martinez was shot and injured during a chase given by officers including Chauvin. Chauvin was arrested Friday - four days after Floyd's death - and charged with third degree murder and manslaughter. Tou Thao Tou Thao (pictured), was part of a $25,000 out of court settlement after being sued for using excessive force in 2017 Tou Thao, was part of a $25,000 out of court settlement after being sued for using excessive force in 2017. A lawsuit obtained by the DailyMail.com shows Thao was sued for using excessive force in arrest where he was accused of punching and kicking a handcuffed suspect 'until his teeth broke'. The remaining two officers have been identified as Thomas Lane and J Alexander Kueng. Both were reportedly rookie cops who were still in their probationary periods. Thao, Lane and Kueng do not currently face charges. Advertisement

Footage and video showed stores such as Target and Walmart destroyed and robbed.

But smaller businesses were also targeted.

'Many businesses, including businesses owned by people of color, have suffered damage as a result of this unlawful activity,' Walz continued.

'The City of Minneapolis has exhausted its resources and called for assistance from mutual aid partners to ensure immediate response to protect life, safety, and property.

'These mutual aid partners have fully committed their available resources.

'The Cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul have activated their emergency operations plan, and the Mayors of both cities have requested the assistance of the Minnesota National Guard to help provide security and restore safety.'

Walz explained that the State Emergency Operations Center (SEOC) is currently activated for the COVID-19 response and has implemented the Minnesota Emergency Operations Plan.

But now it will concurrently support both the 2 COVID-19 response, plus the City of Minneapolis, the City of St. Paul, and surrounding communities amid the unrest.

'For these reasons, I declare a peacetime emergency in the City of Minneapolis, the City of St. Paul, and surrounding communities,' Walz continued.

He ordered as follows:

The Adjutant General will order to state active duty on May 28, 2020 the personnel, equipment, and facilities needed to support emergency operations and response. The Adjutant General is authorized to procure the goods and services needed to accomplish the mission. The Department of Public Safety's Division of Homeland Security and Emergency Management will continue to coordinate the provision of on-site support and assistance to affected local government and assess the need for supplementary emergency assistance. State agencies, in cooperation with appropriate federal agencies, will provide assistance to local units of government as they respond to and recover from this emergency. The costs of this assistance shall be paid from the general fund as allowed by Minnesota Statutes 2019, section 192.52. This Executive Order and declaration of peacetime emergency is effective immediately under Minnesota Statutes 2019, section 4.035, subdivision 2, and its duration is governed by Minnesota Statutes 2019, section 12.31, subdivision 2.

Walz explained more in a series of tweets Thursday evening.

He mentioned Floyd's grieving family calling for an end to the violence and said Floyd himself would want the communities to be safe.

'It is time to rebuild. Rebuild the city, rebuild our justice system, and rebuild the relationship between law enforcement and those they're charged to protect. George Floyd's death should lead to justice and systemic change, not more death and destruction,' Walz tweeted.

'As George Floyd's family has said, he 'would not want people to get hurt. He lived his life protecting people.' Let's come together to rebuild, remember, and seek justice for George Floyd. As Governor, I will always defend the right to protest.

'It is how we express pain, process tragedy, and create change. That is why I am answering our local leaders' request for Minnesota National Guard assistance to protect peaceful demonstrators, neighbors, and small businesses in Minnesota.'

The Minneapolis unrest ravaged several blocks in the Longfellow neighborhood, with scattered rioting reaching for miles across the city on Wednesday.

'George Floyd's death should lead to justice and systemic change, not more death and destruction,' Walz tweeted after the National Guard was activated

Another protest was announced for Thursday evening near county offices in downtown Minneapolis. Some stores in Minneapolis and the suburbs closed early, fearing more strife. The city shut down its light-rail system and planned to stop all bus service out of safety concerns.

Around midday Thursday, the violence spread a few miles away to a Target in St. Paul's Midway neighborhood, where police said 50 to 60 people rushed the store attempting to loot it. Police and state patrol squad cars later blocked the entrance, but the looting then shifted to shops along nearby University Avenue, one of St. Paul's main commercial corridors, and other spots in the city.

St. Paul spokesman Steve Linders said authorities have been dealing with unrest in roughly 20 different areas throughout the city.

'Please stay home. Please do not come here to protest. Please keep the focus on George Floyd, on advancing our movement and on preventing this from ever happening again. We can all be in that fight together,' St. Paul Mayor Melvin Carter tweeted.

By Thursday morning in Minneapolis, smoke rose from smoldering buildings in the Longfellow neighborhood, scene of the worst violence.

In a strip mall across the street from the police's 3rd Precinct station, the focus of the previous night's protests, the windows in nearly every business had been smashed, from the large Target department store at one end to the Planet Fitness gym at the other. Only the 24-hour laundromat appeared to have escaped unscathed.

'WHY US?' demanded a large expanse of red graffiti scrawled on the wall of the Target. A Wendy´s restaurant across the street was charred almost beyond recognition.

'We´re burning our own neighborhood,' said a distraught Deona Brown, a 24-year-old woman standing with a friend outside the precinct station, where a small group of protesters were shouting at a dozen or so stone-faced police officers in riot gear. 'This is where we live, where we shop, and they destroyed it.'

'What that cop did was wrong, but I´m scared now,' Brown told the Associated Press.

But others in the crowd saw something different in the wreckage.

Protesters destroyed property 'because the system is broken,' said a young man who identified himself only by his nickname, Cash, and who said he had been in the streets during the violence. He dismissed the idea that the destruction would hurt residents of the largely black neighborhood.

'They're making money off of us,' he said angrily of the owners of the destroyed stores.

Pupils leapt from third-floor windows and were seen crawling away from the building after the shooter, named locally as Ilnaz Galyaviev, stormed in just after 9.20am.

Galyaviev, a former pupil, is purportedly seen on chilling footage walking towards the school gates with a gun in one hand and a bag in the other before he launched the appalling assault.

Horrific videos showed young children covered in blood lying on the grass outside the building in the aftermath as their weeping parents and teachers bandaged their wounds.

English teacher Elvira Ignatieva, 26, was reportedly killed in the massacre. She had worked at the school for the last four years after graduating from university and was nominated for 'teacher of the year' in her district in 2018.

The suspect, who claimed on social media that he would kill himself, was taken into custody alive. Footage showed a police officer pinning him to the ground outside the front entrance to the school.

Galyaviev was later pictured in the police station, tied up in an iron cage, where he reportedly told officers that he was 'god' and that he 'hated everybody.'

Despite earlier reports of multiple gunmen, Rustam Minnikhanov, president of the Tatarstan region, said: 'We have lost seven children ... four boys and three girls. And 16 people, 12 children and four adults, are in hospital.

'The terrorist has been arrested. He's a 19-year-old who was officially registered as a gun owner.'

It was possible the toll would rise. Twenty-one wounded people were rushed to hospital, including 18 children, six of whom were in intensive care.

Vladimir Putin ordered an urgent review of gun control laws in the country where shotguns, semi-automatic rifles and handguns are legal.

The president was 'taking into account the weapon' used in the attack, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters, though he did not specify which type of gun that was.

Crowds of anxious parents gathered outside the school this morning, some were seen weeping as children were loaded into ambulances while others watched on as firefighters helped children clamber down ladders.

One pupil said that they were ordered to lock their classroom doors by the headteacher over the loudspeaker system before they heard shooting erupt.

He said he saw a cleaner and a guard who had been shot while trying to prevent the gunmen from gaining access to the school were more than 700 children and 52 teachers were at work.

The youngster told local media: 'We were sitting on the third floor, we had a history lesson.

'Suddenly, in the middle of the lesson, the headmistress starts shouting into the loud speaker so that no one would open their doors.

'The class teacher quickly closed the door and literally five seconds later a big explosion went off, either on the first or on the second floor.

'We stayed together and did not open the door to anyone, but they burst into it - shots were heard, banging on the door, as if someone was trying to knock it out.

'After some time, we heard the riot police and the the deputy head shouted to us to open it.

'Firefighters came in and took us out.

'I don't know who did the shooting, and nobody knows.

'Some say they are terrorists, others say that they are eleventh graders.

'I don't know who they killed, but they killed the cleaner and the guard for sure - they tried to keep them out of the school.'

A 15-year-old boy told local media: 'Everyone started panicking and saying 'shut the doors.' About a minute later the headteacher started yelling: 'We're shutting the doors!'

'We got out about 15 minutes later, not out of the windows. I wanted to do that, but the teacher closed the window immediately and said no.'

Galyaviev, who left the school four years ago, is reported to have killed seven eighth graders - aged 13 to 14 - and a teacher.

He left two unexploded devices inside the school building and reportedly told officers he left another device planted in his house.

The apartment block has since been evacuated so that the bomb squad can make checks.

In a chilling message posted online before the attack, he wrote: 'Today I will kill a big amount of bio trash and will shoot myself.'

Photos from his social media accounts showed Galyaviev wearing a mask emblazoned with the word: 'God.'

Other messages read: 'As god, I want everyone to admit they are my slaves.

'You have to do absolutely everything that I want. I want each of you to kill 10+ and kill themselves. There should be no one living, this is the universe's mistake.'

He also wrote: 'I came to this world as a human to get rid of all of you.'

Reports say he told police that he learned how to make bombs on the Internet.

He also said that 'he hates everybody', and 'wanted everybody to know he is a god.'

His shocked father Rinat when found by the media said: 'What has he done?'

He was later detained.

Reached by phone he said: 'I am at the police station right now, don't bother me please.'

An Irish questioner asks how much worse things are going to get in Ukraine, and if “the no to the no fly zone is set in stone completely or would you consider it if this conflict does become a massacre? “And just to follow up – Was it naive of you and of course the Europeans to trust in Putin for diplomacy?” “I think the terrible expectation is that the suffering we’ve already seen is likely to get worse before it gets better,” Blinken says. With regard to the no fly zone, Blinken cites Jens Stoltenberg, the Nato general secretary, in saying that Nato has a responsibility to “ensure the war doesn’t spill over beyond Ukraine”. Shooting down Russian planes could lead to a full-fledged war in Europe, Blinken says. “President Biden has been clear that we are not going to get into a war with Russia. But we are going to tremendous lengths with allies and partners to provide Ukrainians with the means to to effectively defend themselves. And of course, we’re seeing every single day, their extraordinary heroism as well as very, very real results in in what they’re doing to achieve that.” About potential naivety, Blinken says the US was “the opposite of naive” and had warned for months that Putin was planning “an aggression of Ukraine”, and was prepared either way.

4 Mar 2022 21.35 GMT Martin Pengelly And we finally have a statement from Donald Trump about Bill Barr, his second attorney general and the author of a book, out next week but extensively trailed, in which he says his former boss was unfit to be president and still will be if he chooses to run again. In Trump’s words, Barr… … wouldn’t know voter fraud if it was staring him in the face – and it was. The fact is, he was weak, ineffective, and totally scared of being impeached, which the Democrats were constantly threatening to do. They ‘broke’ him. He should have acted much faster on the Mueller Report, instead of allowing the fake Russia, Russia, Russia, Hoax to linger for so long, but it was the Election Fraud and Irregularities that he refused to act on because he wanted to save his own hide – and he did. He never got impeached, contempt charges never went forward, and the Democrats were very happy with him – but I wasn’t. In Barr’s words – and to be fair, the words of many others – Trump’s lie about election fraud was just that, a lie. Barr resigned on 14 December 2020, at a meeting at which Trump gave him a bogus report about supposed fraud in Antrim county, Michigan, which he kept pushing on subordinates after that, as his attempt to overturn the election ran on and up to the January 6 riot at the US Capitol.

4 Mar 2022 20.00 GMT White House press secretary Jen Psaki fielded a question about Lindsey Graham and his comments calling for the assassination of Vladimir Putin. “That is not the position of the United States government that is certainly not the statement you would hear coming from the mouth of anybody working in this administration,” she said. When pressed further on the topic – on whether Joe Biden agreed with Graham that Putin’s death was the only way out of this war – Psaki staunchly doubled down. “The president believes there continues to be a diplomatic path forward,” she said. “President Putin has the ability to deescalate. We have left the door open for months now to engage in deescalation.”

Psaki continued: “We are not advocating for killing the leader of a foreign country or a regime change. That is not the policy of the United States.” Read more about the outcry against Graham’s comments here: Outcry after US senator Lindsey Graham suggests Putin’s assassination Read more Share Updated at 22.22 GMT

The US embassy in Ukraine called the attack on the nuclear plant a war crime.

Blinken says the US is looking at what can be delivered to Ukraine for it to defend itself, every day. On conclusions about Russian military strength, Blinken says he doesn’t want to draw any yet. What we do know, he says, is “how extraordinary the Ukrainian people are. Their will, their determination, their absolute commitment to defend their country, to defend their freedom, to defend their future. “That’s the story of the past week and it’s an incredibly powerful one.” And with that, he’s gone.

4 Mar 2022 19.28 GMT Martin Pengelly Blinken is asked if energy sanctions on Russia are being considered. “As a general proposition, nothing is off the table,” he says, adding that minimising harm to the US and partners and allies is also part of implementing sanctions, which means the US wants to avoid raising prices at the pumps at home. “We have a strong interest in degrading Russia status as a leading energy supplier. Over time, this would be a profound strategic shift. That’s why Nord Stream two was shut down. “That’s why we’re surging [liquid natural gas] to Europe right now, to help accelerate its diversification away from Russian gas. It’s why we’re denying critical technologies to Russia for further energy exploration … this is part of a process to reduce reliance, dependence on Russian energy.” Blinken is asked how many more people have to die before energy sanctions are used but he avoids a direct answer, of course.

4 Mar 2022 19.25 GMT 'Suffering likely to get worse before it gets better' - Blinken Martin Pengelly Secretary of state Antony Blinken has just issued a fresh warning about the war, echoing other leaders of late who have warned that the worst is ahead. An Irish questioner asks how much worse things are going to get in Ukraine, and if “the no to the no fly zone is set in stone completely or would you consider it if this conflict does become a massacre? “And just to follow up – Was it naive of you and of course the Europeans to trust in Putin for diplomacy?” “I think the terrible expectation is that the suffering we’ve already seen is likely to get worse before it gets better,” Blinken says. With regard to the no fly zone, Blinken cites Jens Stoltenberg, the Nato general secretary, in saying that Nato has a responsibility to “ensure the war doesn’t spill over beyond Ukraine”. Shooting down Russian planes could lead to a full-fledged war in Europe, Blinken says. “President Biden has been clear that we are not going to get into a war with Russia. But we are going to tremendous lengths with allies and partners to provide Ukrainians with the means to to effectively defend themselves. And of course, we’re seeing every single day, their extraordinary heroism as well as very, very real results in in what they’re doing to achieve that.” About potential naivety, Blinken says the US was “the opposite of naive” and had warned for months that Putin was planning “an aggression of Ukraine”, and was prepared either way.

The International Workers' Day protests on May 1 typically attract thousands of people across Europe, but many events have been cancelled or banned this year because of the pandemic.

Greece urged unions to delay their protests by a week, but hundreds of students and workers nonetheless gathered outside the country's parliament in Athens today - keeping their distance and wearing masks.

Police in Paris were arresting wildcat demonstrators after the usual May 1 events were cancelled because of the virus, with unions encouraging people to chant from their windows and balconies instead.

In Berlin, the usual left-wing protesters have vowed to observe social distancing, but others are plotting a 'hygiene demo' which typically attracts conspiracy theorists and anti-vaxxers who scorn the lockdown.

GERMANY: People holding flags and placards keep their distance at a protest on Berlin's Alexanderplatz today. Authorities fear there are more unruly protests to come

Greek workers and students wore masks and gloves as they lined up outside the parliament in Athens today, waving flags and holding placards for International Workers' Day.

Using colourful plastic markers placed on the ground to help them observe the safety distance, hundreds of protesters joined a rally organised by the Communist-affiliated group PAME.

The protesters waved flags, chanted slogans and held banners reading 'No sacrifice for the bosses'.

Meanwhile, Portugal's main CGTP trade union confederation is planning a gathering of union leaders on the vast esplanade where their traditional May Day parade ends each year.

The group said they would stand four metres (13ft) from each other and waved flags and placards.

In Finland, labour rallies are traditionally preceded by huge communal picnics in the largest public gathering of the year.

But only a handful of revellers congregated around the Manta statue in the market square, the traditional epicentre of the festival that was this year boarded up and patrolled by police enforcing the ban on groupings of more than ten people.

Authorities have instead encouraged Finns to celebrate online this year, with several restaurants across the capital offering live streams of wine tastings or cocktail lessons.

Berlin is set to deploy 5,000 police officers to enforce the lockdown rules amid fears that the protests will cause a surge in infections.

The city's interior minister Andreas Geisel said this week that 'May 1 must not become another Ischgl', referring to an Austrian ski resort which became a hotbed of infections earlier this year.

'I don't want demonstrations to lead to health dangers... the police will be firmly implementing the rules,' he warned.

The city's radical left groups, whose demonstration is usually the focal point of May 1 festivities, have changed their strategy this year to avoid the risk of infection.

Although they have promised to 'flood the streets with anti-racist, anti-patriarchal and anti-capitalist content', the organisers have also urged demonstrators to keep their distance from one another and cover their nose and mouth.

'We take the protective measures seriously... and will act responsibly,' they said in an online statement.

However, protesters at the 'hygiene demos' in Berlin and around the country may not take such precautions. Extremists from left and right have attended the rallies and declared a 'democratic resistance' to the lockdown.

The 'democratic resistance' has been gathering at Berlin's Rosa Luxemburg Platz since the end of March in a weekly rally against the lockdown.

The protesters, who include anti-vaccine conspiracy theorists, claim that the restrictions are an illegal attempt to curtail civil liberties by an authoritarian state.

Organisers play down the dangers of coronavirus, which has killed nearly 6,500 people in Germany, and call for an end to the restrictions.

Their last demonstration on April 25 saw around 100 people arrested for ignoring a ban on public gatherings. More than 500 people attended the protest.

Some charged that Chancellor Angela Merkel had imposed a 'ban on living', while others raged against the 'pharmaceutical lobby' and the Bill Gates Foundation, which runs vaccination campaigns in Africa.

Anti-Semitic blogger Nikolai Nerling was also present, while other protesters wore T-shirts claiming 'Rockefeller and Rothschild' had 'invented the coronavirus'.

The protesters have been assembling in front of Berlin's Volksbuehne theatre, prompting a furious reaction from director Klaus Doerr, who has dismissed them as a 'provocateurs and veritable liars'.

Polls show extremely limited support for such positions. A recent Kantar poll showed that 74 per cent of Germans were in favour of the restrictions.

One YouGov poll even found that 49 per cent of Germans believed the lockdown was being lifted too quickly.

Yet the uncertainty surrounding the coronavirus has led to a boom in conspiracy theories on social media, according to the Amadeu-Antonio anti-racism foundation.

The number of people joining conspiracy theory groups on the messaging app Telegram has 'exploded', foundation member Miro Dittrich said.

Common conspiracy theory topics included vaccines, contactless payment and 5G masts, he said.

'People are currently isolated from their social circles and are spending a lot of time online,' he added, which could help 'fuel belief in conspiracy theories'.

Germany yesterday announced plans to re-open churches, playgrounds and museums, but delayed a decision on hotels and restaurants. Some shops and schools have already re-opened.

Politicians have warned that Germany would have to re-impose lockdown measures if the rate of infection rises again when restrictions are eased.

The closely-watched rate of transmission (R) briefly rose back to 1.0 this week before falling again. It is currently at 0.76.

Germany's new infection count has risen for the last four days, reaching 1,639 today to take the total from 159,119 to 160,758.

The death toll rose by 193, bringing the overall tally from 6,288 to 6,481. Experts warn that the easing of the lockdown will take time to show its effects.

Elsewhere, Italy is also struggling to maintain order after some regions lost patience with the central government and began opening bars and restaurants ahead of schedule.

Prime minister Giuseppe Conte said the rogue loosenings were 'illegitimate' after Veneto and Calabria both moved ahead of schedule.

'We cannot allow the efforts made to be in vain because of rashness at this delicate stage,' Conte raged.

'Moving from the policy of 'let's close everything' to 'let's reopen everything', would risk irreversibly compromising these efforts,' he said.

Italy has been under lockdown longer than any other European country, since March 9, but measures are due to start being lifted next week.

In Spain, prime minister Pedro Sanchez has laid out a four-step plan to end the lockdown, beginning with some bars and restaurants on May 11.

Schools will start to re-open on May 18, while all shops will open with limited capacity in stage three before travel restrictions are lifted in stage four.

However, Spanish media says Sanchez is facing a battle to get his plan through parliament.

Anderson warned of Donald Trump supporters in the military while calling them a threat from within, and advised them to stop listening to 'The Pillow Guy' - Trump ally and MyPillow CEO Mike Lindell.

Gen. Anderson, who spoke to CNN about the upcoming 2024 elections and the threat of another possible insurrection, called Lindell a major source of misinformation while adding that Trump supporters must get educated on civics and political discourse.

'There's a threat within,' the retired general told the network.

'We've got some people that just haven’t been educated. They haven't been found out, and they've grown in power, through perhaps inaction on the parts of some of our key leaders.'

'What we can do now, identify those people, get them out of our ranks, and train the rest of the force on civics 101, about how our country is supposed to work, how elections work,' he said.

'Stop listening to the pillow guy and start learning about our country and how it's actually supposed to run.'

Lindell - or 'The Pillow Guy' as he's now known, has become quite the outspoken conservative political activist and conspiracy theorist in recent years.

He as propagated a number of 2020 election-related conspiracies, oftentimes stoking the political flames after the January 6 attack on the US Capitol, when the Proud Boys, a group of radical alt-right Trump supporters, stormed the US Capitol.

Meanwhile, Trump is seeking to have the court dismiss a lawsuit against him by eight Capitol Hill cops who accused him of sparking the January 6th MAGA riot, the Daily Mail reported on Tuesday.

The former president had addressed his supporters, many of whom believe Trump was cheated out of his reelection campaign during the 2020 presidential elections, at a rally outside of the White House on the morning of the riot.

Many of them later marched on the Capitol and forced their way inside the building. The House of Representatives impeached Trump for his role but the Senate acquitted him.

But Trump argues he isn't 'vicariously liable' for the actions of people who heard him speak at a 'Stop the Steal' rally before the riot, Bloomberg News reported.

'Speakers at political rallies do not owe a duty of care to members of Congress or Capitol Police Officers not at the rally,' Trump's lawyer Jesse Binnall said in the Dec. 24 filing in federal court in Washington.

Trump continues to falsely claim he won the 2020 presidential election instead of Joe Biden. The lawsuit from the officers, who were at the Capitol on the day of the riot, is one of many he is facing for his role

Lindell reportedly spent $25 million to push false pro-Trump election claims, saying 'I will spend whatever it takes' to get the former president back in office, according to a December 16 CNBC report.

The show's host, Pamela Brown, asked Gen. Anderson to discus his concerns on the 'partisan divide' that has been plaguing US politics since the election of Trump back in 2016.

'Really quickly, just walk us through your concern about this partisan divide and how it could impact the chain of command, and why that is so concerning to you in terms of preventing another coup attempt potentially in 2024,' asked Brown.

The retired general cited Trump's cult-like personality, which developed a legion of loyal followers who have since proven to follow the former president 'like a king,' Anderson said.

'Well, the big problem here is allegiance to the Constitution, versus allegiance to a leader. Or in this case, a cult-like figure like Trump,' said Anderson.

'There's a lot of people in uniform that are confused about that. They think the president is something like a king, and it’s not.'

'You know, we swore an oath to the Constitution. That's how our soldiers, sailors, airmen, and Marines need to act.'

'And you know we're concerned that there's so much activity within the military that shows that people are ignorant of what our Constitution is really all about, and they have responded to people like Trump, and when he tells them to jump, they're probably willing to do that.'

Anderson has since voiced his criticisms of Trump and his concerns of an insurrection or 'civil war' in 2024, when midterm elections are set to take place.

He graduated from the US Military Academy in 1978 and served as a Platoon Leader before working his way up to the rank of Brigadier General.

In 2006, Anderson served as the Director of Multi-National Forces in Iraq. His military career ended in 2008 while working at the Pentagon.

There were scenes of mayhem with 'horrific acts of violence' as activists brawled openly in the grounds of UCLA deep into the night with fireworks hurled into crowds and objects thrown before police intervened.

The fighting erupted just hours after cops in New York dramatically raided halls at Columbia University in New York City and arrested 300 pro-Palestine protesters who had occupied the building.

Mayor Eric Adams blamed the majority of the trouble at the Ivy League college on outside agitators.

'There is a movement to radicalize young people, and I'm not going to wait until it's done and all of a sudden acknowledge the existence of it,' he added.

'This is a global problem that young people are being influenced by those who are professionals at radicalizing our children and I'm not going to allow that to happen as the mayor of the city of New York.'

At the same time as the altercations were taking place in California, a protester on the campus of the University of Arizona was struck in the head with a rubber bullet as four people were arrested with cops using 'non lethal chemical munitions.'

In New Orleans, state police and local police worked in tandem to disperse a crowd of protesters on Tulane University's campus.

That resulted in six arrests and the suspension of seven students. An investigation has been launched into whether or not faculty were actively in the protests. Meanwhile, group of protesters ransacked a library in Portland State University, also on Tuesday.

These incidents unfolded amid a deepening national crisis with dozens of universities around the United States struggling to contain similar protests.

In UCLA last night protesters and counter-protesters were seen clashing with sticks, and tearing down metal barricades, TV footage showed. Others were seen launching fireworks or hurling objects at each other in the dark - lit up with laser pointers and bright flashlights.

The Los Angeles police department said that 'officers have been deployed, and are currently on the UCLA campus, to assist in restoring order.'

The nationwide protests have posed a challenge to university administrators trying to balance free speech rights with complaints that the rallies have veered into anti-Semitism and hate.

The unrest has swept through US higher education institutions like wildfire, with many student protesters erecting tent encampments on campuses from coast to coast.

In another of the newest clashes, at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, police moved in Tuesday to clear one encampment, detaining some protesters in a tense showdown.

A week-long occupation was brought also brought to an end at northern California's Cal Poly Humboldt while Portland State University's campus, in Oregon, was closed Tuesday 'due to an ongoing incident' in the library.

Local media reported around 50 protesters had broken into the building a day earlier.

And Brown University reached an agreement in which student protesters will remove their encampment in exchange for the institution holding a vote on divesting from Israel - a major concession from an elite American university.

Shocking footage from the scene at UCLA showed both sides openly clashing as college security abandoned the scene and local police were nowhere to be seen.

Just before 11pm local time in Los Angeles, the violence escalated when the pro-Israeli side surrounded the pro-Palestine group. During this standoff, a firework was thrown at the camp.

The video showed both sides using pieces of wood as makeshift weapons. The walls of the encampment were smashed, at least one person could be seen being dragged on the ground by another group.

'Horrific acts of violence occurred at the encampment tonight, and we immediately called law enforcement for mutual aid support,' UCLA's vice-chancellor Mary Osako said in a tweet.

The LAPD said in a message that their presence was requested on campus at UCLA due to 'multiple acts of violence.'

These clashes lasted for around 90 minutes before Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass announced that law enforcement was about to be deployed at the college. At 1:30am local time police officers and the California Highway Patrol arrived.

TEXAS: This was the scene earlier this week in Austin when state troopers pepper sprayed pro-Palestinian protesters at the University of Texas

The Oct. 7 attack on southern Israel by Hamas militants from Gaza, and the ensuing Israeli offensive on the Palestinian enclave, have unleashed the biggest outpouring of U.S. student activism since the anti-racism protests of 2020.

This week alone has seen police at the University of Texas in Austin, Tulane University in New Orleans, the University of North Carolina and the University of Connecticut forcibly remove pro-Palestine protest encampments.

At Columbia University, the NYPD will remain at the scene until May 17 to prevent further encampments from being created.

Just blocks away from Columbia, at The City College of New York, demonstrators were in a standoff with police outside the public college´s main gate.

Video posted on social media by news reporters on the scene late Tuesday showed officers putting some people to the ground and shoving others as they cleared people from the street and sidewalks. Many detained protesters were driven away on city buses.

After police arrived, officers lowered a Palestinian flag atop the City College flagpole, balled it up and tossed it to the ground before raising an American flag.

Brown University, another member of the Ivy League, reached an agreement Tuesday with protesters on its Rhode Island campus.

Demonstrators said they would close their encampment in exchange for administrators taking a vote to consider divestment from Israel in October.

The compromise appeared to mark the first time a U.S. college has agreed to vote on divestment in the wake of the protests.

Columbia's police action happened on the 56th anniversary of a similar move to quash an occupation of Hamilton Hall by students protesting racism and the Vietnam War.

The police department earlier Tuesday said officers wouldn't enter the grounds without the college administration´s request or an imminent emergency.

Now, law enforcement will be there through May 17, the end of the university's commencement events.

In a letter to senior NYPD officials, Columbia President Minouche Shafik said the administration made the request that police remove protesters from the occupied building and a nearby tent encampment 'with the utmost regret.'

Shafik also referenced the idea, first put forward by New York City Mayor Eric Adams earlier in the day, that the group that occupied Hamilton was 'led by individuals who are not affiliated with the university.'

Neither provided specific evidence to back up that contention, which was disputed by protest organizers and participants.

NYPD officials made similar claims about 'outside agitators' during the huge, grassroots demonstrations against racial injustice that erupted across the city after the death of George Floyd in 2020.

Columbia President Minouche Shafik called in the NYPD in to 'restore order and safety' to the campus amid the escalating protests which also included a massive encampment at the school

Cops were armed with zip ties and pepper spray as they stormed the campus at around 9.3-pm on Tuesday

In some instances, top police officials falsely labeled peaceful marches organized by well-known neighborhood activists as the work of violent extremists.

Before officers arrived at Columbia, the White House condemned the standoffs there and at California State Polytechnic University, Humboldt, where protesters had occupied two buildings for more than a week until officers with batons intervened early Tuesday and arrested 25 people.

President Joe Biden believes students occupying an academic building is 'absolutely the wrong approach,' said National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby.

Later, former President Donald Trump called into Sean Hannity´s show on Fox News Channel to comment on Columbia´s turmoil as live footage of police clearing Hamilton Hall aired. Trump praised the officers.

'But it should never have gotten to this,' he told Hannity.

The nationwide campus protests began at Columbia in response to Israel´s offensive in Gaza after Hamas launched a deadly attack on southern Israel on Oct. 7.

Militants killed about 1,200 people, most of them civilians, and took roughly 250 hostages. Vowing to stamp out Hamas, Israel has killed more than 34,000 Palestinians in the Gaza Strip, according to the local health ministry.

As cease-fire negotiations appeared to gain steam, it wasn´t clear whether those talks would inspire an easing of protests.

Israel and its supporters have branded the university protests as anti-Semitic, while Israel´s critics say it uses those allegations to silence opposition.

Although some protesters have been caught on camera making anti-Semitic remarks or violent threats, organizers of the protests, some of whom are Jewish, say it is a peaceful movement aimed at defending Palestinian rights and protesting the war.

On Columbia´s campus, protesters first set up a tent encampment almost two weeks ago. The school sent in police to clear the tents the following day, arresting more than 100 people, only for the students to return.

Negotiations between the protesters and the college came to a standstill in recent days, and the school set a deadline for the activists to abandon the tent encampment Monday afternoon or be suspended.

She told her colleagues of the need for the probe in a President's Day letter days after the Senate voted to acquit President Donald Trump of 'incitement of insurrection.'

'It is clear from his findings and from the impeachment trial that we must get to the truth of how this happened,' she wrote.

She said the outside commission was needed 'to protect our security, our security, our security'.

With impeachment now behind the Senate, the only looks back at the riot during the counting of the electoral votes are an internal security review she ordered and federal prosecutors who are rounding up individual rioters, charging some small groups with conspiracy.

House Republicans are pushing Pelosi on the need for a continuing National Guard presence in Washington, D.C more than a month after the riot.

Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) says an independent Sept. 11th-style commission will probe the Jan. 6th Capitol riot

And Wisconsin Sen. Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, one of 43 Republican senators voting not to convict Trump, said the riot 'didn't seem like an armed insurrection to me.'

He told WISN radio: 'The group of people that supported Trump, the hundreds of thousands of people who attended those Trump rallies, those are the people that love this country. They never would have done what happened on January 6. That is a group of people that love freedom; that’s a group of people we need to unify and keep on our side.'

Rep. Lisa McClain, a member of the House Armed Services Committee, wants Pelosi to brief lawmakers on the lingering security presence, which has been estimated to cost nearly $500 million.

The force rose in size to 26,000 National Guard forces in the days after the January 6 riot and leading up to the inauguration, amid what top homeland officials said was a rise in the threat assessment amid ongoing risks.

A contingent of 5,000 troops is expected to remain until mid-March.

'Myself and several of my colleagues have asked Nancy Pelosi for a briefing as to why do we need these troops here, and we have received zero information, zero,' said McClain in an appearance on Fox & Friends Monday.

She hit Pelosi for failing to provide lawmakers with more information. She called it 'extremely concerning' that troops could be in the region through the fall.

'Just tell me why. I feel like there's a boogeyman under my bed,' she told the network. 'Just explain to us why we have the National Guard troops,' she said.

Pelosi says the independent commission will probe the Jan. 6th riot

To protect our security, our security, our security, our next step will be to establish an outside, independent 9/11-type Commission' to probe the riot, she said

Thousands of National Guard forces fortified the Capitol after the riot

President Trump was acquitted on 'incitement of insurrection'

'Just tell me why. I feel like there's a boogeyman under my bed,' said Rep. Lisa McClain (R-Michigan), who is demanding Pelosi provide a justification for the ongoing presence of National Guard troops

'It's amazing to me that she can do this without any disclosure, without any information and just continue to spend money with no briefing,' she said, adding: 'I would rather put those National Guard men and women to help my constituents in my state help with the distribution of the COVID relief vaccination.'

Her complaints came a day after the Senate voted to acquit President Donald Trump of 'incitement of insurrection,' in a trial in which Democratic managers played jarring footage of the MAGA mob rampaging the Capitol. Some members of the mob were even shown talking about doing harm to Pelosi herself, while others were shown chanting 'hang Mike Pence!'

Among the issues raised by House managers was why guard forces were not immediately deployed after the breach. The MAGA rioters breached the Capitol while Congress was meeting to count the electoral votes making Joe Biden president.

Pelosi referenced Capitol security in a President's Day letter to colleagues, where she again called for a probe of the events of Jan. 6. She has implemented other measures, positioning magnetometers outside the House chamber and establishing fines for lawmakers who refuse to go through them, after several GOP members refused to honor the rules.

'Now, as always, security is the order of the day: the security of our country, the security of our Capitol which is the temple of our democracy, and the security of our Members,' Pelosi wrote.

She referenced an internal security review being overseen by retired Gen. Russel Honoré about the riot and its aftermath.

'It is clear from his findings and from the impeachment trial that we must get to the truth of how this happened. To protect our security, our security, our security, our next step will be to establish an outside, independent 9/11-type Commission to 'investigate and report on the facts and causes relating to the January 6, 2021 domestic terrorist attack upon the United States Capitol Complex… and relating to the interference with the peaceful transfer of power, including facts and causes relating to the preparedness and response of the United States Capitol Police and other Federal, State, and local law enforcement in the National Capitol Region,'' she wrote.

'As we prepare for the Commission, it is also clear from General Honoré's interim reporting that we must put forth a supplemental appropriation to provide for the safety of Members and the security of the Capitol,' she said, without putting a price tag on it.

Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) also called for the return of Guard forces. 'The National Guard answered the call at a critical time but its mission is now complete. It's time to reopen the Capitol grounds to the American people​,' Cotton wrote in an op-ed. 'It's time to send home the troops.​'​​","Republican lawmakers push Nancy Pelosi for removal of 5,000 National Guard troops protecting D.C.",1

Locals in Finsbury Park, north London, said this morning they feared their rent would 'skyrocket' after the elusive street artist's latest piece appeared on the side of a building.

But estate agent Alex Georgiou, who bought the property in 2012 for £400,000 according to land registry records, looked to allay neighbours' fears by claiming he wouldn't be charging more off the back of the area's overnight fame.

However, he welcomed interest from potential buyers, as he bullishly told MailOnline: 'You know what, if somebody offered me millions and they can have the building and take the flats with it. Feel free.'

The block, which he estimates is worth around £1.3m today and now consists of three flats, has been the subject of huge activity since the piece was spotted late on Sunday night.

Mr Georgiou, 40, ran down to see if for the first time this morning and said the addition had created a 'buzz' around the building.

The artwork shows a splattering of green which has been painted behind a bare tree to look like foliage, with a stencil of a person holding what appears to be a pressure hose next to it

'It's quite mad to be honest, to come down here and just to see all the crowds of people looking at the building,' he said.

When Banksy officially announced the artwork was his on Monday morning, locals in the area began to worry rents could rise.

But when asked about the possibility of tenants being charged more, Mr Georgiou said: 'No, no, no, no.

'I was having a bit of a laugh with the girls who were saying I was gonna put the rent up 250 per cent but no no. I doubt it.

'Unless we have a massive Banksy fan who is prepared to pay over the odds. But a property is worth what a property is worth.

'You know what, if somebody offered me millions and they can have the building and take the flats with it. Feel free.

'They can come knocking if they want. Give me a number in an envelope and whoever has the biggest number can have it.

'How do you protect it, you know? It is on the side of a building, and it's such a big thing. It's not like his normal stuff where it's quite small. This is the whole size of the building.

'The question is, what do I do with it now? What am I meant to do with it now? I definitely plan on keeping it on there and letting people enjoy it, everyone's loving it which is great, I just can't really believe it still to be honest,' he said.

Mr Georgiou founded local estate agent Alex Marks with his brother Anthony in 2009

Banksy officially confirmed the painting was his at 11.13am on Instagram

The building is split into three flats which are all currently being rented out

When asked about the current worth of the building, Mr Georgiou estimated it would go for around £1.3million in the current market.

Mr Georgiou founded local estate agent Alex Marks with his brother Anthony in 2009.

The brothers were raised in the local area and hope the Banksy will help improve it.

The artwork in Finsbury Park shows a splattering of green paint behind a bare tree to resemble foliage, with a stencil of a person holding a pressure hose depicted next to it.

Some residents said they were 'proud and delighted' at the thought of the anonymous artist choosing their street for his latest mural when it emerged on Sunday after being painted overnight.

But James Roebuck, 26, who lives in the block, said: 'Banksy came overnight and now my rent will skyrocket.'

Banksy - Britain's most famous street artist - is renowned for choosing homes at random to use for his artwork, often shooting up their value by millions.

Banksy artworks in the past have greatly increased the price of buildings

Crowds have been decending on the area to see the Banksy for themselves

It can lead to problems though, with the owner of one building in Shoreditch painting over one of the artist's etchings after they became irritated by a security light constantly being activated by Banksy fans turning up to view it.

Meanwhile, homeowners Garry and Gokean Coutts spent £200,000 removing a mural of a seagull from their house in Lowestoft, Suffolk, when they were forced to hire security after it became a target for vandals and thieves.

One Banksy artwork that appeared in London in December - a traffic stop sign covered with three military drones - was stolen less than an hour after appearing on a street in Peckham.

Banksy, who has 12.3million followers on Instagram, always confirms an artwork is his by posting a picture of it.

This came for the Finsbury Park painting at 11.13am today.

Prior to the official announcement, the artwork had already been gathering fans at the site on Hornsey Road in north London.

Former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said he was 'delighted' to see the artwork in his Islington North constituency.

'Banksy's come to Finsbury Park with a bit of greenery in a place that needs a bit more greenery. We're the most densely populated constituency in the country and I'm just delighted,' the MP said.

'It gives the idea that we could do with much more greenery everywhere and I think that's a really nice message.'

James Peak, who created the BBC Radio 4 series The Banksy Story, rushed to the scene yesterday after receiving a tip-off.

Prior to the announcement he was already sure it was a Banksy.

Mr Peak said the artwork had the hallmarks of a Banksy due to its clear message that nature is struggling and it is up to us to get it back.

He said another clue was the fact it was done with minimum effort but still looked really cool.

Banksy's eye for detail could also be on display as the colour of the paint matches the one used for street signs by Islington Council.

The lack of leaves, despite it being spring, could also have inspired Banksy to create the painting.

Pictures from the scene one year ago, in March 2023, showed the tree looking similarly bare with no greenery.

But in July 2022 the tree was pictured with a lot more green foliage.

It is understood that the cherry tree in front of the artwork is around 40 to 50-years-old and in declining health. The council's tree service had been maintaining it for some time to help prolong its lifespan and would continue to try to keep the decaying tree alive.

The artwork's appearance has delighted many residents of Islington who took to social media to celebrate.

Wanja Sellers, a Hornsey Road resident who lives a few doors down from the mural, said: 'We're so proud and delighted that Banksy chose our road and chose Finsbury Park for his work.

'The bright green colours represent Islington, which is lovely, and also, of course, St Patrick's Day, which is nice and festive.

'Choosing the colours of our borough just makes it feel like a personal message to us residents. We just feel so proud.'

Councillor Roulin Khondoker, executive member for equalities, culture and inclusion, said in a statement to PA: 'Culture is a powerful way to tell meaningful stories and we welcome this artwork in Islington, a borough that celebrates creativity.

'This fantastic piece from Banksy has sparked a real buzz across Islington and beyond, and we very much want the artwork to stay for people to enjoy. We want to find more ways that we can tell important stories through art and culture.

'Trees are a vital part of our work to tackle the climate emergency. We've planted nearly 900 in the last year alone, and we work hard to care for our trees and help them to thrive.'

Lidia Guerra, another Hornsey Road resident, said: 'The way it's been done, with the paint spraying down, reminds me of a weeping willow, so there's perhaps a message about the struggle of nature with the dead tree in front.

'It's just great - when we read about it last night, we knew we had to come and see it as soon as possible.

'We feel so proud to think he chose our street.'

Chris Beskin, another resident of Hornsey Road, said he welcomes the mural, saying it is a 'great thing to have in our area'.

'I'm absolutely delighted to see this on our street - I think it's great and sends a strong message, I'd like to see more of it, to be honest, the more the merrier,' he said.

'I think it's probably one of his biggest pieces in a while - and the fact he's done it on the wall means it can't just be stolen or easily removed.'

Mr Beskin went to see the mural with his neighbours on Monday morning.

Fellow resident Carolyn said: 'It's just lovely to see how this piece of art has brought everyone together.

'People have come out to chat in the streets and came out early this morning to speculate together.

'It's brought the community together, which has been really nice to see.'

One social media user was left puzzled after the artist seemed to have left zip ties at the scene

Paul Drinot wrote on social media: 'If this is a Banksy, it's the best thing that's happened to the Hornsey Road in years.'

One social media user was left puzzled after the artist seemed to have left zip ties at the scene - posting a picture of several black ones in a bunch.

The last time Banksy's art was revealed in London, it ended in scandal.

Two men were arrested and bailed for allegedly using bolt cutters to steal the artwork which pictured a stop sign featuring three military drones.

Once Banksy announced on social media the artwork belonged to him in an Instagram post shortly after midday on December 23, two men allegedly appeared at the scene and cut down the artwork before running off.

Police have yet to recover the piece of art, but one gallery owner told the BBC at the time it could be worth up to £500,000.

Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Mr Peak said Banksy's incorporation of the tree into his Islington artwork would make it impossible to steal.

He said: 'I don't think anyone is going to be able to nick this... how are you going to steal a tree?'

This Banksy was painted on the side of an office building in Holywell Row, Shoreditch, in 2006 but was painted over by the owner after they grew annoyed at art lovers turning up to see it

The stop sign artwork was widely interpreted by followers of the artist as calling for a ceasefire in the Gaza Strip.

The Instagram revelation led to a stream of locals descending on the site and taking photos of the installation on their phones.

But at around 12.30pm, the peaceful scene was shattered by the arrival of two men, one of whom balanced precariously on an Lime e-bike while hurriedly hacking the sign down with bolt cutters.

Banksy did not comment on the drama of the theft, but had been warned by a social media user: 'The sign will be snatched pronto.'

Pieces by the rogue artist have previously been sold for millions of pounds.

The drones on the piece resembled those on another artwork, Civilian Drone Strike, which depicted them destroying a house while a little girl and her dog watch on in horror.

It was sold for £200,000 to raise funds in opposition to a London arms fair.

Banksy's most famous works: His identity remains cloaked in mystery, his work the subject of endless speculation and his art a major tourist attraction. Since the 1990s Banksy has dominated the street graffiti with his well known satirical installations of humorous images usually paired with anti-war or anti-capitalist slogans. The so called 'Banksy effect' has seen people buy up his work for small fortunes. His Love Is in the Bin was sold in London in 2021 for a staggering £18.6million - a record for one of his pieces. But his art has also been the target of several council campaigns to clean up graffiti and paint over the murals, sparking outrage from his many fans.

https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-9582085/Liz-Cheney-claims-Republicans-voted-against-impeaching-Trump-afraid-lives.html,1,"Liz Cheney has claimed some Republicans voted against impeaching Donald Trump because they were 'afraid for their lives' as she admitted she regrets voting for him in the 2020 election and warned he poses an 'ongoing danger' to America.

Cheney told CNN's Jake Tapper Friday that several GOP members of Congress told her they feared for their safety in the lead-up to February's vote to impeach Trump for inciting the January 6 Capitol riot.

The Wyoming Representative said she believes some fell in line with the wider party because of these concerns and insisted more lawmakers were in favor of his impeachment 'than are willing to say so'.

Cheney was ousted from her role as House Republican leader this week amid a backlash from staunch Trump allies.

The ex-number three in the party was one of just 10 House Republicans who voted to impeach Trump for his role in the violent insurrection. Since then, she has been a vocal critic of the former president and his efforts to overturn the result of the presidential election.

Liz Cheney told CNN Friday (above) some Republicans voted against impeaching Donald Trump because they were 'afraid for their lives' as she admitted she regrets voting for him in the 2020 election and warned he poses an 'ongoing danger' to America

'I think you have more members who believe in substance and policy and ideals than are willing to say so,' Cheney told CNN.

'If you look at the vote to impeach, for example, there were members who told me that they were afraid for their own security - afraid, in some instances, for their lives.

'And that tells you something about where we are as a country, that members of Congress aren't able to cast votes, or feel that they can't, because of their own security.'

Trump was acquitted in the Senate in a vote of 57-43 with just 10 Republicans crossing party lines and voting to convict.

Trump had pushed false election fraud claims since he lost the election to Joe Biden and, on the morning of the riot, held a 'Stop the Steal' rally where he told his supporters to 'fight.'

Cheney called Trump an 'ongoing danger' to the nation as she said we have to 'get to the bottom of what happened in 2020.'

'I think that people have been lied to,' she said.

'I think that it's really important for all of us to get to the bottom of what happened in 2020, what happened on January 6 and to go forward looking toward truth.'

She said she felt she had an 'obligation' to speak out against Trump's false election fraud claims and warned that 'we've had a collapse of truth in this country.'

'We've seen an evolution of, you know, a general situation where conspiracy theories are rampant, where good people in a lot of instances have been misled and believe things that are not true,' said Cheney.

Cheney speaks to the media after she was removed of her leadership role as Conference Chair Wednesday

'And so, I think that we all have an obligation to make sure we're doing everything we can to convey the truth, to stand for the truth and to stand for the Constitution and our obligations.'

She added: 'There's an ongoing danger and we've got to continue to stand up against it.'

Cheney went on to say that 'we have to save the Republican party' and hit out at people coming to Washington to be 'social media stars.'

Congress didn't used to 'have the vitriol flying back and forth that we certainly have over the last several years,' she said.

'People ought to want to be there and work hard and not be social media stars. That's not the right reason to be there,' she said.

Cheney did not cite any names however her opponent Trump was known to tweet copious amounts every day - until he was banned from Twitter, Facebook and other platforms for spreading misinformation.

Cheney was ousted from her position as the number three leader of the Republican party Wednesday during a closed-door meeting.

The Wyoming Representative said she believes some GOP members didn't impeach Trump as 'they were afraid for their lives'. Cheney was one of just 10 House Republicans who voted to impeach Trump (impeachment trial pictured above)

Republicans had earlier tried to remove her back in February.

Cheney has been one of the few members of the GOP to speak out against Trump and his pursuit to overthrow the election.

Trump continues to claim the election was 'stolen' from him despite dozens of lawsuits, state investigations and even his own Justice Department concluding that there was no evidence of widespread fraud.

Cheney has repeatedly referred to Trump's claims as his 'big lie' and blamed him for the Capitol riot, where a MAGA mob stormed the building in an effort to stop the election being certified for Joe Biden.

The congresswoman told ABC News Friday she regretted voting for Trump in the 2020 election but, as a Republican, 'was never going to' vote for the Democratic party.

'I was never going to support Joe Biden and I do regret the vote,' she said.

'It was a vote based on policy, based on substance and in terms of the kinds of policies he put forward that were good for the country.

'But I think it's fair to say that I regret the vote.'

She compared Trump and his false election fraud claims to the actions of the Chinese Communist Party.

'Frankly, it's the same kinds of things that the Chinese Communist Party says about democracy: that it's a failed system, and America is a failed nation,' Cheney said.

The Republican congresswoman told ABC News Friday she regretted voting for Trump in the 2020 election but 'was never going to vote for Joe Biden'

'I won't be part of that. And I think it's very important for Republicans who won't be part of that to stand up and speak out.'

While she has faced a backlash for speaking out against Trump, Cheney called on House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy - who has not condemned the former president - to testify about the events of January 6 in any commission that arises.

'I think that he very clearly and said publicly that he's got information about the president's state of mind that day,' Cheney said.

Rep. Jamie Herrera Beutler previously revealed he was present when McCarthy spoke to Trump on the phone during the riot.

He said McCarthy begged the president to call off his supporters.

Trump is said to have responded to the House Minority Leader - who was hiding from the violent mob at the time - ''Well, Kevin, I guess these people are more upset about the election then you are.''

Cheney said she 'wouldn't be surprised if [McCarthy] were subpoenaed' but that she hoped it wouldn't be necessary to get him to testify.

Staunch Trump ally New York Rep. Elise Stefanik was elected Cheney's replacement this week. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy and Stefanik Friday

New York Rep. Elise Stefanik was elected Friday as Cheney's replacement winning 134 to 46 of the vote.

Stefanik is a staunch Trump ally and opposed the certification of the electoral college votes in favor of Joe Biden back in January.

She has supported Trump's false claims of election fraud as well as conspiracy theories about votes in Arizona. Trump had also backed Stefanik to take on the role.

Cheney hit out at her successor calling it a 'dangerous' move to elect someone who has supported Trump's false claims.

'I think it's dangerous. I think that we have to recognize how quickly things can unravel,' she said.

'We have to recognize what it means for the nation to have a former president who has not conceded and who continues to suggest that our electoral system cannot function, cannot do the will of the people.'",Liz Cheney claims Republicans voted against impeaching Trump as they were 'afraid for their lives',1

22 Nov 2024 10.06 GMT At the time, with Australia on top, Nathan Lyon’s spell of 5-1-23-0 seemed like a minor detail. Now it feels like a waste of 23 precious runs. Australia aren’t out of this but they surely need Alex Carey to get them to at least 100. It’s hard to make sense of it all after such a dramatic day. It’s worth stressing that the pitch wasn’t dangerous or uneven. The ball zinged through, as it always should in Perth. When you couple that with some extravagant sideways movement, particularly when India bowled, it’s no surprise that 17 wickets fell. Share Updated at 10.13 GMT

22 Nov 2024 09.57 GMT That was a chastening final session for Australia. It felt like they were in complete control after dismissing India for 150, but you know what they say: you should never judge a pitch until Jasprit Bumrah has bowled on it. He ran riot with the new ball, taking three quick wickets including Steve Smith for a golden duck, and returned to take another just before the close. Mohammed Siraj and the debutant Harshit Rana bowled superbly. But Bumrah was off the charts. We talk all the time about a great captain’s innings; that was one of the great captain’s spells. Share

22 Nov 2024 09.54 GMT Stumps: Australia trail by 83 27th over: Australia 67-7 (Carey 19, Starc 6) Starc drives Bumrah handsomely over mid-off for four, then almost falls to the last ball of an amazing day. He was duped by a slower ball that hit high on the bat and looped short of Bumrah in his follow through. Share

22 Nov 2024 09.49 GMT 26th over: Australia 62-7 (Carey 18, Starc 2) A quiet over from Rana, his last of an impressive first day in Test cricket. Figures of 8-1-33-1 are a bit unflattering. Time for one more from Bumrah before the close. “Just on Malcolm Marshall, I was a 12-year-old boy who was taken to the MCC Bicentenary Match in 1987 (all the way from Belfast) and saw the short second innings of the ROWXI,” writes Hugh Odling-Smee. “Sitting pitch side on, I saw Marshall clean bowl Gavaskar, who had hit 188 in the first innings. I have never seen anything more exciting in all my years of watching sport. Marshall’s speed, the stumps flying, Gavaskar’s reaction and the huge collective joy that erupted in the stands was overwhelming and I’ll never forget it.” Share

22 Nov 2024 09.41 GMT WICKET! Australia 59-7 (Cummins c Pant b Bumrah 3) Bumrah wasn’t done after all; he just needed a change of ends. Cummins is drawn towards a length awayswinger and gets a little touch through to Rishabh Pant. The extraordinary Jasprit Bumrah has taken 4 for 12. Share

22 Nov 2024 09.37 GMT 24th over: Australia 57-6 (Carey 17, Cummins 1) Harshit Rana replaces Bumrah, whose two-over spell lacked the rhythm and menace of his first. Carey, who has been looking to counter-attack from the start, hits consecutive boundaries with a flick to fine leg and a deft uppercut. If he’s style there in the morning this game could change quickly. “I’m about to do battle with my new coffee machine (bear with me on this) so I’ll have to read the instructions yet again,” says Gary Naylor. “Unless I put my glasses on, not only can I not read the words, I’m not sure I could tell you their language. I’m a lot older than Virat Kohli and Steve Smith, but I’m not sure (looking at the dropped catch and the first ball miss) that their eyes aren’t on their way to wherever mine have gone.” You realise they’ll both play five Tests against England in the next 14 months? If they go on to score 800 runs apiece I’m putting your home address and telephone number on every internet forum. Share

22 Nov 2024 09.32 GMT 23rd over: Australia 48-6 (Carey 9, Cummins 0) New Zealand’s 3-0 win in India looks even better now. It also highlights the folly of preparing bunsens when you have a pace attack like this. Carey is beaten three times during a superb over from Siraj, twice on the drive and once trying an uppercut. The daft thing is Australia are 48 for 6 yet the ball must have beaten the bat at least a dozen times, probably nearer two dozen. Share

22 Nov 2024 09.28 GMT 22nd over: Australia 48-6 (Carey 9, Cummins 0) Carey has started confidently in the circumstances, although he has a bit of luck when he inside-edges a drive onto the pad off Bumrah. “No Dennis Lillee in the best ever Test XI?” says Laurence Boyd. “Who’s your spinner? SK Warne?” Warne, yeah. I’d have McGrath because nobody has ever been as good against the opposition’s best player. Before the World XI sets off for Mars he’d proudly announce which of their top order he was targeting. Share

22 Nov 2024 09.24 GMT 21st over: Australia 47-6 (Carey 8, Cummins 0) We’ve focussed on Bumrah’s genius, understandably enough, but Siraj and Rana have also bowled marvellously. “Regarding your choice of pace attack,” says Krishnamoorthy V, “I would replace Malcolm Marshall with Michael Holding – the other two are spot on.” Macko was the greatest IMO. His Cricinfo profile, written by our old friend Mike Selvey, captures his greatness perfectly. Share

22 Nov 2024 09.23 GMT WICKET! Australia 47-6 (Labuschagne LBW b Sirah 2) Mohammed Siraj puts Marnus Labuschagne out of his misery with a very full delivery that hits him below the knee roll in front of the stumps. Labuschagne’s reviews, just in case, but deep down he knows. He’s gone for 2 from 52 balls and Australia are enduring the evening session from hell. Share

22 Nov 2024 09.19 GMT 20th over: Australia 42-5 (Labuschagne 2, Carey 3) Bumrah’s back! There’s still around 35 minutes to play so this could be the game right here. Bumrah’s first over is a maiden to Labuschagne, who played it pretty well. It helped that there wasn’t as much sideways movement as in Bumrah’s electrifying first spell. “As an Englishman living in New Zealand I followed the recent Black Caps tour of India closely,” says Jon Saunders. “Winning 3-0 in India has to be one of the most astonishing series results of all time and hasn’t get anywhere near as much credit as it should do. If England or Australia did that we wouldn’t hear the end of it. Nobody saw it coming at all, least of all the Kiwis!” I can’t recall a more unlikely series win, certainly not a more unlikely whitewash. Share

22 Nov 2024 09.14 GMT 19th over: Australia 42-5 (Labuschagne 2, Carey 3) “Wasim over Waqar???” queries David Brook. Left-arm, better batter, was great for longer. At their absolute peak I might pick Waqar though. Share

22 Nov 2024 09.08 GMT 18th over: Australia 42-5 (Labuschagne 2, Carey 3) Rana, who is an abundant unit, has words with Labuschagne after going past his edge once again. That was a serious delivery: just full of good, straightening off the seam. The precision of India’s bowling, at a time when it would have been natural to chase wickets, has been exemplary. A single takes Labuschagne to 2 from 41 balls of the fiercest concentration (what’s the batting equivalent of hard yakka?); Carey mocks him by driving his third ball through extra cover for three. Share

22 Nov 2024 09.03 GMT 17th over: Australia 38-5 (Labuschagne 1, Carey 0) The opening day of a marquee series rarely produces numbers like this: 66.5 overs, 188 runs, 15 wickets. “Bumrah always makes me think of under-14 cricket, when one kid is so much better than the others that the coach actually has to stop him batting or bowling sometimes to give the other kids a go,” says Pete Salmon. “They always had figures of something like six for nine of eight overs, and then had to retire at 30 not out off about 11 balls. I assume all Test cricketers are that kid.” If he does this for another 3-4 years and finishes with, say, 300 wickets at 20, I think he’ll be a contender for an all-time World XI. At the moment my pace attack would probably be Malcolm Marshall, Wasim Akram and Glenn McGrath, but his average is superior to all of them. Share

22 Nov 2024 09.02 GMT WICKET! Australia 38-5 (Marsh c Rahul b Siraj 6) Australia are now officially in all sorts. Marsh fenced at a good delivery from Siraj that lifted and straightened to take the edge. Rahul swooped low to his left at third slip – it wouldn’t have carried to second – and took a superb catch. Share

22 Nov 2024 09.01 GMT There’s no soft signal and I wouldn’t want to be the third umpire right now. My instinct is that Rahul got his fingers under the ball at third slip, but I definitely wouldn’t put the farm on it. Share

22 Nov 2024 09.00 GMT Has Marsh been caught by KL Rahul? It looks good but they’re going upstairs. Share

22 Nov 2024 08.57 GMT 16th over: Australia 38-4 (Labuschagne 1, Marsh 6) Marsh has started well and, as usual, looks comfortable against pace and bounce. It’s sideways movement that will trouble him, and he needs a thick inside-edge to keep out a good nipbacker from Rana. It might have been going over anyway. Later in the over Rana collects the ball in his followthrough and flings it back towards Labuschagne. He blocks it with his bat, at which point the entire Indian team appeal for something or other. It wasn’t a big appeal and was almost certainly designed to affect Labuschagne’s concentration. Share

22 Nov 2024 08.51 GMT 15th over: Australia 37-4 (Labuschagne 1, Marsh 5) Australia know from the Indian innings that batting will get easier as the ball gets older. The tough part is managing to hang around until that happens. Labuschagne has been dragged into a desperate fight for survival, which almost ends when he leaves a ball that whooshes just past off stump. I think it was ultimately a good leave, though I wouldn’t put the farm on it. Another maiden from Siraj. Labuschagne has 1 from 36 balls, Marsh 5 from 10. Share

22 Nov 2024 08.43 GMT 14th over: Australia 37-4 (Labuschagne 1, Marsh 5) Rana overpitches to Marsh, who pumps him through mid-off for four. That’s a lovely shot, full of authority. Marsh averages around 160 in Tests on this ground, though batting will never have been more challenging than it is right now. Rana, who hits the pitch really hard, beats Marsh twice with excellent lifting deliveries. India keep finding players. Rana is 22 and making his Test debut after only 10 first-class games; he looks totally at home. Share Updated at 08.50 GMT

22 Nov 2024 08.39 GMT 13th over: Australia 33-4 (Labuschagne 1, Marsh 1) Bumrah gives way to Siraj after a spectacular spell 0f 6-3-9-3. There are still 75 minutes remaining so Bumrah should be back before the close. Siraj has words with Labuschagne over something and nothing, then finds the inside-edge with a sharpl delivery. It flies past off stump and through to the keeper. Labuschagne is living exceedingly dangerously. “People want this series to replicate the 2005 Ashes,” wr ites Digvijay Yadav. “Well, the visiting team has been rolled over. And the best fast bowler in the world has snapped back. (Probably no bigger compliment for both Bumrah and McGrath to be compared to the other.) I hope this lives up. Could make this the greatest rivalry in the world.” It already is, surely. Share

22 Nov 2024 08.34 GMT 12th over: Australia 33-4 (Labuschagne 1, Marsh 1) Mitch Marsh, who loves batting in Perth and is a very good player of pace, takes a single off Rana to get off the mark from his first ball. Labuschagne does likewise to get off the mark from his 24th ball, prompting banterous cheers from the crowd. Mark Waugh points out that, while that was a jaffa from Rana, Head was stuck on the crease when he needed to get forward. Had he done so he’d probably have survived via a thick edge. “A warming good morning to you (I’ve got the heater full on),” says John Starbuck. “The problems with playing every Test in Perth are (a) Australia would be the permanent hosts (b) no chance of anything like a sticky dog so almost no spin and (c) we here in the UK would have to be out of bed too early.” All very good points. BUT LOOK AT THIS CRICKET. Share

22 Nov 2024 08.30 GMT WICKET! Australia 31-4 (Head b Rana 11) Harshit Rana first Test wicket is the big one! Travis Head has been cleaned up by a devastating delivery from around the wicket: fullish and straightening off the seam to beat Head’s crabby defensive push. This is utterly exhilarating. Share Updated at 08.30 GMT

22 Nov 2024 08.27 GMT 11th over: Australia 31-3 (Labuschagne 0, Head 11) Head has a fast-handed flash at Bumrah and connects only with fresh air. That aside he plays the over pretty well and steals a quick single off the fifth ball. Head is such a big wicket because he can change both the state and the mood of the game in half an hour, as India know from bitter experience. “Oh, the joys of test cricket,” says Phil Withall. “Time at hand, 450 overs to slowly absorb the intricacies of bat and ball, savouring the growing tension as pressure mounts and time recedes. Time for the mind to drift, for conversation and banalities. It also has a perverse way of mutating into absolute chaos, either way I am, and always will be in love with it.” Share

22 Nov 2024 08.23 GMT 10th over: Australia 30-3 (Labuschagne 0, Head 10) Travis Head starts the counter-attack with two superb boundaries off Rana, a slashing back cut and a deliberate uppercut that bounces this far short of the boundary sponge. How long this lasts, who knows, but his fearlessness is so impressive. He’s like the Tyler Durden of batting; everyone wants to bat the way he does but only he has the courage to consistently counter-attack when the heat is on. “Labuschagne is receiving the sort of searching examination that would normally require an MRI scanner and X-ray machine followed by the dread sound of a rubber glove being donned,” says Brian Withington. “Just saying.” And nobody can have you banged up for that. Actually they can, but let’s not worry about that for now. Share

22 Nov 2024 08.17 GMT 9th over: Australia 20-3 (Labuschagne 0, Head 1) Head takes a single off Bumrah’s first ball, the old Geoffrey Boycott tactic. Labuschagne, who has already been hit on the body multiple times, is smacked in the ribs by a malevolent nipbacker. But he survives another over, 0 from 20 balls now; he knows Bumrah can’t bowl forever. Share

22 Nov 2024 08.12 GMT 8th over: Australia 19-3 (Labuschagne 0, Head 0) The hulking debutant Harshit Rana replaces Siraj, who bowled a pretty good spell of 3-1-12-0 that was totally overshadowed by the genius at the other end. He gets some extravagant swing from the first ball and twice hits Labuschagne in or around the box. A brilliant first over ends with a lifter past the edge. Labuschagne has faced 15 balls without getting off the mark; survival is enough of a challenge right now. Share

22 Nov 2024 08.07 GMT 7th over: Australia 19-3 (Labuschagne 0, Head 0) The hat-trick ball is full, straight and would have trapped Head LBW but for a vital inside-edge. A double-wicket maiden from Bumrah, who has stunning figures of 4-2-7-3. They flatter him not one jot. Share

22 Nov 2024 08.05 GMT Smith skipped towards the off side and was pinned plumb in front by another huge nipbacker. It was so plumb that Smith barely discussed a review; replays show it would have hit the middle of middle. The astonishing Jasprit Bumrah is on a hat-trick. Share Updated at 08.06 GMT

The Department of Defense (DoD) released a report on November 30 revealing it has investigated 183 instances of extremism within the military, including 78 cases of troops 'advocating for, engaging in, or supporting the overthrow of the U.S. Government'.

But experts have told DailyMail.com that the figures were likely to be a significant underestimate, pointing to a 2020 Military Times poll that showed a third of active service members had witnessed signs of white nationalism or racism among their fellow troops.

Historians highlighted a litany of alarming cases in which both current and former Army members have plotted to assassinate political leaders, bomb media organizations and topple the Government.

Many have never materialized, but those that do often have deadly consequences due to the military training of the perpetrators.

Travis Owens was an active duty U.S. Marine when he was investigated by the FBI for allegedly plotting to assassinate members of the Democratic National Committee. Owens was never charged but the case led to his removal from the military

Former Marine Liam Collins, 24, pleaded guilty on a charge connected to a neo-Nazi plot to attack US energy infrastructure, hatched over three years at a military camp in North Carolina

Heidi Beirich, co-founder of the Global Project Against Hate and Extremism, accused the Pentagon of not doing enough to root out extremists within its ranks.

'If the military doesn't take this seriously, it means terrorist attacks will be more violent, more successful,' she told DailyMail.com.

'This is a poison for the rest of American society. If we don't rip these people out, they're deadly.'

In a 2019 New York Times report, Carter F. Smith, who served as an Army criminal investigator for 30 years before joining the faculty of Middle Tennessee State University, was quoted as saying that the military does not make this issue a priority.

'They always say the numbers are small, and because of that, it is not a priority,' Smith said. 'Well, the numbers might be small, but they are like a drop of cyanide in your drink. They can do a lot of damage.'

The Pentagon report comes amid a series of alarming trends of extremism within the military.

Over the past decade a murderous Neo-Nazi group has been founded by a former soldier, a growing number of plots to attack critical infrastructure in the U.S. have been hatched by current and former servicemen, while 18 percent of those charged in connection with the Capitol siege in 2021 have military backgrounds.

In the wake of the January 6 riots, The Pentagon admitted it did not know how to deal with the problem of extremism within its ranks and ordered a military-wide pause to allow commanders a window to tackle the issue.

Matt Dallek, a political historian at The George Washington University in Washington, DC, pointed out that radicalization has been a long standing concern within the US military.

The most infamous example being Timothy McVeigh, the former U.S. Army soldier behind the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing that left 168 people dead and injured nearly 700.

More recently, a former active-duty Marine and member of the Army Guard was sentenced to 13 years in prison in 2020 after he was accused of plotting a terrorist massacre of journalists and Democrats including Nancy Pelosi.

Coast Guard Lieutenant Christopher Hasson was found to have held violently racist views even before he joined the military, raising questions over vetting procedures.

The Base has been described by extremism watchdogs as a neo-Nazi group that conducts military-style training, with its members tied to plots that have targeted U.S. critical infrastructure with the aim of hastening the end of society

Christopher Hasson, 54, a former active-duty Marine, was sentenced to 13 years in prison in 2020 after he was accused of plotting a terrorist massacre of journalists and Democrats including Nancy Pelosi

Physical attacks on the US power grid rose by 71 percent last year, according to data from the Electricity Information Sharing and Analysis Center (E-ISAC). Some of these plots have been concocted by members of the military

But Dallek, author of 'Birchers: How the John Birch Society Radicalized the American Right', said it was hard to tell whether a disproportionate number of servicemen held extremist beliefs due to a lack of data, but warned the issue was particularly concerning due to its potentially fatal fallout.

'There is a clear threat in people who are experts in weaponry, who have access to advanced knowledge about how to make bombs, who also have a radical view of the world that impels them to commit violence,' he said. 'That can be a pretty dangerous recipe.'

Beirich agreed that attitudes within the military tended to reflect a rise in white nationalism in wider society.

But she said there appeared to be a 'disconnect' between the DoD's report and the Military Times survey, which she believes indicates a far higher number of military personnel are 'involved in extremist activities'.

Beirich said there was a long history of white supremacist groups encouraging their members to join the military so they could learn how to 'blow things up and be better with weapons', while also spreading their hateful ideologies.

These infiltrators are known as 'ghost skinheads' due to their removal of neo-Nazi tattoos before they enter service.

There are also concerns that younger service members can be susceptible to new ideas disseminated by those in leadership positions.

For example, in 2019, Army Reserve lieutenant colonel Christopher Cummins distributed flyers for the extremist group Identity Evropa in Tennessee and Mississippi, while Army private Christpher Hodgman did the same in Brighton, New York, according to an investigation by HuffPost.

Beirich also highlighted a growing number of recent cases in which current and former servicemen have targeted critical power stations in the U.S. with guns and explosives as part of neo-Nazi terror groups.

Earlier this year, DailyMail.com revealed security chiefs were increasingly concerned by a rise in ballistic threats on its energy sector this year, with previous attacks resulting in entire counties losing power for days.

In October, a former Marine pleaded guilty on a charge connected to a neo-Nazi plot to attack US energy infrastructure, hatched over three years at a military camp in North Carolina.

Liam Collins, 24, was accused of stealing military gear and delivering them to co-conspirators who planned to use them for assaults on power stations.

His conviction comes after a Department of Homeland Security (DHS) threat assessment published last month warned that domestic terrorists have 'increasingly called for physical attacks on critical infrastructure this year' in the belief that they 'would have cascading impacts on US industries and the American way of life'.

The growing threat from the far right is attributed to the growth of 'accelerationism' - an 'ideology that seeks to destabilize society and trigger a race war', according to the DHS.

Indeed, a report published by The George Washington University in September last year noted the number of white supremacist plots targeting energy systems had 'dramatically increased' since 2016.

The neo-Nazi group founded by former soldier

Her co-conspirator, Brandon Russell, 28, of Florida, is a founder of the neo-Nazi group Atomwaffen Division (AWD) and has a long history of plots to attack US infrastructure, according to a criminal complaint filed against him

Sarah Beth Clendaniel, 27, of Maryland, was arrested for her part in an alleged neo-Nazi plot to 'completely destroy' the power grid in the predominantly black city of Baltimore, according to a criminal complaint filed in Maryland

The American Al-Qaeda stuffed with military men The Base, a sister organization to the Atomwaffen (AWD), derives its name from the English translation of Al-Qaeda. Since 2018, it has built a coalition of white supremacist members within the U.S. and abroad through online chat rooms, in-person meetings, propaganda, and military-style training, according to the Department Of Justice. Its social media accounts repeatedly post content promoting terrorism, lone-wolf attacks, and a white ethno-state. In March 2021, it was revealed that former Marine Ryan Burchfield, 23, from Virginia, was deported from Ukraine for his alleged affiliation to the group, according to VICE News. He told other members of The Base in an encrypted chat room that 'we're going to make Atomwaffen look like boy scouts', according to VICE News. Atomwaffen had reportedly already been implicated in five murders in the US at the time. In January 2019, three members of The Base, including ex-Canadian Armed Forces reservist Patrik Jordan Mathews, allegedly hatched a plot to 'kick off the economic collapse' of the US by taking out critical infrastructure across the country', according to court filings.

Founded by a former National Guard soldier who had a picture of fellow veteran and Oklahoma bomber Timothy McVeigh on his dresser, the neo-Nazi group Atomwaffen Division (AWD) has already been linked to several murders, bombings and plots in the U.S. and elsewhere.

It has also been a part of the growing trend of 'infrastructure terrorism', in which insurrectionists have targeted critical power stations around the country in a bid to bring an end to the American way of life.

Its founder, Brandon Russell, 28, formerly a private first class in the National Guard, was arrested in February this year over an alleged racist plot to 'completely destroy' the power grid in the predominantly black city of Baltimore, according to a criminal complaint filed in Maryland.

He stands accused of conspiring to inflict 'maximum harm' by shooting at five substations operated by Baltimore Gas and Electric (BGE), which serves 1.2 million customers in central Maryland.

He met his alleged co-conspirator, Sarah Beth Clendaniel, 27, of Maryland, while the pair were in jail.

They were caught in an FBI sting.

In 2018, Mr Russell was sentenced to prison after being convicted of explosives charges.

Mr Russell was released from prison in 2021, before his arrest over the Baltimore plot.

Ms Clendaniel had been serving a prison sentence for armed robbery when the pair met.

Atomwaffen members subscribe to a neo-Nazi version of 'accelerationist' philosophy - the idea that political goals can be achieved only via social collapse.

The group believes that modern society 'ought to be driven into apocalyptic collapse so a white ethnostate or whites-only utopia can be constructed in its wake', according to the Southern Poverty Law Center, which tracks extremist groups.

The Anti-Defamation League (ADL) describes it as a 'small neo-Nazi group whose ­members are preparing for a race war to combat what they consider the cultural and racial displacement of the white race'.

Atomwaffen or its offshoots have been banned in the UK, Canada and Australia.

Vasillios Pistolis, 24, was booted out of the military in 2018 after he was outed as a member of the group.

The former U.S. Marine Corps was one of the earliest members of AWD, having joined in 2017, a military probe found.

But his membership only became known following an investigation by ProPublica and Frontline into his online profile.

He left a conspicuous digital footprint of his involvement with extremist groups, but had no criminal background.

It sparked a debate over whether military chiefs could delve into recruits online history to root out extremist views without infringing on freedom of speech.

Marine Corps Recruiting Command said its the screening process for 'aberrant thinking and behavior' is a 'multi-layered' approach that involves police records checks, records of convictions and a signed statement and screening form that addresses gangs and racist or extremist organizations and activities.

The Naval Criminal Investigative Service launched a probe into Pistolis following the media reports of his neo-Nazi ties.

The investigation, obtained by Marine Corps Times, revealed the former marine started researching the 'Unite the Right' movement while in the Corps, before attending several rallies, including the bloody Charlottesville rally in 2017, which turned deadly when James Alex Fields Jr., 20, drove his car into counter protestors, killing Heather Heyer.

Vasillios Pistolis, 24, was booted out of the military after he was outed as a member of the AWD

Pistolis told military investigators that he was in Atomwaffen for less than a year and described himself as a 'nationalist', not a white supremacist.

He said the organization was a 'prepper group for the collapse of the U.S. government'.

Meanwhile, in October 2020, three alleged neo-Nazis were charged with a conspiracy to attack US energy infrastructure in a plot hatched at a military camp in North Carolina.

Liam Collins, Paul Kryscuk and Jordan Duncan researched a previous attack on power infrastructure, according to the charges.

For three years, between 2017 and 2020, Kryscuk manufactured guns and Collins, stationed at Camp Lejeune at the time, stole military gear and had them delivered to the other men, the indictment said.

Duncan allegedly gathered 'a library of information,' some military-owned, about weapons, toxins and explosives.

Video footage obtained shows the men shooting guns, wearing 'AtomWaffen-masks' while giving Nazi salutes, according to court documents.

Collins pled guilty this year to interstate transportation of an unregistered firearm, but not guilty to a charge of destruction of an energy facility.

Duncan is attempting to have his indictments dropped, arguing that they are unconstitutional.

Capitol riots reveal military's extremism problem

Larry Rendall Brock Jr, a retired Air Force lieutenant colonel and decorated combat veteran from Texas, was arrested after he was photographed wearing a helmet and body armor on the floor of the Senate during the storming of the Capitol

Brock was photographed during the deadly riot carrying plastic zip-tie handcuffs

Jacob Fracker Jr., 31, was serving in the Virginia National Guard at the time of the riots, but was placed on leave after an image posted to Facebook showed him participating in the siege

Fracker was reportedly accompanied to the riot by fellow Rocky Mount PD officer Thomas Robertson (left, and right with Fracker), 49, who is an Army veteran also facing charges

Around 18 per cent of the more than 1,000 people charged in connection with the Capitol attack, according to data from the University of Maryland and the Justice Department.

In comparison, about 7 percent of all American adults are veterans, U.S. Census Bureau data from 2018 shows.

Former Defense Secretary Jim Mattis has admitted that the numbers are 'a concern', but said those who participated in the siege 'don't define the military'.

He added that only a handful of those involved in the attack on the Capitol were still on active duty or reservists.

Several veterans have been charged with violent entry and disorderly conduct on Capitol grounds.

Among them is Larry Rendall Brock Jr., 55, an Air Force veteran from Texas, who was photographed donning a tactical helmet and vest while carrying flex cuffs inside the Capitol.

In a post to Facebook, Brock said he was gearing up for a 'Second Civil War' ahead of the riot, according to court documents.

The Air Force Academy graduate flew combat missions in Afghanistan and remained on active duty until 1998 before retiring from the Air Force Reserve in 2014, according to the service.

Brock was sentenced to two years in prison in March.

Some accused of laying siege to the Capitol were still serving in some capacity at the time.

Jacob Fracker Jr., 31, was serving in the Virginia National Guard at the time of the riots, but was placed on leave after an image posted to Facebook showed him and Army veteran Thomas Robertson, 49, participating in the siege.

Fracker pleaded guilty in March last year to a felony charge of conspiring with Robertson to obstruct Congress from certifying President Joe Biden's electoral victory.

He was sentenced to one year of probation, with prosecutors citing his cooperation in the investigation and his testimony against Robertson.

Robertson was convicted of attacking the Capitol to obstruct Congress from certifying the Electoral College vote and sentenced to seven years and three months in prison — matching the longest sentence so far among hundreds of Capitol riot cases — along with three years of supervised release.",US military infiltrated by white supremacists and insurrectionists as experts warn Pentagon report detailing 78 internal plots to overthrow the Government is just the tip of the iceberg,1

Meijer, a U.S. Army veteran who served in Iraq and as a conflict analyst in Afghanistan, voted to impeach President Trump after the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol and his latest broadside followed calls by some Trump supporters to secede from the United States.

'I struggle with Memorial Day,' he wrote in the first of string of tweets that criticized the 'holier than thous' deploying 'hot takes.'

'And then there are those who take this sacrifice for granted, waxing patriotic while salivating for civil war.

'Claiming they need to destroy the Republic in order to save it in the ultimate betrayal of oaths sworn. Those treacherous snakes can go straight to hell.'

Meijer was among those urging Republican Senators to back a 9/11-style commission to investigate the Jan. 6 violence.

Rep. Pete Meijer used a Memorial Day message to apparently unload on members of his own party, describing them as 'treacherous snakes' for claiming they had to 'destroy the Republic in order to save it

Meijer, who served in Iraq as a non-commissioned officer and as a conflict analyst in Afghanistan, hit out at people taking 'sacrifice for granted, waxing patriotic while salivating for civil war.'

He said rejection would set back the aim of healing party divisions.

'A lot of folks might dismiss [the inquiry] as a product of the swamp, as tainted in one way, shape or form, but it would be the closest we could get to something that may be factual, that may clear away some of the fantasies, some of the fictions surrounding January 6 and the events preceding it,' he told CNN last month.

In the wake of the attack, he said he was altering his routine and thinking about buying body armor for his protection.

'I have colleagues who are now traveling with armed escorts out of fear for their safety. Many of us are altering routines,' he told MSNBC at the time.

'I'm working to get body armor, which is a reimbursable purchase that we can make.'

His latest comments come amid continuing fall-out from Jan. 6 and as former President Trump continues to exert a tight hold over the party.

House Republicans dumped Liz Cheney out of her leadership position last month because of her continuing criticism of Trump.

In the aftermath of the Jan. 6 attack, Meijer said he had altered his daily routine and was looking into buying body armor for his protection

And for every attack by the likes of former House Speaker Paul Ryan - who last week said: 'If the conservative cause depends on the populist appeal of one personality, or on second-rate imitations, then we're not going anywhere' - there is a string of Trump loyalists ready to punch back.

But Meijer 33-year-old congressman from Grand Rapids, Michigan, may have been targeting someone close to home with his tweets.

Michigan Republican Party co-chair Meshawn Maddock played with the idea of Michigan seceding in a Facebook post that showed her posing for a photograph with Brexit leader Nigel Farage.

'Maybe it's time for a #MIexit,' she wrote, describing Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer - a favorite target of Trump supporters - as 'tyrannical.'",Michigan Republican Rep. Pete Meijer slams his OWN party for being 'treacherous snakes',1

The Prime Minister will use a Downing Street press conference to confirm the unlocking next Monday, with almost all legal restrictions to be axed in England.

But he will caution that the dramatic easing 'comes with a warning', and people must 'expect' to keep wearing masks in enclosed spaces such as supermarkets and trains.

Government experts have suggested working from home and social distancing should remain the norm after the shift to trusting the public's 'common sense'. There are fears that hospitalisations could hit 3,000 a day soon as the Delta variant continues to run riot.

Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham today renewed his assault over dropping the legal requirement to wear face coverings on public transport.

But health minister Edward Argar pointed to the 'defensive wall' being provided by vaccines. 'If not now, when?' he said of lifting the legal restrictions.

In a statement ahead of a Covid O meeting this morning to sign off the plans, and his press briefing at 5pm, the PM said that cases will inevitably continue to rise as restrictions are eased.

'Caution is absolutely vital, and we must all take responsibility so we don't undo our progress, ensuring we continue to protect our NHS,' he said.

Boris Johnson (pictured running this morning) will give the final go-ahead for 'Freedom Day' on July 19 later - but send a stark message that people need to keep being careful amid spiking cases

Boris Johnson will today warn that people should 'expect' to keep wearing masks in enclosed spaces such as supermarkets and trains even after Covid restrictions are lifted on July 19

Health minister Edward Argar pointed to the 'defensive wall' being provided by vaccines. 'If not now, when?' he said of lifting the legal restrictions

WHAT IS BEING AXED ON JULY 19? RULE OF SIX There will be no legal limits on social contact, meaning groups will not have to limit themselves to six people or two households if they are mixing indoors. Groups outdoors can be as large as people want them to be. WEDDING AND FUNERAL CAP The limits on attendance at weddings, funerals and other major life events are being scrapped. ART AND SPORT VENUE LIMITS There will be no more restrictions on the size of an audience at a concert or a show, or a crowd at a sports fixture, which means theatres and stadiums can run at full capacity. NIGHTCLUBS All other legal requirements for venues to close will be lifted, allowing night-time industries – including nightclubs – to reopen for the first time since the pandemic began. SINGING CURBS No restrictions on singing, or even guidance to restrict it. It means singing by church choirs can continue – as can karaoke nights. Advertisement

The latest Covid developments come as:

No 10 issued figures showing Covid vaccines have saved 30,000 lives and prevented 8.5million infections in England alone.

Dr Susan Hopkins of PHE warned that hospitalisations could soar to 4,000 a day by the end of the summer, the same level as at the peak in January.

Another 31,772 new Covid cases were recorded but there were signs the rate of growth is slowing and the 26 deaths recorded in the past 24 hours are a fraction of the toll seen at the peak of the pandemic.

The 'Freedom Day' was meant to herald a return to normality but the PM will also publish new 'guidance' setting out precautions people should continue to take.

Mr Johnson will say England is 'tantalisingly close to the final milestone in our road map out of lockdown, but the plan to restore our freedoms must come with a warning.'

He will insist that vaccinations have 'weakened' the link between Covid infections and hospital admissions, while warning 'the global pandemic is not over yet.'

However, the PM has dropped claims that the end of Covid restrictions is 'irreversible' following warnings from top scientists that easing restrictions could end in disaster.

Minister denies mixed messaging over masks as he says they COULD be compulsory on trains after July 19 A minister today denied there were mixed messages from the government over masks after July 19. Edward Argar insisted people could use their 'common sense judgment' in deciding whether to use face coverings. The comments came after Health Secretary Sajid Javid suggested it would be 'irresponsible' not to wear masks in crowded places. And 'Freedom Day' guidance being issued later is set to say they are 'expected' in some circumstances - although not legally required. Mr Argar raised fresh doubt about whether there will be a genuine removal of restrictions in a round of interviews this morning, saying train companies may well look at demanding them as a 'condition of carriage'. 'But at a governmental level, what we have set out, what we will be looking to do is see the legal requirements fall away but for guidance – strong guidance and cautious guidance – to be in place for people to exercise their common sense,' he added. Asked about former Tory leader Iain Duncan Smith complaining that the stance risks creating confusion, Mr Argar replied: 'I don't think that the British people will struggle to look at the guidance and form their own common-sense judgment – I don't think it will introduce confusion. 'I think people will look at it, they will form a sensible judgment based on the guidance.' Mr Argar said he personally would 'continue to carry my face mask in my jacket pocket'. 'The sort of circumstances where I would wear it, where I would encourage others to do so, are the sort of things that Chris Whitty, the chief medical officer set out a week or so again,' he told LBC. 'If, for example, you are in a crowded train, if you are in a setting like a hospital where the relevant authority requires you to wear it, or where, as common courtesy, if you are in an indoor environment with someone who clearly feels uncomfortable with you not wearing it, it would be common courtesy to put it on then – that's how I would behave.' Advertisement

In a round of interviews, Mr Argar said it is 'possible' that daily coronavirus case numbers could hit the 100,000 mark but stressed that vaccines are helping to protect people from serious illness and hospital admission.

Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, he said: 'You've seen the Secretary of State and others talk about between a range of 50,000 to 100,000 is possible.'

Mr Argar added: 'If you look at hospital admissions, and forgive me if my figures are a little bit out, but the seven-day rolling average of hospital admissions for now, when we're seeing this level of infection rate, is roughly between 350 and 400 a day.

'Back in January, with an equivalent infection rate, we were seeing 1,800 to 2,000.

'So you can see how that vaccine programme may not have broken it by 100 per cent because the vaccine isn't 100 per cent effective, but it has really severely weakened that link and therefore the numbers we are going to see in hospital are going to be much smaller.'

Mr Argar defended the decision to ditch mandatory masks in England, saying train companies may well look at demanding them as a 'condition of carriage'.

'But at a governmental level, what we have set out, what we will be looking to do is see the legal requirements fall away but for guidance – strong guidance and cautious guidance – to be in place for people to exercise their common sense.'

Asked about former Tory leader Iain Duncan Smith complaining that the stance risks creating confusion, Mr Argar replied: 'I don't think that the British people will struggle to look at the guidance and form their own common-sense judgment – I don't think it will introduce confusion.

'I think people will look at it, they will form a sensible judgment based on the guidance.'

Dr Hopkins yesterday called for people to continue following the advice beyond July 19.

'If you are able to do your business effectively from home then I think over the next four to six weeks, as there's a rise in cases, we should try our best to do that,' she told Times Radio.

'Then we should continue to look and see and have a cautious return to the office over the coming weeks, once we start to see a decline in the number of cases.'

Vaccines minister Nadhim Zahawi yesterday said there would now be a clear 'expectation' that people should continue to wear face masks in crowded indoor settings.

He added that it is 'important that we remain cautious', but insisted he is 'confident that we can proceed with this step forward' because 87 per cent of adults have now had a first vaccine dose.

Labour have warned that dropping laws requiring masks is a 'recipe for confusion' that risks potential confrontations between those with differing views on the matter.

But Mr Zahawi said vaccinations had 'severely weakened' the link between Covid infections and hospitalisations. He did, however, refuse to repeat Mr Johnson's assertion it had been 'severed.'

Last week, Mr Johnson said that mask wearing would become 'a personal choice' after July 19

The Prime Minister will use a Downing Street press conference this afternoon to confirm plans to end most Covid laws next Monday, despite surging cases

He added that Britons should 'do the right thing' in regards to face coverings, telling Times Radio: 'Indoors, in crowded carriages, the very clear guidelines will be that you're expected to wear a mask.'

Health Secretary Sajid Javid struck a harder line on masks in an interview with the Sunday Telegraph today, saying people would be 'irresponsible' not to wear one in a crowded space.

'If someone is not doing that, frankly, they're just being irresponsible, they're not playing their role as a responsible citizen,' he said.

Former Tory leader Sir Iain Duncan Smith last night accused ministers of 'losing their nerve' over the lifting of restrictions.

He said: 'This is not freedom at all. Ministers are being beaten up by the scientists in the media and they are beginning to wobble.

Vaccines minister Nadhim Zahawi yesterday said there would now be a clear 'expectation' that people should continue to wear face masks in crowded indoor settings

Britain has recorded 31,772 new cases of coronavirus and 26 new deaths in the latest government figures

'The question for the scientists is: do they believe the vaccines work?

'If they work – and they clearly do to reduce hospitalisations and deaths – then we should not be continuing to sacrifice the economy on the altar of some misguided zero Covid policy.'

CBI calls for self-isolation rules to be dropped earlier Business leaders have urged the government to drop self-isolation rules earlier than planned. The CBI, which represents 190,000 firms, said the requirement for the double-jabbed to quarantine after coming in contact with positive cases should go on July 19, rather than waiting until August 16. CBI boss Tony Danaker said: 'Learning to live and work with the virus is the right strategy, but we need to ensure this is a confident not an anxious transition, otherwise it won't work. 'Businesses have had a real boost this week with the Prime Minister's plans for the final stage of the reopening. 'What's needed now is a concerted effort between business and government to create widespread confidence from the get go.' Advertisement

While Steve Baker, deputy chairman of the Covid Recovery Group of lockdownsceptic Tory MPs, accused ministers of a 'shift in policy' and said that it was 'torturing the nation'.

Arguing that for some people wearing a mask is a 'terrible thing', he added: 'It's not fair snatching away people's hope, it's psychologically, profoundly destructive.'

Last week, Mr Johnson said that mask wearing would become 'a personal choice' after July 19.

Several senior ministers, including Chancellor Rishi Sunak and Environment Secretary George Eustice said they would be ditching their masks at the earliest opportunity.

But Mr Zahawi said yesterday: 'The guidelines that we'll set out tomorrow will demonstrate that, including guidelines that people are expected to wear masks in indoor enclosed spaces.'

He also suggested the government is looking at a test and release scheme to replace self-isolation for those who come into contact with a positive case, amid fears that millions of healthy people will be doomed to house arrest as infections rise.

'If you do test positive you have to and should rightly then self-isolate but it is important to look at that in a new context of this massive vaccination programme and make sure that it is fit for purpose for this new world,' he said.

Meanwhile, Sadiq Khan is still considering a bid to force passengers to keep wearing masks on trains, Tube and buses in London.

The level of nerves among the wider public was demonstrated today as research by Opinium found half would prefer the unlocking slated to happen a week tomorrow to be delayed.

Some 31 per cent thought the timing was about right, while just 10 per cent said it should have been earlier.

The PM is expected to give final approval for Stage 4 of the roadmap tomorrow, with almost all legal restrictions set to be lifted.

But Nicola Sturgeon has already vowed to keep masks and other curbs in Scotland for longer.

Research by Opinium found half would prefer the unlocking slated to happen a week tomorrow to be delayed

Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham has warned July 19 could turn into 'anxiety day', complaining that face coverings should remain a legal requirement.

He told the Observer: 'The government is simply wrong to frame everything from here as a matter of pure personal choice. It is not.

'Many people who are vulnerable to the virus have to use public transport and do their food shopping in person.

'That is why the wearing of face coverings in these settings should have remained mandatory.

'I will be strongly encouraging the people of Greater Manchester to continue to wear masks on public transport out of respect for others.'

Shadow health secretary Jon Ashworth said: 'Given Sajid Javid now considers it irresponsible to not wear masks then it would be equally irresponsible for his government to carry on with the plan to lift mask requirements while infections are heading to 100,000 a day.

'Reopening the economy must be done in a safe and sustainable way.

'That means continued mask wearing, support for increased ventilation standards in premises, decent sick pay, allowing people to continue working from home and ensuring all can access testing rather than introducing charges for lateral flow tests as Sajid Javid now proposes.'",Boris will push the button on July 19 'Freedom Day' TODAY,1
https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8523741/Emmanuel-Macron-wife-Brigitte-surrounded-anti-government-protesters-chanting-resign.html?ito=social-twitter_mailonline,1,"French president Emmanuel Macron and his wife Brigitte were at the centre of an astonishing security scare when furious anti-government swarmed towards them in a Paris park.

'Macron Resign' was the chant as the 42-year-old head of state and the first lady, who is 67, were approached in the Tuileries Garden, close to the Elysée Palace, where they live, on Tuesday afternoon.

They were walking hand in hand at the end of Bastille Day – the July 14 French national holiday, but this did not deter the demonstrators.

'The black beast – it's incredible,' said one, while others booed and swore openly while the disturbing scene was broadcast live on social media, including Twitter and Facebook.

As the couple's security guards tried to calm the situation, Mr Macron walked towards his tormentors and said 'Happy July 14' before trying to usher them away.

He was wearing a black leather jacket, with onlookers noting his resemblance to the Fonz, the character played by Henry Winkler in the American hitcom Happy Days who was obsessed with being 'cool'.

After a political argument started about police violence against Yellow Vests – the protest movement that has been active in France for almost two years – Mr Macron told the group to 'stay cool, and there will be no problems.'

'It's a public holiday and I'm going for a walk with my wife,' said Mr Macron, adding that the protestors are not 'models of respect', while he was.

One of the men then said: 'Mr President, I'm older than you. You are my employee, Mr. President. We are respectful, I did not show you disrespect, at least not today.

'Don't worry, I'm not going to hurt him. I don't even want to. I will hurt him with my vote in 2022'.

This is the year of the next presidential election, when Mr Macron's first five year term will end.

He then said Mr Macron was due 'to be fired,' while also calling for an end to the BRAV (Brigade of Repression of Violent Action) – a rapid reaction police motorbike unit set up last year to deal with rioters.

'It not the President of the Republic who does that!' Mr Macron retorts, telling the men not to shout, and to take their complaints to his new Interior Minister, Gérald Darmanin.

Nobody was arrested during the confrontation, and the Macrons were able to make their home to the presidential palace on foot, still surrounded by security guards.

Earlier in the day, Mr Macron had led the traditional Bastille Day celebrations, and also appeared live on TV saying that face masks will become compulsory in all enclosed public spaces in France from August 1 so as to try and prevent a second wave of Coronavirus.

https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8667265/Gunman-17-charged-Kenosha-fatal-shootings.html,1,"A 17-year-old has been arrested and charged over the shootings in Kenosha, Wisconsin that left two protesters dead and another injured in a possible vigilante attack during the third night of unrest in the city.

Kyle Rittenhouse was arrested on Wednesday afternoon in his hometown of Antioch, Illinois and charged with first degree intentional homicide. Court records say the teenager 'fled the state of Wisconsin with the intent to avoid prosecution for that offense'. Antioch is about 15 miles from Kenosha.

Two people were shot dead just before midnight on Tuesday - one in the head and one in the chest. One of the slain men has since been identified as Anthony Huber. A third man, a 36-year-old from West Allis, Wisconsin, was shot in the arm but his wounds were not believed to life-threatening.

The teenager's arrest came hours after video footage emerged showing Rittenhouse walking up to police with his hands in the air and his semi-automatic rifle slung across his body just moments after the shooting. He was apparently allowed to walk by despite members of the crowd yelling for him to be arrested because he had shot people, according to witness accounts and video footage.

Footage from earlier in the night appeared to show the teen guarding a local car shop with a group of armed militia members. Another video showed police thanking an armed group, of which the teenager appeared to be part of, and offering them water.

Rittenhouse was among the volunteers spotted earlier on Tuesday cleaning graffiti from a high school following another night of unrest in the city.

Much of Rittenhouse's Facebook is devoted to praising law enforcement, with references to Blue Lives Matter - the movement that supports police. He also can be seen holding an assault rifle in several photos.

He once participated in a youth public safety cadet program and a photo from that time showed him dressed in what appears to be a blue law enforcement uniform.

News of Rittenhouse's arrest came as President Trump said Wisconsin officials had accepted federal law enforcement support following several days of unrest across the city in the wake of the police shooting of black man Jacob Blake.

Kyle Rittenhouse was arrested on Wednesday afternoon in his hometown of Antioch, Illinois and charged with first degree intentional homicide over the shooting death of two protesters in Kenosha, Wisconsin last night. He will be extradited for a hearing on Friday in Wisconsin - where anyone 17 and over is treated as an adult

Rittenhouse was among the volunteers spotted earlier on Tuesday cleaning graffiti from a high school near the Kenosha County Courthouse following another night of unrest in the city

Anthony Huber has been identified as one of the men who was shot dead during the protests on Tuesday night

Witness accounts and video show that the shootings took place in two stages: The gunman first shot someone at a car lot, then jogged away, stumbled and fell in the street, and opened fire again as members of the crowd closed in him.

Police apparently then let the young man walk past them with a rifle over his shoulder with his hands in the air.

As for why the gunman was allowed to leave, Sheriff David Beth on Wednesday portrayed a chaotic, high-stress scene, with screaming, chanting, nonstop radio traffic and 'people running all over the place' - conditions that can cause 'tunnel vision' among law officers.

Rittenhouse, identified in court papers as a lifeguard at a YMCA in Lindenhurst, Illinois, was assigned a public defender in Illinois for a hearing on Friday upon his extradition to Wisconsin.

Under Wisconsin law, anyone 17 or older is treated as an adult in the criminal justice system.

Cellphone video showed the ordeal unfolded after a man was shot in the head outside a nearby auto garage. The videos showed the armed man running away in the moments after the gunshots rang out and he could be heard saying: 'I've just killed somebody'.

Onlookers were filmed desperately trying to put pressure on the injured man's head wound with a t-shirt as they yelled: 'We've got to keep him alive' and 'put pressure, put pressure.'

It is not yet clear what happened in the lead up to the initial shooting but police fear it may have stemmed from a conflict at a gas station between 'self-styled militias' defending local businesses from looters.

Separate videos that captured the other two shootings showed a group of protesters tailing the gunman as he ran down the middle of the street. Someone in the crowd can be heard asking 'What did he do?' and another responds that the man had shot someone.

The videos show the gunman stumbling and falling in the street before one pursuer took a flying kick at him, while another appeared to strike him with a skateboard.

The gunman fired three of four shots from a seated position, hitting at least two people, including one who fell over clutching his chest and another who stumbled away putting pressure on his arm, according to the videos.

As the crowd scattered, the shooter stood up and continued walking down the street as police cars arrived.

The man, who still had his gun slung across him, put up his hands and walked toward the squad cars as someone yelled at police that the man just shot someone. Several police cars drove past him toward the people who had been shot.

Police said they fear that the shooting stemmed from a conflict between 'self-styled militias' defending local businesses from looters amid the ongoing unrest over the shooting of Jacob Blake.

Blake remains in hospital after being shot multiple times by a white Kenosha officer on Sunday, prompting a wave of protests that continued despite a curfew.

Several civilians were carrying weapons during the protests on Tuesday night and the gunman was believed to have been guarding a local car shop at some point prior to the shootings, according to videos posted online.

The so-called militias have had weapons slung over their shoulders or at the ready while standing guard outside businesses to protect them from looters or arsonists.

The sheriff told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel that armed vigilantes had been patrolling Kenosha's streets in recent nights, but he did not know if the gunman was among them.

However, video taken before the shooting shows police tossing bottled water from an armored vehicle to what appear to be armed civilians walking the streets. One of them appears to be Rittenhouse.

'We appreciate you being here,' an officer is heard saying to the group over a loudspeaker.

The sheriff later defended officers by saying, 'Our deputies would toss water to anybody.'

Witness Sam Dirks, 22, from Milwaukee, said he had seen the suspected gunman earlier in the evening and he was yelling at some of the protesters.

'He was definitely very agitated. He was pacing around, just pointing his gun in general. Not necessarily at anyone specifically,' Dirks said.

Another witness, Julio Rosas, 24, said that when the gunman stumbled and fell, 'two people jumped onto him and there was a struggle for control of his rifle. At that point during the struggle, he just began to fire multiple rounds and that dispersed people near him.'

'The rifle was being jerked around in all directions while it was being fired,' Rosas said.

Another protester Devin Scott told the Chicago Tribune that he witnessed the initial shooting and helped provide aid to the victim shot in the head.

'We were all chanting 'Black lives matter' at the gas station and then we heard, boom, boom, and I told my friend, that´s not fireworks,' the 19-year-old said.

'And then this guy with this huge gun runs by us in the middle of the street and people are yelling, 'He shot someone! He shot someone!' And everyone is trying to fight the guy, chasing him and then he started shooting again.'

Scott said he rushed to help the injured man, saying: 'I was cradling him in my arms. I was trying to keep this kid alive and he wasn't moving or nothing. He was just laying there.

'I didn't know what to do and then this woman starts performing CPR. There was no pulse. I don´t think he made it.'

In the wake of the killings, Wisconsin Gov. Tony Evers authorized 500 members of the National Guard to support local law enforcement around Kenosha, doubling the number of troops sent in. The governor's office said he working other states to bring in additional National Guard troops and law officers.

Before the gunfire erupted, police in riot gear fired rubber bullets, tear gas and flash-bang rounds to push back demonstrators who defied a dawn-to-dusk curfew and gathered outside a courthouse and adjacent park.

About 300 demonstrators defied the city's 8pm curfew again after Governor Tony Evers declared a state of emergency earlier following a night of violence and destruction that saw rioters set fire to businesses and vehicles across the city.

The shooting of Blake comes three months after the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis which sparked nationwide protests against police brutality and racism.

The Kenosha County Sheriff's Department also deployed at least four armored patrol vehicles fitted with roof turrets from which deputies fired tear gas canisters into the crowd, many of whom hurled water bottles, bricks, firecrackers and other objects back at police.

But there was no immediate sign of buildings or cars being set ablaze, as happened on Monday night.

Demonstrators, some of whom were wearing helmets and equipped with makeshift protective gear, were seen trying to storm a black iron fence that had been installed earlier to protect the court from rioters.

Meanwhile, officers dressed in riot gear stood guard behind the barrier, holding up shields as protesters shouted expletives and hurled bottles at them.

Footage from the scene also showed people throwing fireworks in the direction of cops as they ignored their orders to disperse.

In one video shared by a journalist on Twitter, one man was seen trying to set fire to an American flag before being deterred by pepperballs fired by police.

Kenosha County sheriffs deputies warned crowds over loud speaker that they were participating in an unlawful gathering while urging them to leave the area.

The crowd responded by chanting 'black lives matter', prompting police to fire rubber bullets.

Several military-style armored patrol vehicles were also called in and were seen maneuvering around the county courthouse, firing tear gas at the crowd.

About three hours after declaring the protest an unlawful assembly, authorities had managed to push Tuesday night's crowd out of the downtown park, with demonstrators scattering down streets.

The disturbances came hours after Governor Evers vowed to deploy additional National Guard troops in a bid to restore order in the town, while Blake's mother publicly appealed for calm during a press conference held outside the court.

On Tuesday, President Trump, who has consistently denounced the BLM protests that have rocked the country in recent months, urged Wisconsin officials to call in the National Guard to quell the unrest, despite troops already being on the ground.

'Governor should call in the National Guard in Wisconsin. It is ready, willing, and more than able. End problem FAST!' Trump tweeted.

White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows later revealed Governor Evers had turned down Trump's offer for federal assistance, the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported.

A spokeswoman for Evers told the paper: 'The governor informed them that we would be increasing Wisconsin National Guard support in Kenosha and therefore would not need federal assistance in response to protests but would welcome additional federal support and resources for our state's response to COVID-19.'

Blake, 29, a father of six, was struck from behind at point-blank range in a hail of bullets fired on Sunday by police who were following him with guns drawn as he walked away from officers to his car and opened a door to the vehicle.

Three of his young sons inside the automobile - aged three, five and eight - witnessed their father being gunned down, according to civil rights attorney Ben Crump, who represents the Blake family.

A bystander captured the encounter in video footage that immediately went viral, unleashing outrage over the latest in a long series of instances in which police have been accused of using indiscriminate lethal force against African Americans.

Blake, who had been attempting to break up a quarrel between two women, was struck by multiple gunshots fired at him, all by one officer.

Crump also revealed Blake was undergoing surgery for his injuries, adding that the bullets severed his spinal cord and shattered his vertebrae. Another attorney said there was also severe damage to organs.

'It's going to take a miracle for Jacob Blake Jr to ever walk again,' Crump said.

The legal team plans to file a civil lawsuit against the police department over the shooting.

Police have not explained why Blake was shot.

At a news conference earlier in the day, Blake's parents expressed anguish over the shooting while decrying two previous nights of looting, vandalism and arson that overshadowed peaceful street protests.

'They shot my son seven times, seven times, like he didn't matter,' Jacobv Blake Sr said tearfully as he spoke to reporters alongside other family members and lawyers.

'But my son matters. He's a human being and he matters.'

Blake's mother, Julia Jackson, said the damage in Kenosha does not reflect what her family wants and that, if her son could see it, he would be 'very unpleased.'

After a night during which protests devolved into unrest, Gov. Evers had called for calm Tuesday saying: 'We cannot allow the cycle of systemic racism and injustice to continue.'

'We also cannot continue going down this path of damage and destruction.'

The night before crowds destroyed dozens of buildings and set more than 30 fires in the southeastern Wisconsin city's downtown.

On Monday, heavily armed residents were also seen standing guard outside buildings and local shops in case they were targeted by rioters.

In footage shared online, a group of men were seen carrying rifles and wearing combat gear as they protect local shops. They denied they are part of a militia.

Demonstrations have been staged at nearly 140 college campuses in the US, spanning 45 states and Washington DC since protests began at Columbia University in New York.

Dramatic scenes unfolded at Columbia about a week ago when more than 100 students were arrested after police officers entered the campus.

The university called on the police to tackle demonstrators who had occupied Hamilton Hall, renaming it Hind’s Hall, after a six-year-old Palestinian girl who was killed in Gaza.

Afterwards, Joe Biden, rejected claims that the protests were non-violent. “Destroying property is not a peaceful protest; it’s against the law,” the US president said.

Biden added: “There is no place for hate speech or violence of any kind, whether it’s antisemitism, Islamophobia, or discrimination against Arab Americans or Palestinian Americans.”

Since then, students at about 14 UK universities have also set up encampments.

Hala Hanina, a Palestinian student who has been involved in protests at the Newcastle University, said: “It’s so important for the student community and British community that they are fighting for justice.”

More than a dozen students at Princetonand 10 students at Edinburgh have said they will begin a hunger strike in protest at their university’s policies.

Prof Peter Mathieson, the principal and vice-chancellor at Edinburgh, said: “We have very recently been notified of the intention of an unknown number of students to commence a hunger strike as an indication of their strength of feeling and determination around issues related to Palestine and Israel.

“While we recognise their bodily autonomy, we appeal to them and others not to take risks with their own health, safety and wellbeing. We are in daily contact with the protesters to ensure they are aware of the health and wellbeing support available to them.”",Why have student protests against Israel’s war in Gaza gone global?,1

Protesters were left waiting at Dulles Airport for more than three hours after their transportation failed to show up, the Jewish Federation of Detroit said.

The organization had chartered three flights from the Motor City to take around 900 Israel supporters to the rally on Tuesday.

But the counter-protest by the drivers meant that just a handful made it to the march after many of the buses failed to arrive at the scheduled 10.30am pick-up time.

A 'significant' number of people did not make it to the march at the capital, David Kurzmann, senior director of community affairs at the Jewish Federation of Metropolitan Detroit, told the Detroit News.

Hundreds of Jewish activists were prevented from attending a pro Israel rally in Washington, DC, after buses due to transport them from Dulles Airport to the march failed to show

The transport never arrived due to a 'deliberate and malicious' walkout by the bus drivers, the Jewish Federation of Detroit said

'We have learned from the bus company that this was caused by a deliberate and malicious walk-off of drivers,' he said.

'Fortunately, many were able to travel to the march, and we are grateful to the drivers of those buses that arrived.

'While we are deeply dismayed by this disgraceful action, our resolve to proudly stand in solidarity with the people of Israel, to condemn antisemitism and to demand the return of every hostage held by Hamas has never been greater.'

One man who was unable to attend the rally called the action 'against our democracy'.

'The freedom to assemble is a constitutionally protected right. Antisemitism is alive and well,' he said.

'We never made it to the rally, we never made it past the tarmac. That's I guess how things work when you want to attend a peaceful protest.'

He also cited other alleged examples of other people being denied access to the rally.

'This is not an isolated event,' he added. 'Flights from many other cities got canceled or didn't make it off the tarmac due to similar antisemitic corruption.'

Activists were left waiting for hours before being told they would have to re-embark their planes and return to Detroit, causing many to miss the rally

The group had flown from Detroit on three planes chartered by the Jewish Federation of Detroit carrying around 900 people

The activists were on their way to a pro-Israel rally in Washington D.C. which saw more than 200,000 supporters turn out at the National Mall

The group had been hoping to travel down to the National Mall to take part in calls for the release of Israeli hostages captured by Hamas during the October 7 attacks that killed 1,400.

The march was also in response to large protests across the globe denouncing Israel's bombardment of Gaza in the days since, which has killed more than 11,000, according to officials in the country.

The rally in D.C. saw more than 200,000 pro-Israel supporters gather in solidarity with the country.

State Sen. Jeremy Moss (D-Southfield) was also among those denied an opportunity to be part of a 'tremendous display of support … for the hostages and a strong rebuke of antisemitism.'

The Detroit News reports the representative was left waiting for three hours before deplaning and loading onto a bus for 30 minutes, before he was told to get back on the plane.

'I'm still awaiting all of the details of why the bus drivers didn't show up,' Moss said

'I've spent my tenure in the Legislature fighting discrimination when seeking goods or services that are denied based on identity or affiliation. There are a lot of questions and we deserve to know the answers.'

After waiting several hours, those who did not make it onto the limited buses began an impromptu protest of their own on the tarmac.

https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2021/apr/04/met-police-criticised-for-arrest-of-two-observers-at-kill-the-bill-protest,1,"Civil liberties campaigners have criticised the Metropolitan police after two independent legal observers were among 107 people arrested following a march through central London on Saturday.

Protesters gathered on Saturday night in London, Bristol, Manchester and several other cities in opposition to a bill that critics say will limit the right to protest.

In London, thousands marched from Hyde Park to Parliament Square, where speeches were given against the police, crime, sentencing and courts bill, which passed its second reading in parliament last month.

Scuffles broke out between protesters and police. Most arrests were of protesters who had been kettled by the police near Aldwych in the early evening.

The two legal observers were from Black Protest Legal Support (BPLS), an organisation led by black and brown lawyers who provide free legal support to protesters.

The campaign group Liberty brought legal action against the Met after four legal observers from BPLS were arrested at a protest last month.

A spokesperson from BPLS described the latest arrests as concerning and egregious, saying the pair were wearing hi-vis bibs identifying them as legal observers and were complying with police instructions to move away from the kettle and maintain distancing when they were arrested. One was released from police custody at 2am on Sunday while the other was detained until 9am.

“We’re really concerned by the continued and systemic use of violence against protesters and independent legal observers”, the spokesperson said, adding that the arrest of observers undermined their ability to independently monitor the police’s conduct at protests and hold them to account.

2:01 Police and protesters clash during London 'kill the bill' rally – video

BPLS said the pair fall under exemptions from Covid restrictions granted to volunteers.

Sam Grant, the head of policy and campaigns at Liberty, said arresting legal observers was “an intimidatory tactic to deter protest”.

He said: “Legal observers help to make sure protesters’ rights are respected and police act within the law. If officers believe they are acting lawfully, they should welcome this scrutiny.

“Continuing to arrest independent monitors is a scandalous attack on the right to protest and demonstrates exactly why people are taking to the streets against the government’s plans to give the police even more powers.”

The Met confirmed that a man and a woman acting as legal observers were arrested in The Strand. The force said both were arrested under health protection regulations and reported for consideration for a fine.

A spokesperson said the arrests of the 107 people in connection with the protest were for a range of alleged offences including breach of the peace, violent disorder, assault on police and breaches of Covid legislation. One woman was arrested on suspicion of possession of an offensive weapon.

Commander Ade Adelekan of the Met said the vast majority of those who attended adhered to social distancing rules but a small number were “intent on remaining to cause disruption to law-abiding Londoners”.

“Despite repeated instructions from officers to leave, they did not and, amid increasing levels of disorder, arrests were made,” Adelekan said.

In Bristol, which has become the focus of opposition to the government’s bill, police clashed with protesters for the fourth time in two weeks.

More than 1,000 protesters gathered in the city and at one point a group marched up the M32 motorway and brought traffic to a standstill by sitting down on the carriageways.

After numbers dwindled to about 100, Avon and Somerset police put in place a dispersal order and scores of officers were deployed to drive the remaining protesters out of the city centre.

Several who refused to leave were arrested, and officers with riot shields and dogs chased the rest into a park and away. Police said they made seven arrests.

There have been five demonstrations in the city, with only one passing peacefully. Protesters have criticised police for what they see as heavy-handed tactics.

Bristol’s area commander, Supt Mark Runacres, said: “Policing protests is always difficult in that we have to balance the rights of protesters with other members of the public. At times a relatively small group of people did cause significant disruption to motorists as they marched through Bristol and on to the motorway and I understand the frustration that would have caused.

“Our priority is always the safety of the public and, like all incidents, we evaluated every action the protesters took based on the threat, harm and risk they posed to themselves and to others. Dispersing protesters while they were on a live carriageway presented an unacceptable risk and the safest thing to do was to allow the protest to run its course.

“At around midnight there were several altercations between the small number of people who remained in the city centre. We never tolerate violence and so we made the decision to move people on. It’s disappointing that once again there were those who refused to listen to our requests to leave and that we had to make arrests.”

Portland was roiled by its 100th night of anti-racism protests on Saturday as demonstrators ignited a spat of Molotov cocktails during stand-offs with police firing tear gas, rubber bullets and pepper balls into the crowds.

Nearly 30 people were arrested after hundreds of people marched toward a police precinct and department officials declared a riot - prompting the situation to devolve into one of the city's most violent clashes so far this summer.

Meanwhile in Pittsburgh, officers were forced to stand guard outside Mayor Bill Peduto's home as a group of demonstrators gathered outside his home with lights and bells as they called for action against local law enforcement.

Further down south, just under 20 people were arrested on Saturday in Tallahassee, Florida, during protests after a Leon County Grand Jury ruled that three officer-involved shootings were justified.

The Kentucky Derby was marred by heavily-armed Trump supporters faced off with members of the anti-Trump militia, Not F***** Around Coalition,' who also gathered in Louisville.

And anti-Trump group Refuse Fascism staged a series of protests across the United States on Saturday, as America's chaotic and turbulent summer continued.

Portland

On Saturday, the spirit of protest remained strong as hundreds carrying signs, donning helmets and waving Black Lives Matter flags descended upon Portland for the 100th night of demonstrations.

Around midnight, the Portland Police Bureau noted that people were marching near Ventura Park as part of 'unpermitted' demonstration.

But just minutes later, authorities said that some groups were engaging in 'tumultuous and violent conduct' and labeled the demonstration a 'riot.'

'Portland Police note that persons on Southeast Stark are engaging in tumultuous and violent conduct thereby intentionally or recklessly creating a grave risk of causing public alarm,' they said.

'This is a riot. Police are giving announcements to disperse People are throwing Molotov cocktails.'

Photos and video taken from the demonstration show a number of Molotov cocktails being launched into roadways as a small army of officers stand nearby.

In one video, officers implore residents to disperse from the area as Molotov cocktails crash against the pavement and fire erupts.

'This has been declared an unlawful assembly,' officers say. 'All persons immediately leave the area. Failure to adhere to this order may subject you too arrest, citation or the use of crowd control agents including but not limited to tear gas and, or impact weapons.'

Seconds later, a Molotov cocktail is thrown but drops dangerously close to a protester standing in the roadway.

A wave a gasps are heard as a man rushes out of the inferno with both his feet on fire. The man desperately tries to kick the fire away but needs assistance from other demonstrators.

'Stop, drop and roll!' one person shouts. The man on fire rolls across the ground but is forced to take his shoes off as the fire continues to burn the fabric.

After that, footage shows a 'war' erupting in Portland as loud fireworks are blasted into the air, smoke from the Molotov cocktails billow and the line of officers move in on the protesters.

The Portland Police Bureau revealed in a press release that 27 people were arrested between Friday night and Saturday morning after protesters refused to vacate area.

The march began in Kenton Park on Friday, a common site for previous protests, before winding towards the Portland Police Association building.

Officers reportedly used stun grenades, shot impact munitions and smoke devices to clear the demonstrators.

The Oregonian reports that traces of blood were visible on the ground where officers had pinned and detained residents.

'After rocks were thrown at officers, an unlawful assembly was declared at the Portland Police Association offices in North Portland, and numerous arrests were made,' the department said in the statement.

Authorities claimed they waited 90 minutes for deescalation methods before making any arrests.

Fireworks and Molotov cocktails were launched on Saturday as law enforcement and anti-racism demonstrators clashed for the 100th night in a row this year

'Officers began to make targeted arrests and in some cases moved the crowd back and kept them out of the street. Several times officers pulled back and allowed members of the assembly an opportunity to leave,' the statement read.

According to the statement, the majority of those arrested were from Portland, but one man was from West Virginia and another from Washington state.

After the riot was declared, a BLM 'snack van' that hands out food to protesters pulled up to an intersection blocked by police and faced officers in a tense standoff.

When a line of riot police charged the BLM demonstrators they scattered, and officers were filmed sprinting after the fleeing protesters down normally quiet streets lined with family homes, pinning them to the ground and cuffing them while others shouted insults and taunts.

Neighbors blocked their roads with traffic cones and barrels to prevent protesters parking and joining the demonstration that devolved into a riot.

A local standing outside his home told DailyMail.com that at one point a line of hundreds of marchers trooping down East Burnside Street by Ventura Park stretched almost twenty city blocks.

Another resident complained on Twitter that he and his pregnant wife were forced to put on respirators in their home as the clouds of tear gas wafted into the suburban streets nearby.

The Portlander tweeted at Mayor Ted Wheeler: 'I'm at home with my pregnant wife with respirators on in our own goddamn house you son of a b****!'

'My neighborhood is f***ing filled with smoke and my pregnant wife and I have put on respirators inside of our own damn house. I am f***ing furious right now at PPB.'

Saturday night's unrest came days after Michael Reinoehl, 48, was shot dead by members of a federal task force in Washington, after they attempted to apprehend him on murder charges in the killing of Aaron 'Jay' Danielson, 39.

Danielson was allegedly shot in the chest by Reinoehl after clashes between Trump supporters and Black Lives Matter protesters broke out during a rally in Portland on August 29.

Pittsburgh

The Mayor of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, was confronted over his city's policies and law enforcement at his home Saturday night by upset residents.

Around 100 people met in the East Liberty neighborhood for 'Civil Saturdays,' the name given to their continued protests, they traveled through downtown.

The Post-Gazzette reports that Saturday's demonstration was meant to disrupt restaurant diners and residents with a call for Black Lives Matter.

'Out of the bars and into the streets,' the group chanted.

At one point, protest leader Nique Craft stood in front of an apartment building to address residents watching the protest from their balconies.

'Four people were arrested just for doing exactly this,' she said.

Tensions flared on the trek to Peduto's home after one restaurant employee reportedly told members of the protest to 'go back to their own country.'

Mayor Peduto's home was surrounded by a line of Pittsburgh police officers who stood guard at the front door (pictured)

Once outside Peduto's home, demonstrators were met with a half-dozen Pittsburgh police officers standing in front of the mayor's door.

After standing there for a short time, Post-Gazzette reports that officers began putting on their riot helmets.

'I don't see a riot here why are you in riot gear?' protesters chanted in response.

The group eventually left Peduto's home and the demonstration peacefully dispersed just after 10pm.

Rochester

Residents in Rochester, New York, gathered for the fourth night in a row to protest the death of Daniel Prude, a 29-year-old black man who was shot seven times in the back by law enforcement.

Police used batons, pepper balls and tear gas to push back about 2,000 protesters who marched toward the Public Safety Building on Saturday night, chanting 'Black Lives Matter' and 'Daniel Prude' - a reference to the Black man who died after an encounter with police in March.

The Rochester Police Department said in a statement that protesters had ignored their orders to disperse, and that some hurled bottles, rocks and fireworks at officers.

Fox News reports that 11 people and three officers were injured on Friday night as tensions flared the night before.

On Friday, a large group of Black Lives Matter protesters surrounded a restaurant diners were eating.

In Washington DC, protesters took to the streets on skateboards, on bicycles and on foot, heading for Lafayette Square and the White House.

President Donald Trump spent Saturday playing golf at his course in Sterling, Virginia, and so was not home for their noisy demonstration.

The crowd held aloft the orange placards, and posed for photos in front of the White House.

Some had hand-made signs demanding the defunding of police, and an end to police brutality.

Outside Trump's golf course, meanwhile, rival pro- and anti-Trump demonstrators waved their flags.

Some brandished Biden-Harris banners, while others held flags in support of the president.

Louisville

In Kentucky, armed supporters of the police and anti-racism protesters squared off near the famed Kentucky Derby horse race on Saturday, as dueling demonstrations over racial justice and policing continued to grind on across U.S. cities.

As the afternoon wore on, a large group of protesters marched toward the Churchill Downs track chanting 'No Justice, No Derby' - a nod to an earlier call by activists for the historic race in Louisville, Kentucky, to be canceled.

The race was being held without spectators to prevent the spread of the coronavirus.

Earlier on Saturday, some of the counter-protesters outside Churchill Downs, brandishing pistols and long guns, squared off with a group of Black Lives Matter protesters and got into shoving matches.

People on both sides screamed, faces inches apart. After about 45 minutes, police cleared the people from the park, but the protests outside Churchill Downs continued.

The counter-protesters included about 250 pro-police demonstrators called 'The Angry Vikings,' who were armed and dressed in tactical gear.

Demonstrations against racism and police brutality have swept the United States since May 25 when George Floyd, a Black man, died after a Minneapolis police officer knelt on his neck for nearly nine minutes.

Meanwhile, a group of about 200 members of NFAC — a black militia group which has protested against police killings of black people — had gathered at a park just outside Churchill Downs and were inspecting their weapons, with the Derby preliminaries well underway inside.

Most of the NFAC militia members came from Georgia, according to a local reporter, Travis Ragsdale

NFAC, which stands for 'Not F***ing Around Coalition,' was in the city in July protesting injustice in the Breonna Taylor case.

Organizers said they would return if Kentucky Attorney General Daniel Cameron didn't complete the investigation into Breonna Taylor's death.

Louisville has emerged as one flashpoint in a summer of unrest due to the death of Taylor, a black 26-year-old woman who was killed when the city's police burst into her apartment with a 'no-knock' arrest warrant in March.

'When they start the race, ain't nobody going to be enjoying themselves,' NFAC leader John 'Grandmaster Jay' Johnson said.

'You see, they're looking at us right now. They really don't give a damn about no race.

'Louisville, y'all brought this on yourself.'

Johnson then led the group back to G.G. Moore Park, where the NFAC's march began, shortly before the running of the Derby.

As the NFAC did a 'weapons check' before the start of the march at G.G. Moore Park, WDRB reported that one of the leaders only wanted people with long weapons.

'If you're only carrying a pistol, you will not be allowed in this formation,' he reportedly said.

https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/feb/17/first-thing-biden-pledges-600m-vaccine-doses-available-by-late-july,1,"Good morning.

Joe Biden laid out further plans for tackling the coronavirus pandemic yesterday, including a promise to make 600m doses of vaccines available by the end of July, enough to vaccinate every American, according to the president. Biden also said teachers should be “moved up the hierarchy” of the vaccine rollout, as he predicted that the majority of elementary schools would reopen within his first 100 days in office.

Addressing a small and social distanced crowd in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, at a town hall event, Biden was asked when life would get back to normal, to which he replied: “By next Christmas we’ll be in a very different circumstance, God willing, than we are today.”

Latino and Black Americans are being vaccinated at much lower rates despite being at disproportionately high risk of suffering serious symptoms of coronavirus. Only 3% of Latinos and 4.5% of Black Americans have so far received a vaccine shot, compared with 9.1% of white Americans.

Fema has opened up its first Covid-19 mass vaccination sites as part of the government’s efforts to ramp up the pace of inoculations and reach communities disproportionately affected by the pandemic. The Federal Emergency Management Agency set up its first site in Los Angeles, aiming to vaccinate up to 6,000 people a day.

At least 21 people have died due to the ferocious winter weather

Extreme winter weather tearing across the central and southern US has killed at least 21 people and left millions without power. Parts of the US have seen record-breaking cold temperatures, while Texas has seen the worst power outages, with more than 4m homes and businesses left without power on Tuesday as temperatures remained below freezing. In the Houston area, four family members died in a house fire after using the fireplace to stay warm.

Conservative commentators have sought to blame renewable energy for the electricity outages, with the Texas agriculture minister saying “we should never build another wind turbine” in the state. In reality, failures in gas, coal and nuclear energy were responsible for nearly twice as many outages as renewables, the Electric Reliability Council of Texas said on Tuesday. But the outages might have a wider cause: some scientists have argued that the freezing weather is linked to the climate crisis. According to experts, the rapid heating of the Arctic can help push frigid air from the north pole much further south, possibly as far as the US-Mexico border. One scientist said:

The current conditions in Texas are historical, certainly generational. But this can’t be hand-waved away as if it’s entirely natural. This is happening not in spite of climate change, it’s in part due to climate change.

Oil companies should disclose their carbon emissions, BlackRock, the world’s biggest investor, has said. All companies the firm invests in will be expected to do so, a letter said, in a sign of a reassessment of climate risks.

Climate change probably delayed the migration of plant-eating dinosaurs, a study has found, concluding that the dinosaurs probably arrived in the northern hemisphere years after their meat-eating relatives. The study has far-reaching implications for our understanding of the creatures.

Donald Trump and Rudy Giuliani are getting sued over the Capitol attack

Donald Trump and his personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani are being taken to court by a Democratic congressman and the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People over their alleged role in the deadly Capitol attack. The lawsuit, brought under a historic law known as the Ku Klux Klan Act, accuses the pair of conspiring to incite the violent insurrection at the Capitol with the aim of stopping Joe Biden’s election being certified.

It comes three days after Trump was acquitted during a Senate trial for inciting the violence. The Senate minority leader, Mitch McConnell, pointed out that presidents were “not immune” to criminal or civil litigation.

Steve Bannon believed Trump had early-stage dementia and campaigned covertly to remove him from office via the 25th amendment, a TV producer has claimed. The former White House strategist reportedly thought he could replace Trump as president.

The majority of Republican voters want Trump to play a prominent role in the GOP, according to a new poll, at 59%. This is an increase of 18 points from the last poll, taken after the Capitol riot.

Fast-food workers are on strike across the US

Fast-food staff and care workers in 15 cities across the US went on strike yesterday, demanding the minimum wage be increased to $15 per hour. Staff at McDonald’s, Burger King and Wendy’s stood with home care and nursing workers in the action. It comes as Biden attempts to push through an increase in the federal minimum wage from $7.25, which hasn’t been increased since 2009.

The battle over the minimum wage is a “moral issue masquerading as an economic one”, writes Hamilton Nolan, arguing that it is an outrage that the pay has not increased for more than 10 years despite the economic hardship America has endured in that time.

Kinzinger called for Trump to be removed from office after the mob attack on the Capitol, leading his family to say he had gone “against your Christian principles and join the ‘devil’s army’ (Democrats and the fake news media).” They underlined the word “disappointment” three times for emphasis.

It's expected to largely focus on Donald Trump's 'state of mind' as his supporters stormed the US Capitol last year, committee aides said in a call on Wednesday.

Notably, there will be no testimony from live witnesses during the expected two-and-a-half hour event.

In-person accounts from people like former White House aide Cassidy Hutchinson and Georgia election worker Shaye Moss had made for some of the most compelling and memorial moments of the committee's set of summer hearings.

Thursday is also expected to make public some of 'the hundreds of thousands of pages that the United States Secret Service has produced' after being subpoenaed by the committee in July.

The Secret Service was thrown into the center of the committee's months-long investigation when 25-year-old Hutchinson testified about being told that Trump physically attacked an agent who refused to drive him to the US Capitol with his supporters.

While live witnesses are not scheduled to appear, Punchbowl News reported that new video of longtime GOP operative and Trump ally Roger Stone could be shown.

Aides would not go into detail about the witnesses or material to be shown in the hearing during their Wednesday call with reporters.

January 6 committee aides were hesitant to categorize Thursday's hearing as their 'closing argument' though Chairman Bennie Thompson indicated it might be the final installment

'There's going to be some discussion of events that took place prior to Election Day. There's going to be some looking at events that took place after January 6, and we're going to bring a focus - particular focus - on the former president's state of mind and his his involvement in these events as they unfolded,' a committee aide said.

'So what you're gonna see is a synthesis of some evidence we've already presented, with that new, never-before-seen information to illustrate Donald Trump's centrality from the time prior to the election.'

Asked whether anything would come from the recent deposition of Ginni Thomas, wife of Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas, aides said they were 'just not able to get into details either about how we conduct interviews with witnesses or what we're going to see tomorrow.'

Though aides were hesitant to categorize it as the panel's 'closing argument,' Chairman Bennie Thompson (D-Miss.) previously indicated to reporters that this hearing could be their last before a final report, expected by the end of the year, is released.

The hearing was previously set for September 28 but had to be postponed due to Hurricane Ian.

'I’m reluctant to sort of label this as a closing argument,' an aide said Wednesday.

Questions have also been raised about what role, if any, will be played on Thursday by Ginni Thomas (left), wife of Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas, and longtime GOP trickster Roger Stone (right)

The committee has sought to draw a link between Donald Trump and his allies' bid to overturn the 2020 election and an allegedly planned day of violence at the US Capitol

'It’s difficult to know for sure what the select committee’s schedule will be going forward, the investigation is ongoing.'

The aide also said 'there are ongoing threats to our democracy that persists to this day.'

Unlike in previous hearings, which were co-led by two different lawmakers on the panel each time, all nine committee members are expected to speak on Thursday.

The summer saw the January 6 committee present bombshell testimony from members of Trump's orbit as well as people who participated in the insurrection, including members of far-right militia groups.

Lawmakers painted a picture of a president who was swayed by allies outside the White House into not ceding power despite official staff and advisers warning that there was no legal pathway to reversing his 2020 loss.

Vice Chair Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.) said at one of the first hearings that last year's attack on the US Capitol was not a sudden outbreak of violence but rather Trump and his allies' 'last stand' in a months-long plot to upend American democracy.

Trump, for his part, still maintains that the 2020 election was stolen via widespread voter fraud.

He's dismissed the panel of lawmakers as a partisan political cudgel, routinely mocking them as 'the unselect committee' among other nicknames.",January 6 committee set to focus on Trump's 'state of mind' in what could be its final hearing,1
https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/mar/23/mo-brooks-donald-trump-rescind-2020-election,1,"The Alabama Republican congressman Mo Brooks said on Tuesday Donald Trump asked him to “rescind” the 2020 election, remove Joe Biden from the White House and reinstate Trump.

The extraordinary statement came in an angry response to a withdrawn endorsement in a US Senate race. Trump was angered that Brooks was insufficiently toeing his line on calling the 2020 election a fraud.

Brooks’ statement is likely to be of interest to the January 6 committee. The panel is investigating Trump’s lie about electoral fraud in his defeat by Biden, efforts to marshal members of Congress to object to election results, a rally near the White House on 6 January 2021 which Trump and Brooks addressed, and the deadly attack on the US Capitol that followed.

On Wednesday, after Trump withdrew his endorsement, Brooks said he was still in the Alabama race as the only true Trumpist candidate. He also claimed to have known he risked losing the former president’s endorsement by telling him “the truth” and added: “I repeat what has prompted President Trump’s ire.”

“The only legal way America can prevent 2020’s election debacle is for patriotic Americans to focus on and win the 2022 and 2024 elections so that we have the power to enact laws that will give us honest and accurate elections.”

He added: “President Trump asked me to rescind the 2020 elections, immediately remove Joe Biden from the White House, immediately put President Trump back in the White House, and hold a new special election for the presidency.

“As a lawyer, I’ve repeatedly advised President Trump that 6 January was the final election contest verdict and neither the US constitution nor the US Code [the laws of the United States] permit what President Trump asks. Period.”

Brooks also said he “took a sworn oath to defend and protect the US constitution”, an oath he said he would “break … for no man”.

However, Brooks has until now been one of Trump’s most ardent supporters, including on and around the events of 6 January.

Addressing the “Stop the Steal” rally at the Ellipse in Washington DC, Brooks said: “Today is the day American patriots start taking down names and kicking ass.

“Now, our ancestors sacrificed their blood, their sweat, their tears, their fortunes and sometimes their lives … Are you willing to do the same? My answer is yes. Louder! Are you willing to do what it takes to fight for America?”

Trump told supporters to “fight like hell” to stop the certification of election results.

According to a bipartisan Senate report, seven deaths were linked to the riot that followed. Nearly 800 people have been charged, some with seditious conspiracy. Trump was impeached for inciting an insurrection but acquitted when enough Republican senators stayed loyal.

In the aftermath of the riot, Brooks was the first of 147 Republican members of Congress to vote against certifying election results. His role in the “Stop the Steal” movement has been under scrutiny ever since.

Multiple reporters have placed Brooks with other far-right Republicans including Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia and Jim Jordan of Ohio in White House meetings with Trump. An organiser of the 6 January rally, the convicted felon Ally Alexander, has named Brooks and two Arizona Republicans, Paul Gosar and Andy Biggs, as members of Congress who helped plan the event.

Brooks said he spoke at the invitation of the White House and had no recollection of communicating with Alexander. He has also confirmed he wore body armour while giving his speech.

The January 6 committee has been weighing whether to seek to compel Brooks to testify.

A Democrat, Eric Swalwell of California, sued Brooks, Trump, Donald Trump Jr and Rudy Giuliani for violating federal civil rights law and local incitement law. In February, a federal judge said he would dismiss Brooks, Giuliani and Trump Jr from the suit, because their speeches were political and thus protected by the first amendment.

Brooks’s campaign for Senate features warnings of “dictatorial socialism and its threat to liberty, freedom and the very fabric of American society”.

He had attracted Trump’s endorsement. But in a statement on Wednesday, Trump said: “Mo Brooks of Alabama made a horrible mistake recently when he went ‘woke’ and stated, referring to the 2020 Presidential Election Scam, ‘Put that behind you, put that behind you.’

“When I heard this statement, I said, ‘Mo, you just blew the election, and there’s nothing you can do about it.’”

In response, Brooks accused Trump of being “manipulated” by Mitch McConnell, the Republican leader in the Senate. McConnell and Trump have split since the Capitol attack, after which McConnell voted to acquit Trump at trial but also excoriated him in a speech on the Senate floor.

In a second statement on Wednesday, Trump said of McConnell: “I am not a fan and there’s been no harsher critic than me. He has been absolutely terrible … the sooner he leaves ‘Leadership’, the better off the Republican party will be.”

McConnell’s place seems safe and the party establishment he leads reportedly fears that extreme pro-Trump candidates could jeopardise Republicans’ chances of retaking the Senate this year. A model for such a failure exists in Alabama, where in 2017 an extremist, Roy Moore, was beaten by the Democrat Doug Jones.

Brooks has however fallen behind in polling and fundraising. Katie Britt, a former aide to the retiring senator, Richard Shelby, is well placed to secure the nomination.",Republican says Trump asked him to ‘rescind’ 2020 election and remove Biden from office,1

Floyd, a 46-year-old black man, was filmed gasping for breath as a white officer knelt on his neck for eight minutes before he died in custody of the Minneapolis Police Department on Monday.

The father-of-two's death led to a series of violent rallies in Minneapolis and Los Angeles, where outraged protesters demanded authorities charge the four stood-down police officer's involved in Floyd's arrest.

Footage showed the journalist duck for cover as a stun grenade was fired in her direction by police officers who descended on the protest.

Mullany said tensions only grew when police arrived to control the crowds of outraged citizens.

'What happened was about six police cars out of nowhere arrived and they came out in riot gear,' she told the Sunrise newsroom.

'It seems like they were prepared for some sort of confrontation.'

'But it really was like throwing a match in the tinder at that point. It was incredible to see how that anger exploded in a matter of seconds.

'The police were not welcome on the streets here.'

Chaos first erupted in the city on Tuesday night after thousands of protesters took to the streets in the wake of Floyd’s death.

But demonstrations turned violent on Wednesday after one suspected looter was shot dead, prompting the officials to call in the National Guard ahead of Thursday evening’s protests.

'We've seen police try to disperse crowds with tear gas, with those stunt grenades, so we have seen people injured.

'Just walking from the car to here I saw pools of blood on the payment so there have definitely been injuries in these riots.'

Arvier also saw a tear gas canister fired at a protester at 'point blank range'.

'It's a tense situation,' he said.

'We are having stun grenades being thrown into the crowd now things are getting ugly.'

Arvier continued to speak to the newsroom as he manoeuvred through the crowds on Thursday.

Today hosts Stefanovic and Allison Langdon asked Arvier if the protesters heard the news that the police officers may not be charged with Floyd's death.

Arvier replied: 'No, we haven't heard that. We certainly haven't seen any - haven't heard anyone talking about that but we are just on our way down to the police station.'

The Today hosts urged Arvier avoid breaking the news to the demonstrators so he could stay safe.

'Don't break it to them. Don't be the one that breaks it to them.'

At a press conference on Thursday, prosecutors warned there is 'evidence that does not support criminal charges' against the four cops.

Mike Freeman, county attorney for Hennepin County, condemned the actions of white cop Derek Chauvin as 'horrific and terrible', but said prosecutors needed to determine if he used 'excessive' force when he knelt on Floyd's neck until he passed out and later died.

'That video is graphic and horrific and terrible and no person should do that,' he said.

'But my job in the end is to prove he violated a criminal statute - but there is other evidence that does not support a criminal charge.'

A fatal shooting and lawsuit for excessive force: What we know about the four officers fired for George Floyd's arrest Derek Chauvin In 2006 Derek Chauvin (pictured), 44, was one of six officers connected to the death of Wayne Reyes The white police officer who knelt on George Floyd's neck has already been investigated over three police shootings and a fatal car chase. In 2006 Derek Chauvin, 44, was one of six officers connected to the death of Wayne Reyes. Reyes, 42 was killed by officers after allegedly pulling a shotgun on the six cops, which included Chauvin. Also that year he was named in a lawsuit filed by an inmate at the Minnesota Correctional Facility. The case was dismissed in 2007. Two years later Chauvin was investigated for his role in the 2008 shooting of Ira Latrell Toles during a domestic assault call. Toles was wounded after police said he went for an officer's gun and Chauvin shot him. That same year Chauvin was handed a medal of valor for 'his response in an incident involving a man armed with a gun.' But in 2011 23-year-old Leroy Martinez was shot and injured during a chase given by officers including Chauvin. Chauvin was arrested Friday - four days after Floyd's death - and charged with third degree murder and manslaughter.

Minneapolis braced for a third night of violence on Thursday after protests in the city turned deadly overnight.

State troopers have already been called in and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey asked for the National Guard's help after one suspected looter was fatally shot and stores were left ransacked and torched.

Shocking images Thursday morning showed the widespread destruction left overnight after stores including Wendy's, Target, Walmart and Autozone were looted and some even set on fire.

Mayor Frey pleaded for calm ahead of more expected protests this evening telling residents 'we cannot let tragedy beget more tragedy.'

Videos also showed what was reported to be an apartment building entirely engulfed by flames as rioters stood and watched and the fire department was nowhere to be seen.

Outside a GM Tobacco store, a group of four men with huge firearms were seen and said they had come to protect local businesses from looters.

DailyMail.com also exclusively reported that protesters on Wednesday even gathered outside the home of fired officer Derek Chauvin and scrawled the word 'Murderer' on his driveway.

A sign was propped up at the end of his driveway reading 'People don't kill people, cops do' as calls mounted for the fired cop to face murder charges over Floyd's death.

Other demonstrators carried signs and wore T-shirts reading 'I can't breathe' - some of the last words Floyd said as he begged the police officer for his life.

Some held signs reading 'Black Lives Matter' and pictures of Floyd as they marched on the property.

They were then met by a wall of police officers who had set up security around Chauvin's home.

Floyd's heartbroken brother Philonise Floyd also urged protesters to demonstrate peacefully, but said he understood the anger surrounding George's death.

'I can't stop people right now because they have pain. They have the same pain that I feel. I want everything to be peaceful but I can't make everybody be peaceful. It's hard,' he told CNN. 'They treated him worse than they treat animals.'

'I watched the video. It was hard but I had to watch. As I watched, those four officers - they executed my brother,' he added.

The collective had previously promoted the 'medical freedom march', which would be 'standing against mandated vaccines and vaccine passports, as the large crowd, understood to be in the thousands, gathering in Hyde Park.

Pictures and video shared online showed the large group, understood to be in the thousands, progressing past Vauxhall Bridge.

Police are monitoring the crowd, as eyewitnesses report at least four riot vans rushed over to the scene.

The demonstrations mark part of a coordinated worldwide protest, seen also in cities in Italy and France, at governments' decisions to impose mandatory vaccinations for some members of society.

The large group started amassing in central London earlier this afternoon, in what is reportedly part of an organised effort matched in other cities in Europe against vaccine passports.

The topic has caused issues in Boris Johnson's government, with him facing a Cabinet revolt and being accused of denying people their fundamental freedoms.

Pictures from the scene show crowds armed with placards bearing slogans including 'my body my choice' and 'hands off our children' as they made their way through the capital on Saturday.

Pictures and video shared on Twitter showed protesters gathering at Hyde Park on Saturday.

People could be seen carrying placards and banners saying 'no medical dictatorship' and 'no vaccine passports', while smoke flares appeared to have been released in one place.

The Metropolitan Police warned of disruption to traffic and bus services as roads became blocked.

The force said crowds moved on to Victoria, on to Vauxhall Bridge Road, and through to Kennington. It is understood protesters are heading towards Clapham Common.

Police advised people to avoid the area at the junction of Brixton Road and Acre Lane in the south of the capital, before confirming it had been cleared for traffic.

The protests come just days after an angry mob of anti-vaxxers stormed the London headquarters of ITV News and Channel 4 News, before then trying to invade a Google office.

Up to 200 demonstrators broke into the building's lobby and demanded to speak to the broadcaster's bosses as part of a protest against vaccine passports and jabs for children on Monday.

Officers, many wearing face coverings, are seen pushing back members of the crowd as tensions clearly began to boil over.

Staff were advised to either remain in the building or stay away until the situation was dealt with just before 3.30pm, when protesters left the building.

The group, which included anti-lockdown demonstrator Piers Corbyn, then made its way to the nearby Google building in Pancras Square, where an activist was filmed standing in front of a crowd with a megaphone, declaring: 'They are not giving you the right information.'",Thousands of anti-vaxxers take to central London to continue campaign against Covid vaccines,1

Neighbouring travellers on a legal site by the infamous plot near Basildon, Essex, say they have 'had enough' of the town and want to move on.

But because the land is worth so little and may have 'up to 60 owners', the plan is proving increasingly difficult.

Their claim comes almost 10 years after taxpayers spent nearly £7million on clearing Dale Farm, where more than 1,000 people lived at its height, but now is a desolate wasteland.

Officials claimed it would be returned to Green Belt land after the eviction battle in October 2011 - but it is still a polluted wasteland blighted by rubbish and the decaying remains of the site.

Now the legal travellers who live on the neighbouring Oak Lane pitches say they want to sell up, and hope a developer swoops in to develop the area for housing.

Stuart Carruthers, who represents the group in court, says the 400 travellers want to leave South Essex.

He said: 'I'm expecting it to be turned into houses at some point and the sooner they do that the better. But there are so many issues they are facing.

'They are struggling to sell the land, it's so cheap. The only reason they settled there was because the land is so cheap.

'The travellers are more than happy to move on, if they get the money for it, otherwise they can't afford to buy anywhere else.

The area is filled with rubbish in 2019 and a number of temporary structures in the background are seen still up

'I think they've had enough of Basildon, they just don't like the town anymore. No one is going to build the homes until a developer comes along and buys it.'

However, any plans for housing would be stymied by 'serious highway problems' as the site is near the busy A127 dual carriageway.

Officials have poured cold water on the plans to develop it with the deputy leader of Basildon Council, Kerry Smith, saying it is not their decision.

He said: 'We don't know who owns the land. It is down to the landowners, with what they want to do with it.

'They need to come together and go through the local plan process and put some recommendations forward. The council is still owed money from the evictions. I think that figure sits around £4million.

'If the council waived that money then I'm sure the landowners will then want to do something.'

The final cost of the Dale Farm eviction was nearly £7million, with Basildon Council picking up a bill for £4.3million whilst Essex Police spent £2.4million on their involvement.

In 2018 it emerged Basildon Council had failed to recover a single penny from the travellers.

Yusef Nazlioglu, 40, was hit with up to ten bullets as he parked his black Mercedes in the building under his Rhodes unit in Sydney's west on Monday night.

His wife Jade Nazlioglu watched the horrific shooting unfold and frantically rang paramedics but her husband was confirmed to have died in hospital about 7.15am on Tuesday.

Ms Nazlioglu, who only married the former Lone Wolf Bikie earlier this year, was spotted in tears talking to friends outside the apartment block on Tuesday morning.

It is now the 14th fatal shooting linked to the Harbour City's spiralling gang war in less than two years.

'Of course I'm not all right, what do you think?' she told The Daily Telegraph.

Recent pictures on her Facebook profile - where she refers to Yusef as her 'king' - show Ms Nazlioglu beaming with happiness as she poses with her husband and shows off her impressive diamond ring.

But that all came crashing down on Monday night.

Bullet holes in the wall, a pool of blood near a fire escape and five orange cones blocking access to a parking space are all that's been left behind in a carpark where her the underworld figure was killed.

Yusuf Nazlioglu, 40, was shot up to ten times after parking his black Mercedes in the complex under his apartment in Rhodes, in Sydney's west on Monday night. Nazlioglu's wife (pictured together) frantically rang paramedics

Daily Mail Australia understands the unidentified gunman was waiting in a silver hatchback for Nazlioglu to get out of the car before opening fire.

The carpark spanned eight floors, with the 40-year-old peppered with bullets in his head and torso in the corner of the fifth level.

Gunshots and screams echoed throughout the cold and cavernous complex as Nazlioglu staggered to the fire exit, where he left spatters of blood.

Despite forensic investigators pressure-hosing the scene, a few bullet holes and blood stains could be seen in the gyprock walls once the police tape was removed.

A black Mercedes with a large bullet hole in a window on the driver's side was also towed from the carpark on Tuesday morning.

All eight levels of the parking lot were closed to residents until about 11.30am, when detectives left the scene holding a brown bag filled with evidence.

The silver hatchback was set on fire a few streets away from the shooting.

Detective Superintendent Martin Hayston said detectives believe the attack was 'targeted'.

'The person who approached the 40-year-old male and shot him clearly was there to do that, there is various lines of inquiry underway in relation to motive,' he said.

Footage showed police sprinting down the ramp of the carpark after Nazlioglu's wife raised the alarm.

Multiple paramedics could be seen walking through the complex, before a heavily bandaged man was stretchered out of the building.

The building includes a shopping centre, apartments and basement carpark.

Plain-clothed detectives arrived at the scene throughout Tuesday morning, as the investigation into the senseless killing continues.

Nazlioglu was charged with murder after Mick Hawi, the ex-kingpin of the Comanchero bikie gang who was he gunned down as he climbed into his luxury four-wheel-drive outside a Fitness First gym in Rockdale in Sydney's south in 2018.

He was found not guilty but had another brush with the law when he pleaded guilty to possessing a firearm.

The underworld figure was sentenced to three years in prison and walked free in September 2021.

Haunting covert recordings played in court during his sentencing revealed that Nazlioglu knew he was a marked man.

'I used to hear people outside were going to knock me, yeah?' he said while inside Sydney's Silverwater Prison in 2020, the Daily Telegraph reported.

'I used to still leave my house, brother, knowing that one day someone's going to sneak up on me and put one in my head.

'But I still f*****g went to the same hairdresser, went to the same f*****g restaurants yeah. I still showed my face in front yard and hung out with boys at their porches at their houses, yeah knowing I'm gunna get knocked one day.'

Bodies have been piling up in the Harbour City in the past 18 months with at least a dozen contract killings linked to the bitter feud between the Hamzy and Alameddine crime clans

The Australian that was raised by Turkish parents even bragged that he still visits the same mosque 'where all our enemies know we pray'.

'They could wait for us to walk out brother, did we s**t ourselves? Were we scared? No.'

While Nazlioglu was found not guilty by a jury of the hit on Hawi, his friend, furniture removalist Ahmad Doudar, 40, was jailed for four-and-a-half years.

Father-of-one Doudar was sentenced after admitting to being an accessory after the fact to Hawi's murder.

Doudar's role in the crime involved him picking up a hidden silver Aurion with a tow truck and intending to dispose of it, alongside others, the court heard.

Justice Robert Allan Hulme said on sentencing that '(Mr Doudar) intended to assist in disposing of the vehicle in order to assist' in the murder.

Nazlioglu, then 39, and alleged getaway driver Jamal El-Jaidi, then 32, were both found not guilty by a jury, following a week of deliberations.

Police responded after being called to Walker Street Rhodes after shots were fired (pictured)

Doudar, who accepted their involvement in the crime when making his plea, was not called to give evidence at their trial.

In sentencing Doudar for being an accessory, the judge said murders like this 'do not happen by chance... they require the involvement of multiple people.'

Doudar's motive remains unknown. 'For all I know, Mr Doudar may have been motivated by one or more other purposes,' the judge said.

Hawi's wife, Carolina Gonzalez, sister Zeinab and parents Ahmad and Nahdi read statements at his sentencing hearing.

They gave 'very moving accounts of the loss and grief that has resulted from the taking of their loved one in the most horrendous of circumstances.'

Doudar was jailed with a non parole period of three years and four months while Nazlioglu and El-Jaidi walked free.

Tasked with hunting for clues as to whether Jupiter's icy moons could host alien life, the six-tonne satellite will have to survive on as little power as a half a hair dryer as it makes an eight-year journey to our solar system's largest planet.

It will lift off from Europe's Spaceport in French Guiana at 13:15 BST today.

When Juice finally arrives at the Jovian system in 2031 it will make a series of flybys of Jupiter and its three large ocean-bearing moons Callisto, Europa and Ganymede, before performing a controlled crash into the latter when it runs out of fuel.

Here MailOnline breaks down everything you need to know about the exciting mission.

Ready for launch: The European Space Agency's Juice satellite (pictured) will lift off from Europe's Spaceport in French Guiana at 13:15 BST today

Juice will piggyback on an Ariane 5 rocket similar to the one that propelled the James Webb Space Telescope into orbit in December 2021.

It will launch from Europe's Spaceport in Kourou, French Guiana at 13:15 BST today.

If all goes to plan, Juice will separate from the upper stage of Ariane 5 at 13:42 BST, before sending its first signal down to the Earth's surface by 13:51 BST.

This will then allow mission crews to take control of the craft.

Why is it called Juice and what is its aim?

The spacecraft stands for JUpiter ICy moons Explorer.

It has cost £1.4 billion to build, a figure which included £9 million in funding from the UK Space Agency.

The satellite will make a 4.1 billion mile (6.6 billion km) trip to the Jovian system over a period of eight-and-a-half years, arriving at Jupiter in July 2031.

It will carry out 35 flybys of the gas giant's three moons before entering a permanent orbit around Ganymede in late 2034.

During its mission Juice will use an advanced suite of instruments to explore Jupiter and investigate whether any of the satellites that surround it are habitable.

Is it hunting for alien life?

Juice is not equipped to search for signs of life but its purpose is to explore the conditions that could support life.

Europa is the smallest of Jupiter's four Galilean moons but it is seen by most experts as the most likely to have the right ingredients for life.

Part of the reason for this is that beneath the ice crust of Europa is thought to lie a huge ocean of liquid water, containing twice as much water as Earth's oceans combined, which is heated up by tidal forces.

This is believed to create an internal circulation system which keeps waters moving and replenishes the icy surface on a regular basis.

Juice will explore Jupiter's moons Callisto, Europa and Ganymede (pictured in this graphic)

Mission plan: This graphic shows Juice's goals, firsts and the three Jupiter moons it will visit

Such a theory is significant because it means scientists would not necessarily have to delve deep into the underground ocean to find evidence of life, as the fact that the ocean floor interacts with the surface means it could throw up clues there.

'Of the Galilean satellites, Europa is the most likely [to have alien life] as the ocean is likely in contact with sand/rock according to models,' Professor Coates told MailOnline, 'whereas at Ganymede and Callisto the ocean floor would be ice due to lower temperature'.

However, for the purposes of the Juice mission, scientists are more interested in Ganymede.

Jupiter's largest moon is thought to have a salty ocean beneath its icy shell and one of Juice's key goals is to explore this body of water to determine whether the world may be habitable.

What instruments does Juice have?

Juice will carry 10 state-of-the-art instruments, including the most powerful remote sensing and geophysical tools ever flown to the outer solar system.

They include an optical camera system, UV imaging spectrograph, 'Moons and Jupiter Imaging Spectrometer', particle environment package and an instrument known as the 'Radar for Icy Moons Exploration'.

Jam packed: Juice will carry 10 state-of-the-art instruments, including the most powerful remote sensing and geophysical tools ever flown to the outer solar system. They are shown above

The spacecraft has been built to withstand harsh radiation and extreme conditions, ranging from 250C around Venus to minus 230C near Jupiter.

Its sensitive electronics are protected inside a pair of lead-lined vaults within the body of the probe, which is where the instruments will sit and collect data.

In effect, this area will act as a 'nuclear bunker' to shelter the electronics from radiation.

What is Britain's involvement?

Among the 10 instruments that Juice possesses is one that British scientists led the development of, while the UK Space Agency also injected £9 million of funding into the project.

Experts from Imperial College London helped create the magnetometer, known as J-MAG, which will measure the characteristics of the magnetic fields of Jupiter and Ganymede.

It will also play a key role in detecting moving salts in the oceans beneath Europa, Callisto and Ganymede.

Scientists hope the data from the latter will allow them to establish the depth and salt content of Ganymede's ocean to see if it may hold the conditions for life.

Professor Michele Dougherty, head of the Department of Physics at Imperial College London and principal investigator for J-MAG, said: 'With our instrument's measurements, we are almost looking inside these worlds.

'What we're doing however is extremely difficult, as the signals we're trying to detect are extremely small.

'It's like trying to find lots of needles in a haystack, and those needles are changing shape and colour all the time.

'But we think the results are going to be spectacular.'

UCL's Mullard Space Science Laboratory (MSSL), along with the Open University, also have science roles in Juice's optical camera system called Janus.

Dr Chiaki Crews, research fellow at The Open University, said: 'The Juice mission aims to answer many exciting questions, including whether the ocean worlds beneath the surfaces of Jupiter's icy moons could potentially harbour life.

'One of the many instruments needed to make detailed scientific observations to help answer such questions is a camera.

Tough: The spacecraft has been built to withstand harsh radiation and extreme conditions, ranging from 250C around Venus to minus 230C near Jupiter

Preparation: Engineers and mission controllers have a very short launch window to send the spacecraft on its journey

'A large part of our work was to irradiate test sensors with high doses of radiation, just like it is expected to experience during the Juice mission lifetime, to check that Janus will still be able to take images without too much degradation.'

ESA will also be assisted in its work by NASA, and the space agencies of Japan and Israel.

Why is it so tricky to get to Jupiter?

Just reaching Jupiter is difficult in itself. The closer you get to the gas giant and the longer you want to stay in its vicinity, the harder it becomes.

The enormous world is five times farther away from the sun than Earth, meaning it receives just 4 per cent of the sunlight that our planet gets.

The knock-on effect is that any spacecraft visiting the twilight zone where it exists has to have huge solar arrays if it is to rely on solar power.

Engineers and mission controllers also have a very short launch window if they are to get a probe to reach Jupiter, which is a key consideration for Juice.

This is because Venus and Earth need to be in the perfect position for Juice to perform a manoeuvre known as gravitational assist, where it will use the gravity of these planets to slingshot towards Jupiter.

Once Juice (pictured in an artist's impression) runs out of fuel, it will perform a controlled crash into Ganymede, marking the end of the mission

Launch plan: This graphic shows the build up to lift-off of Juice and its first few days in space

Justin Byrne, head of science for Airbus and the mission's lead contractor, said that despite having three-and-a-half tonnes of fuel, it is not enough for Juice to get to Jupiter directly.

He said: 'We have to use planets – Earth and Venus – just to get to Jupiter.

'We will minimise the amount of fuel we need to use by using gravitational support.'

However, if the first window is missed Mr Byrne said there will be more opportunities in April, and then later in August.

What will follow Juice?

The European satellite will later be joined by NASA's Europa Clipper spacecraft in its mission to explore Jupiter's moons.

Although Juice and Europa Clipper have different priorities, there will be opportunities for the two to collaborate.",ESA's Juice mission: How to watch as spacecraft is launched to Jupiter and its moons,0

Paedophile Cowan, who was jailed for life for murdering schoolboy Daniel, tells guards which prisoners he is afraid of so they are not placed in his unit at Wolston jail near Brisbane, the Courier-Mail reported.

Despite changing his appearance - growing his hair out into a ponytail, sporting a beard and wearing glasses - he still can't walk around the prison alone, an officer said.

Daniel Morcombe's murderer Brett Cowan lives in a constant state of terror behind bars and fears he will be killed by vigilante inmates

Daniel vanished from a bus stop on Queensland 's Sunshine Coast in 2003, aged 13.

'He's doing absolutely nothing (inside),' the prison source said.

'He flags anyone that he's scared of or think doesn't like him. He tells intel. They flag the other crim and then they can't be moved into that unit.'

Cowan is right to be afraid. In 2016, he had a hot bucket of water over his head by a vengeful inmate.

He was stabbed in the neck with a sharpened toothbrush in 2018 and was punched in the head last year.

The child abuser has been locked up since his arrest in 2011 over the murder of Daniel, who vanished from a bus stop on Queensland's Sunshine Coast in 2003, aged 13.

Paedophile Cowan tells guards which prisoners he is afraid of so they are not placed in his unit at Wolston jail

He was convicted in 2014 and was jailed for life with a non-parole period of 20 years, meaning he could walk free in 2031.

Daniel's father Bruce Morcombe said he was glad Cowan lived in fear in prison.

'I'm actually pleased that he is required, all of these years later, to sleep with one eye open and that jail time is not easy for him. I think that's perhaps a little bit of natural justice,' he said.",Brett Cowan: Paedophile who murdered Daniel Morcombe lives in a constant state of fear behind bars and 'can't walk around alone' because he's scared he'll be attacked,0

Biden will also propose that billionaires would need to pay a minimum of 25% in federal taxes on their income as he targets the super wealthy like Jeff Bezos and Elon Musk.

Another person who will be affected by his plans is his 2024 rival Donald Trump, who relies on his private jet - Trump Force One - to campaign across the country. Biden uses the military jet Air Force One for his travel.

Brainard noted the president will be 'fighting for working people and middle class families like the ones he grew up with in Scranton. The President will continue to put the middle class first as he lays out his plan for the American economy.'

The sweeping tax increases are targeted at bringing down the U.S. deficit but also raising Biden's poll numbers as he heads into the November election. Polls show Trump in the lead - by a narrow margin - with eight months until Election Day.

Voters give Biden low marks for his handling of the economy. And Trump has hammered Biden repeatedly on the high rate of inflation that has raised food and fuel prices for consumers.

The president's proposals will also affect some of his allies: John Kerry, his former climate adviser, uses a private jet. So do celebrities like Taylor Swift and Leonardo DiCaprio, who support the president.

Biden will propose increasing the fuel tax on corporate and private jet travel and changing depreciation rules.

https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2023/sep/22/county-cricket-surrey-v-northants-essex-v-hampshire-and-more-live,0,"22 Sept 2023 19.45 BST Roundup: Hampshire win leaves Essex hopes in ruins An outrageous Hampshire run-chase at Chelmsford, steered by James Vince and Liam Dawson, stamped a great boot through Essex’s chances of challenging for the County Championship title. Defeat, with five balls to spare, leaves Essex 20 points behind Surrey with one game left. Essex had chased quick morning runs – Sir Alastair Cook out for an ungainly 16 – setting Hampshire 267. This looked unlikely at 32 for four when Dawson and Vince came together, Simon Harmer fizzing in from the River End. But the pair intelligently harvested 184 for the fifth wicket, taking Hampshire close enough for their teammates to do the rest. Meanwhile, at the Oval, Rory Burns (71) and Dom Sibley (67) pulled out their best tweed jackets and batted out the day, after Surrey followed on for the first time in 2023. When the rain came just after tea, the pavilion stood in happy applause for their openers. Northamptonshire, who fought to the last, will be playing Division Two cricket next year. The battle for the other relegation place goes into the final round with Kent surviving at Taunton, but not without palpitations. Left just a day to bat in a rain-affected match, after Somerset declared overnight, they were soon 31 for four, taken to respectability only by 73 from Joe Denly and some stoicism from the late middle order. Denly’s exit precipitated three wickets for a song. Eventually bowled out for 235, Tom Abell four for 52, they followed on, but survived. Middlesex were not so lucky, despite a second century of the year from Sam Robson, a seven-hour sterling effort, and go into the final strait one point behind Kent. Worcestershire will need a maximum of three points against Yorkshire next week to guarantee promotion, Scott Borthwick’s hundred the highlight of their damp draw with Durham. Their nearest rivals, Leicestershire, were thwarted by Yorkshire and the rain, and seem likely to lose a bonus point for a slow over-rate. Share

22 Sept 2023 18.50 BST Till Tuesday They’ve shut up shop at The Oval, quiet now after every run Hampshire scored was roared on from the Surrey dressing-room. With just a round to go, the reigning champions supper happily, 20 points ahead – though they must now face crusher-of-dreams Hampshire. Essex are heartbroken, though not mathematically out of it; Durham champions; Northants relegated; Worcestershire nearly there and a scrap to end all scraps about to be unleashed between Middlesex and Kent to avoid the final relegation spot. We’ll be back next Tuesday for it all, in the final round of another brilliant campaign. Until then, good evening!

For the four-day Senate trial that ended in his acquittal, Trump’s campaign committee, which has since been renamed the Make America Great Again PAC, paid $580,000 to the Philadelphia law firm of Bruce Castor and Michael van der Veen and another $100,000 to Alabama-based lawyer David Schoen, according to filings released Saturday.

Former President Trump paid lawyers who defended him in his second impeachment trial nearly $700,000, filings with the Federal Election Commission show

Trump announced the trio would represent him only a week before the trial.

After the House voted in favor of impeachment, the defense lawyers first filed a 78-page brief that denounced the impeachment case as partisan ‘political theater,’ and then moved to debate the constitutionality of whether the former president could be tried by the Senate, which the Senate agreed he could.

Trump’s defense lawyers and House impeachment managers then presented their case over three days. The defense used only three hours to present its case, where managers used 10.

The Senate ultimately rejected the article of impeachment for ‘incitement of an insurrection’ on Feb. 13 as it fell short of the two-thirds majority needed to convict.

Trump’s campaign spent only $8.6 million challenging election results, drawing speculation as to whether he’s saving the cash to bolster his favorite candidates in 2022 or for another potential shot at the presidency in 2024

‘Anyone who listened to President Trump’s legal team saw they were unfocused, they attempted to avoid the issue, and they talked about everything but the issue at hand,’ Louisiana Republican Sen. Bill Cassidy said on Feb. 8, after the first day of arguments.

Trump’s political groups have over $100 million cash on hand, and raised $82 million in the first six months of 2021 alone. The former president had also raised a little more than $31 million last year as he told donors he needed money to challenge the 2020 election, which he falsely said had been stolen from him.

Trump’s campaign spent only $8.6 million challenging election results, drawing speculation as to whether he’s saving the cash to bolster his favorite candidates in 2022 or for another potential shot at the presidency in 2024.

'These things cost money,' Trump spokesman Jason Miller said of the second impeachment trial. He argued that the impeachment had been aimed at preventing Trump from mounting another run in the future.

'While this partisan charade was soundly defeated, and President Trump was completely exonerated, these things cost money,' Miller told Bloomberg.

The shock-jock turned TV host said the Premier's press conference appearances have turned 'negative, aggressive and almost bad-tempered'.

'Gladys, people have stopped listening to you and this daily dose of rubbish,' Jones said.

'We are not in this together. The political and bureaucratic class collect full salary while inflicting devastation on others.

'A decent person would feel some sense of shame.'

In the same breath, Jones also took a brutal swipe at Western Australian Premier Mark McGowan, who has insisted on a hard-line Covid policy.

'Over in WA we've got this power-drunk premier McGowan pursuing a zero transmission strategy,' Jones said.

The issue of doing away with Covid lockdowns and interstate border closures has been a hot-button political topic over the past 48 hours after Mr McGowan broke ranks with the national cabinet's stance.

The Western Australia Premier said his state would not hesitate to shut its border with the rest of Australia if future Covid cases emerge - even if national vaccine targets are reached.

His comments ignited a war of words with Scott Morrison who lashed out at Mr McGowan's Covid-zero plan, saying it is unreasonable and would hurt the economy.

'What happens in Phase B when you hit 70 per cent, which is based on the best medical and economic advice available to all leaders in Australia... once you hit those levels, it is neither in our health or economic interests to be going down that path,' the Prime Minister said.

'The national plan that everyone has signed up to, it's actually a commitment they've made to the Australian people and people in their own states about the pathway out.

'That pathway out is important, because it's encouraging people to get vaccinated, and so to run down the plan is to actually undermine the vaccination program.'

Mr McGowan on Monday returned fire outlining a different interpretation of the national plan, projected by the Doherty Institute.

'I've got the roadmap here. It says lockdowns at 80 per cent, just so you know,' the Premier said.

'I think people need to read it.

'It says lockdowns are possible at 80 per cent vaccination. It says the same thing at 70 per cent vaccination.'",Gladys Berejiklian destroyed by Alan Jones who demands embattled premier resign over Covid lockdown,0

On the docket: Trump in trouble (and seven jurors)

It only took one day for Donald Trump to land in hot water with judge Juan Merchan.

Immediately after a potential juror exited the courtroom after being questioned by Trump’s attorney about her social media posts, Merchan said that he could hear Trump “muttering” while she had been standing less than 12ft away from him – and issued a stern warning to the former president.

“It was audible. He was gesturing and he was speaking in the direction of the juror,” a visibly irritated Merchan told Trump’s attorney, raising his voice. “I will not have any jurors intimidated in this courtroom.”



He then directed Trump’s attorney, Todd Blanche, to speak to Trump about his behavior.

The exchange was one of the testier moments in the first full day of jury selection for Trump’s first criminal trial, as Trump’s attorney tried to remove any potential jurors who had displayed negative views of the former president. Merchan rejected many of those efforts – “The question is not whether someone agrees with your client politically or not. The question is whether or not they can be fair and impartial,” Merchan told Blanche at one point – but he did agree to dismiss a few, including a prospective juror who had previously called for Trump to be jailed.

By the end of the day, the original pool of 96 potential jurors had been whittled down dramatically. More than half had been excused on Monday. The prosecution and defense each used a few of their own “peremptory challenges” (each side gets ten challenges to remove a potential juror without giving a reason) to remove a dozen more.

Out of that pool, six jurors were chosen. Merchan swore them in this afternoon, and told them to expect to return for the trial’s opening statements as soon as Monday morning. After a few more hours of questioning, and right before adjourning for the day, he swore in a seventh.

In a motion filed on Tuesday, prosecutors argue that Trump should be held in contempt because he “wilfully violated” Merchan’s gag order which bars Trump from making public statements about potential witnesses by publishing several social media posts attacking his former attorney Michael Cohen and Stormy Daniels, the porn star with whom he allegedly had an affair.

The prosecutors write that it’s “absolutely critical” to stop Trump from violating the gag order in order to “protect the integrity of the ongoing trial.”

“A finding of criminal contempt, imposition of sanctions, and stark warnings from this court are the minimum remedies necessary to achieve this indispensable objective,” they continue.

Trump called Cohen and Daniels “sleazebags” in a social media post on 10 April, after Merchan issued his gag order, and then on 13 April referred to Cohen as a “disgraced attorney and felon”.

The filing came after prosecutors requested during Monday’s pretrial proceedings that Merchan hold Trump in contempt and fine him $1,000 for each social media post. The judge gave Trump’s attorneys until Friday to respond, and has scheduled a hearing for next Tuesday morning to determine whether he’ll issue sanctions.

Down in DC, the US supreme court heard oral arguments on a case that could have huge ramifications for Trump’s own federal election interference criminal trial – and justices expressed skepticism that some of the charges that have been leveled against Trump in that case should be allowed.

Russian forces seized a Ukrainian seaport and besieged another today as they tried to cut off the country from its coastline while Vladimir Putin's invasion continues.

The Russian military said it had control of Kherson, a Black Sea port of 280,000 people, making it the first major city to fall since the invasion began a week ago.

Elsewhere, the Russians pressed their offensive on multiple fronts, but a column of tanks appeared to have been stalled for days outside Kyiv. And the European Union said it had seen signs online that Russia could introduce martial law in the country.

Ukraine said Russia's forces have so far suffered 9,000 casualties in the fighting. Russia said yesterday that nearly 500 troops have been killed and 1,600 wounded.

And Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov today warned that World War Three would be 'nuclear', while the Ukrainian city of Odessa was braced for an assault.

But Moscow's isolation deepened as most of the world demanded it withdraw from Ukraine and the UK said it was 'fast-forwarding sanctions' against oligarchs.

Ukraine said more than 2,000 civilians have died, while the United Nations refugee agency revealed that one million people have fled the country since the invasion.

A second round of 'peace talks' aimed at ending the fighting in eastern Europe was expected to take place today, but there were little hopes of a breakthrough.

And an International Criminal Court war crimes investigation has begun after Boris Johnson accused Mr Putin of committing atrocities by bombarding cities.

Meanwhile Ikea became the latest firm to halt operations in Russia as it temporarily shut all stores and factories in the country in a move impacting 15,000 workers.

The comedian hit out at 24-hour cable news networks, and especially CNN, in a three-minute, profanity-laced rant on Thursday's episode of Burr's 'Monday Morning Podcast'.

'I can't believe people watch that channel,' Burr said. 'They want Darth Vader to come back because they got nothing to talk about because it's show business, and Joe Biden is a f*****g bore.

'So now what do they do? They’re doing what they did the first time to get this guy elected by giving him all this free coverage while they act like they allegedly don’t like him. I don’t buy it. They are a corporate news channel.

WARNING: GRAPHIC LANGUAGE

Comedian Bill Burr - pictured here hosting SNL in October 2020 - ripped CNN and cable news shows on his podcast on Thursday

Since Donald Trump - pictured here speaking during the Texas CPAC last week - left office, CNN's ratings and audience have plummeted

Burr has been hosting this podcast since 2007 and talks about what is on his mind at the time.

He says on his website, 'None of his opinions are based on any sort of reliable information. He tends to go with his first thought, because reading makes him sleepy.'

In this case, he talked about a subject that seems to be backed by numbers.

The Biden administration seemingly zapped CNN's audiences.

Last Thursday, the network didn’t have a single program surpass the 1-million viewer plateau, and averaged only 654,000 viewers during the second quarter of 2021, Fox News reported.

The Washington Times reported in late June that CNN as a whole lost 44 percent of its total audience since the last week of January when ratings peaked following the insurrection of the Capitol.

All of the cable news networks saw year-over-year ratings decline for the second quarter of 2021, but CNN's 57-percent drop was the biggest prime time loss among the cable news networks.

Fox News declined by 42 percent, and MSNBC dropped by 37 percent, Forbes reported.

In the second quarter of 2021, Fox was the top-rated network on basic cable, according to the Nielson ratings.

Burr has been hosting the 'Monday Morning Podcast' since 2007

Burr continued to rip all cable news channels - not just CNN - for running negative stories about wildfires, race relations and COVID-19.

'They got to make you feel like s**t. You got to scare the hell out of them. You got to make them feel like they have a virus, their house is going to burn down and the Nazis are coming. Those are the tentpoles that make for a great half hour of news,' Burr said.

He said he wants to see a two to one ratio of negative stories to positive stories.

They will come within about half a degree of each other – roughly one full moon's width apart (or the equivalent of the width of your pinkie when held out at arm's length) – and look like they are about to collide.

It could provide a stunning spectacle for stargazers, who may be able to see the event without a telescope or binoculars.

For the past few weeks, Jupiter and Venus have been inching nearer to each other as they move towards what is known as a conjunction — when two objects in the sky such as moons, planets or stars appear very close.

Although the worlds will seem like they are side by side, the phenomenon is actually a trick of perspective - in reality they are still 400 million miles (600 million km) apart.

Quite the spectacle: Jupiter and Venus will share a rare 'cosmic kiss' tonight, as the two planets appear side by side in the night sky

The worlds will come within about half a degree of each other – roughly one full moon's width apart – and look like they are about to collide. To catch a glimpse of this, skywatchers should look to the west after sunset (pictured)

It is only from Earth that they will seemingly enjoy a 'cosmic kiss'.

What is a conjunction? For the past few weeks, Jupiter and Venus have been inching nearer to each other as they move towards what is known as a conjunction — when two objects in the sky such as moons, planets or stars appear very close. Conjunctions like this are common in our solar system because 'the planets orbit around the sun in approximately the same plane - the ecliptic plane - and thus trace similar paths across our sky', NASA said. So while there is 'no profound astronomical significance', as the US space agency puts it, 'they are nice to view'. Thanks to the relatively short orbit of Venus (225 days), paired with Jupiter's 12-year journey around the sun, the pair reach conjunction roughly every 13 months. Advertisement

To catch a glimpse of this, skywatchers should look to the west after sunset in search of what will look like two exceptionally bright stars.

Jupiter will shine twice as bright as Sirius – the brightest star in the sky – while Venus will appear six times brighter than the gas giant, which is the largest planet in the solar system.

Because the worlds will be low-lying on the horizon, finding a spot on a hill and away from tall buildings will provide a better view.

NASA said the two planets would appear around 18:58 ET, as evening twilight ends on the east coast of the US.

A similar sort of time in the UK will provide the best opportunity to catch a glimpse of the spectacle.

The only hindrance could be cloud cover, as a dark sky is obviously the best way to spot the event.

Unfortunately, most of Britain is expected to be blanketed with cloud from 19:00 GMT this evening, although those in the south west of England and west of Wales should have relatively clear skies to allow them to watch the conjunction.

Spectators may also be able to spot four of Jupiter's brightest moons with the help of a telescope.

After our own moon, Jupiter and Venus are currently the brightest objects in the sky, according to Gianluca Masi, an astronomer at the Bellatrix Astronomical Observatory in Italy and head of the Virtual Telescope Project.

He is hosting a live feed from 18:30 GMT (13:30 ET) to watch 'the kiss between Venus and Jupiter', for those who cannot see it in person.

Show-off: Venus will appear six times brighter than the gas giant, which is the largest planet in the solar system

'A conjunction involving planets Venus and Jupiter is always spectacular: after the moon, they are the brightest objects in the night sky,' Masi said.

Four fights broke out and three teachers were assaulted while Executive Head Adam Price and a fellow teacher, identified only as Person B, stripped off to ‘engage in sexual activities.

There was outrage this week when the Teaching Regulation Agency allowed Mr Price, 40, to continue in his profession despite the stain on his copybook.

In not banning him from teaching again, Duncan Tilley, who chaired the hearing, said: ‘The panel noted Mr Price's insight into his misconduct and the consequences of it. He expressed remorse that appeared to the panel to be genuine.

'The devastating impact that his conduct had had on him and his family led the panel to conclude that the risk of repetition was low.

Executive Head Adam Price (pictured) and a fellow teacher stripped off to 'engage in sexual activities' as fights broke out in his school

'The panel considered whether it would be proportionate to conclude this case with no recommendation of prohibition, considering whether the publication of the findings made by the panel would be sufficient.'

Mr Price was in charge of Northern House School Academy Trust, a pupil referral unit in Wolverhampton, when the incident occurred on January 27 2020.

The hearing was told that on the day three members of staff were absent and that ‘Person B’ had cancelled one staff member’s off-site training to fill the gaps.

But she then joined Mr Price in his office for a three hours and 50 minutes during which time fellow staff members were assaulted and four fights broke out between pupils.

Their shocking behaviour and secret affair came to light a month later, after anonymous letters were sent to the school prompting Mr Price to resign in disgrace.

Duncan Tilley told the hearing in Coventry 'Mr Price was referred to the TRA on 20 February 2020.

'It was reported that two anonymous letters had been received by the school which had questioned the behaviour of Mr Price and another member of staff, Person B, including the nature of their relationship.

'One of those letters questioned what they had been doing during the day in Mr Price's office when pupils and other staff were on site.

'A review of CCTV footage for 27 January 2020 was undertaken which revealed that Mr Price and Person B had been engaging in sexual activities in Mr Price's office that day.'

The married headteacher spent 3 hours and 50 minutes in his office with Person B where they engaged in sexual activities

He added: 'Mr Price admitted that on 27 January 2020 he and Person B were together in his office for much of the working day; approximately 3 hours 50 minutes in total.

'During this time, Mr Price admitted that he and Person B engaged in sexual activities and there were periods of time when Mr Price and Person B were unclothed.

'The panel heard that on the day in question there had been three assaults on staff and four separate fights between pupils.

'The referral document also stated that three members of staff who worked in the school were off that day and that, because of this, Person B had requested additional cover and cancelled one employee's scheduled off site training.'

Mr Price also admitted breaching Northern House School's 'Relationships at Work' Policy by failing to declare a personal relationship with Person B.

The panel turned down Mr Price’s application for anonymity but stopped short of banning him from teaching.

It recommended no teaching ban as Mr Price had a previous good history and had made a valuable contribution to the profession, working with challenging pupils.

John Knowles, speaking for the Education Secretary, said: 'In the light of the panel's findings against Mr Price, there was a public interest consideration in respect of the protection of pupils, given that in acting as he did on the day concerned, he failed to place the safety and welfare of children above all considerations.

'However, based on all of the evidence presented, the panel concluded that the risk to pupils arising from his conduct was not significant.'",PICTURED: Married headteacher who had sex with a colleague for four hours in his office,0

The Parole Board said it granted an application made by lawyers for Bronson - one of the UK's longest-serving prisoners - to request his latest case review is heard in public.

Dubbed one of Britain's most violent offenders, Bronson - who changed his surname to Salvador in 2014 after the artist Salvador Dali - has been in prison for much of the last 50 years, often spending time in solitary confinement or specialist units.

It is believed he is still being held at high-security HMP Woodhill in Milton Keynes.

Bronson, who turns 70 next month, has previously said he was first sent to jail in 1968 and has held 11 hostages in nine different sieges - with victims including governors, doctors, staff and, on one occasion, his own solicitor.

He was sentenced in 2000 to a discretionary life term with a minimum of four years for taking a prison teacher at HMP Hull hostage for 44 hours.

Since then the Parole Board has repeatedly refused to direct his release.

In a document setting out the decision for a public hearing, Parole Board chairwoman Caroline Corby said: 'I have concluded that a public hearing is in the interests of justice in the case of Mr Salvador.

'I therefore grant the application for the hearing to be held in public.'

Bronson's case is yet to be listed and a date for the hearing has not been set but the Parole Board said it is expected to take place early next year.

The Parole Board said it granted an application made by lawyers for Bronson - one of the UK's longest-serving prisoners - to request his latest case review is heard in public

The 66-year-old was the first prisoner to formally ask for a public hearing after the rules changed earlier this year to allow the public and press to observe proceedings, in a bid to remove the secrecy around the parole process.

Russell Causley, who murdered his wife, Carole Packman, in the 1980s and never revealed where he hid her body, is set to become the first prisoner in UK history to have a public Parole Board hearing.

He was freed in 2020 but sent back to jail last year after breaching his licence conditions.

The hearing, originally listed for October, was adjourned and is now expected to take place next month.

Two other applications for cases to be heard in public have been rejected and three are still being considered, the Parole Board said.

In 2018, Bronson's wife, Paula Williamson, was found dead aged just 38 next to cocaine and tablets after a suspected drug overdose.

The former Coronation Street actress was found by her new lover at her home in Stoke-on-Trent.

It is believed that her new boyfriend, whom she had only been seeing for a couple of weeks, phoned emergency services but medics pronounced her dead.

Ms Williamson married Bronson at HMP Wakefield in West Yorkshire in November 2017. The criminal was handcuffed to the warder for two hours during the ceremony.

But their relationship quickly fell apart and Bronson was left outraged by a photograph of the actress with a man's head in her breasts on holiday in Tenerife.

The couple's marriage had been set to be annulled before Ms Williamson's death.","Charles Bronson, 69, will have his latest bid for freedom held in public, Parole Board says",0

Imperial College professor warned lockdowns could occur in future outbreaks

Oxford University is racing to test a vaccine made from a chimpanzee virus

UK Government is unveiling 'whack-a-mole' lockdown exit strategy to public

Here’s how to help people impacted by Covid-19

A professor at Imperial College London claims there may never be a coronavirus vaccine and that governments will be left to respond to future outbreaks of the pathogen with regional or national lockdowns.

Dr David Nabarro, a special envoy to the World Health Organisation (WHO) on Covid-19, said no 'absolute assumption' can be made 'that a vaccine will appear at all'.

The global health professor argued that 'high hopes' are 'dashed' because scientists are 'dealing with biological systems, we're not dealing with mechanical systems'.

He added that restrictions to movement 'may apply to parts of a country, or it may even apply to a whole country' in the face of another outbreak.

Dr Nabarro's intervention comes as the British public increasingly turn to scientists under huge pressure to develop a vaccine for an end to the pandemic.

Already a team at Oxford University are racing to test a vaccine made from a chimpanzee virus. In the US, scientists are trying a different vaccine.

Ministers have signalled that the quarantining of the elderly would only occur if a vaccine were developed. It is estimated this could take at least one year.

Dr Nabarro, who has warned that people can expect to wear face masks in the future, told CNN:' There are some viruses that we still do not have vaccines against.

'We can't make an absolute assumption that a vaccine will appear at all, or if it does appear, whether it will pass all the tests of efficacy and safety.

'You have high hopes, and then your hopes are dashed.

'We're dealing with biological systems, we're not dealing with mechanical systems. It really depends so much on how the body reacts.'

Dr Nabarro suggested that lockdowns, many of which are in the process of gradually being lifted by governments, could be implemented at any moment.

'From time to time there will be outbreaks,' he said. 'Movement will be restricted and that may apply to parts of a country, or it may even apply to a whole country.'

Michael Gove told a coronavirus press briefing of the Government's so-called 'whack-a-mole' policy, which involves gradually easing the lockdown.

Restrictions can be quickly snapped back into effect in light of future outbreaks.

Imperial College London encouraged the Government to pursue a lockdown after it projected that half a million people could die if no action was taken.

It has led to the furloughing of millions of workers and the closure of huge swathes of the economy - chiefly in food, retail, hospitality, travel, and manufacturing.

Cabinet Ministers are quick to say that the lockdown has saved lives. So far, no concrete proof backing the claim has been presented.

Meanwhile, economists have estimated that the policy could be costing Britain £2.4billion per day. Others say the economic crisis is the most severe in 100 years.

A Bank of England official recently warned that the UK economy is facing an extreme contraction, the likes of which may not have been felt in centuries.

The spiralling crisis has led to the repeated intervention of Lord Sumption, one of Britain's most distinguished historians and jurists.

In a piece for the Mail on Sunday, Lord Sumption called the continued locking up of the elderly a 'cruel mockery of basic human values'.

He criticised the Government's 'blind panic following the delivery of Imperial College London's Professor Neil Ferguson's statistical projections'.

Lord Sumption also took to task the 'money question'. 'People decry attempts to measure the mortality of Covid-19 against the economic cost of reducing it,' he writes. 'But this too is rhetoric, and hypocritical rhetoric at that.

Each wore a black, hooded top and had covered his face with a scarf or surgical mask. Having gained entrance to the premises, they swaggered to the back of the store and began aggressively pulling high-end puffer jackets off a clothing rack.

An eighth gang member, acting as the lookout, propped the glass front door open while keeping an eye on the increasingly terrified shop assistant.

It took exactly 40 seconds for his accomplices to finish ransacking the shop. Then they rushed outside and sprinted into the darkness of Chiswick High Road, carrying stolen clothing worth an astonishing £25,000-£30,000.

The raid, which took place shortly before closing time on Tuesday, February 6, is part of a dramatic crime wave that began sweeping through this ultra-fashionable corner of our capital city roughly six months ago.

Barely a day goes by without a fresh report of some feral gang striding into a local store and casually making off with thousands of pounds worth of stock. CCTV of their heists, including dozens of films obtained by the Daily Mail, show how they combine calculated menace with staggering impunity.

They then begin aggressively pulling high-end puffer jackets off a clothing rack

Just 48 hours before the raid on Riccado, three men strode into a branch of Boots 400 yards away and casually smashed a glass display cabinet holding perfume. They threw thousands of pounds-worth of scent into large holdalls before walking out.

‘They did not bother to even cover their faces completely,’ says a witness, who uploaded footage to Facebook. ‘The security guard was cut and bleeding.’

In January, the local branch of Vision Express lost £8,000 worth of designer spectacles in a single raid. The previous month, a photography store called Chiswick Camera Centre announced that it was henceforth keeping stock in metal cages, after equipment worth £70,000 was taken in two robberies six months apart.

Almost every local clothing shop, including chains such as Whistles and Jigsaw, now operates a ‘locked door’ policy, in which shoppers must ring a bell to gain entry.

Many also now employ full-time security guards and have installed panic buttons under the till to allow terrified staff to summon help. Many stores roll down their shutters and close for business the moment darkness falls, having decided that it’s too dangerous to offer evening shopping.

Perhaps inevitably, a small but growing number of retailers, in what was once one of Britain’s most vibrant shopping streets, are deciding to board up their front windows and shut down for good. Only last week, menswear shop American Pie closed its doors for the final time.

All of which raises two interrelated questions.

Firstly, how did ultra-modish Chiswick, where terraced houses start at £2million and an outpost of £2,750-a-year members’ club Soho House caters for celebrity residents from Colin Firth and David Tennant to Richard Osman and Sophie Ellis-Bextor, find itself on the front line of Britain’s spiralling shoplifting epidemic?

Chiswick, where terraced houses start at £2million, finds itself on the front line of Britain’s spiralling shoplifting epidemic

Secondly, where exactly, during this astonishing breakdown in law and order, have the police been?

One way to answer both conundrums is to visit the Riccado fashion boutique, where this month’s heist took place.

Here, the manager - whose late father-in-law opened the premises more than 30 years ago - agreed to speak on condition of anonymity, fearing reprisals from gangs. We shall call her Siobhan.

In the chaotic moments after the raid on her store, Siobhan was telephoned by the traumatised shop assistant, one of seven people her business directly employs. She advised him to shut up shop and go home for the night to recover. The following morning, she reported the incident to the police.

‘I told them we had CCTV,’ she says. ‘You could clearly see the faces of some of the kids, so perhaps they could have found them. There would have been fingerprints all over the place as well, since none of them were wearing gloves. It was a big robbery, and we’d lost tens of thousands of pounds-worth of kit. So I expected someone to come round.’

But instead of a helpful knock on the door from detectives, Siobhan received a return visit from the gang.

‘Five of them came back in the middle of the following day. We had locked the door, and were only letting in customers who looked genuine, so they couldn’t get in. They stood outside, lurking around the trees.’

This might have offered police a second chance to apprehend suspects. But again, officers failed to visit. The gang meanwhile began turning up on a regular basis, usually just as it was getting dark. Fearing that they might follow a genuine customer into the store, and once more steal huge quantities of stock, Siobhan began closing the premises each day at 4.30pm.

Eventually Siobhan heard back from the police on February 14, eight days after the original raid. Their response was extraordinary. ‘They called and said: “Do you want to do this over the phone, take a witness report?” she recalls. ‘I replied: “No, you need to come in.” The person calling went, “Yeah, I suppose it was a value item,” and I was like “are you kidding? This was a gang robbery! They took £30,000 worth of kit.”’

When the officers finally turned up, she was told that it was ‘too late’ to take forensic evidence (‘You don’t say!’) but Siobhan passed over a USB stick containing CCTV footage, taken from a number of cameras.

Given the Met’s evident lack of interest in doing the most basic detective work, the gang continued to loiter outside the boutique

Siobhan said: 'They stood outside, lurking around the trees’

The police then promised to return the following morning to take a statement from the assistant who had witnessed the crime. But they never showed up. And although they had the man’s number, they failed to telephone him.

A day later, an email pinged into the store’s inbox. It came from the Metropolitan Police, and the contents were scandalous.

‘An investigator … has looked carefully at your case and we are sorry to say that with the evidence and leads available it is unlikely that we will be able to identify those responsible,’ the message read. ‘We have therefore closed this case.’

Perhaps inevitably, given the Met’s evident lack of interest in doing the most basic detective work, the gang continued to loiter outside the boutique.

Things culminated last Thursday, when eight of them attempted to gain entrance, in scenes also recorded on CCTV, by trying to kick down the shop’s front door, damaging its frame and shattering glass.

‘We put the shutters down to stop them getting in, and I rang 999 and said a gang, who might be armed, was right now trying to break into my shop.’

Again, the report was met with an extraordinary response. ‘The operator told me that someone would be in touch in the next 48 hours. Did any police officer bother to come out? No.’

Riccado now shuts its doors the moment dusk falls, and has stopped selling the ‘Moose Knuckle’ brand, whose £1,500 jackets were targeted in the original raid.

‘My door is being kicked down by a gang, and the police aren’t willing to send someone out,’ says Siobhan. ‘It’s terrible. Apart from being incredibly dangerous, it's damaging to our business. We are a small company.

'We don’t have any other shops. So when the stock gets stolen, we just aren’t covered for it and £30,000 is a lot. Of course, they also smashed our door in, which I’ve had to pay for as well.’

Siobhan isn’t alone. During our interview, she showed me a WhatsApp group called Shopwatch Chiswick, in which about 40 local retailers share photos and CCTV footage of shoplifting incidents to warn other stores. It showed that organised gangs are now targeting local stores on a daily basis.

The gang tried to kick down the shop’s front door, damaging its frame and shattering glass

Last Sunday, the group responsible for kicking down Siobhan’s door raided the local Halfords. ‘They were on e-scooters, and nearly knocked over an old lady as they drove off,’ said one retailer.

Other posts warned that the local outpost of Hotel Chocolat had been targeted (‘Each box of chocolates is worth £20 to £40, and they can scoop up a load in one go, so these people come in, they have someone waiting outside, they give them a whole load and that person cycles off,’) along with Mountain Warehouse (‘people are just walking out with four jackets at a time’).

Then there were hair-raising discussions involving a £5,000 raid on Boots on January 24, in which photos of the perpetrators ended up on a local website called The Chiswick Calendar.

‘Footage of the incident shows one culprit, a white male dressed in a navy cap, black puffer jacket, black Adidas joggers and grey Nike trainers, crouching and scooping products into a Sainsbury’s bag while the shop’s alarm blares in the background,’ the site reported.

‘Both men made no attempt to hide their face and one could be heard singing as he stole items. They ran out of the shop at about 3.22pm. Police were called but hadn’t arrived by 6pm.’

Other recent heists reported in local newspapers include an August account of an incident at Jigsaw in which a rail of jackets and silk shirts worth £2,000 was taken. The store manager, Natalie, pressed a panic button but police took 45 minutes to turn up.

‘They said they had to come from Feltham because there’s no police facility here any more. By the time they arrived I had resolved everything and the police were just basically...laughing.’

Then there was an incident in September in which a gang of four Romanian women walked into the upmarket yoga and leisure-wear store Sweaty Betty, and swiped a suitcase from the window display. A 17-second CCTV clip shows how her accomplices then formed a sort of human chain, clearing stock from the shelves and passing it out the door. Police were called, but didn’t bother to visit. So that afternoon, the gang returned and stole more gear.

A trader called Kambiz Hendessi, who owns fashion boutique Lizard Dresses, has complained about losing £500 dresses. ‘I have CCTV, I had security but, even if you employ security they are powerless, and the police in England don’t come.’ While Andy Sands, the owner of the aforementioned Chiswick Camera Centre, has dubbed the Met ‘useless’ for failing to apprehend the gang who made off with £70,000-worth of his stock.

The crooks had used a stolen van, and there was DNA evidence, Mr Sands said, but by the time there was enough to press charges the suspect had ‘fled the country’. He added: ‘I had to do most of the work tracking them down myself, the police are useless ... these thieves are just getting away with it.’

At least some of the recent rise in shoplifting can be blamed on a change in the law overseen by David Cameron, who at the behest of his Lib Dem coalition partners in 2014 redefined stealing goods worth less than £200 as a ‘summary offence’ punishable by a fine of about £70. Those who decided to plead guilty could do so by post, avoiding the embarrassment of having to appear in court.

Also to blame are the policies of major retailers who, in a bid to avoid lawsuits from injured staff, now forbid employees from intervening to prevent theft. These have been detailed in a series of viral social media films, giving thieves the impression that they can effectively operate with carte blanche.

Across the UK, shoplifting duly rose by 25 per cent last year to 365,000 cases, according to the ONS. Only 12 per cent led to court action, down from 19 per cent in 2020.

The British Retail Consortium says crime now costs its members almost £1billion pounds per year, adding: ‘Retail crime has been getting increasingly worse, with thieves becoming bolder and more aggressive.’

Many of Chiswick’s storekeepers also complain that Labour-run Hounslow council is more concerned with virtue-signalling than stopping crime.

For example, a policy of ‘dimming and trimming’ streetlights to help reduce carbon emissions mean there are more dark corners and alleyways for criminals to lurk in. Endless new bus and cycle lanes mean that it takes significantly longer for police to drive to Chiswick High Road from Acton, almost two miles away, where the nearest police station is based following Sadiq Khan’s decision to close the local station, directly opposite Riccado, before Covid.

Then there has been Hounslow’s apparent unwillingness to introduce its own version of an anti-shoplifting scheme that was recently introduced in neighbouring Hammersmith (and may have displaced gangs from there to Chiswick). It has seen 72 civil enforcement officers employed to patrol the nextdoor borough’s streets, with a particular emphasis on protecting retail areas.

There are, apparently, insufficient funds to do something similar in Chiswick, though the council did find an astonishing £50,000 last year to convert a zebra crossing on the High Road into a ‘rainbow crossing’ to celebrate gay and transgender rights.

As for the Metropolitan Police, they now finally appear to be taking the £30,000 raid on Siobhan’s store seriously. On Wednesday afternoon, three detectives showed up at Riccado. (Doubtless their sudden interest had nothing to do the Mail having submitted several questions about the affair to Scotland Yard that very morning.)

They have since issued a grovelling apology for their handling of the case, saying: ‘We are acutely aware of the distress shoplifting offences cause, and recognise that we have not provided a satisfactory initial response on this occasion.’

The problem, as Chiswick finds itself at the centre of Britain’s shoplifting epidemic, is that precious few retailers can expect a better response from the local police.","Inside shoplifting Ground Zero: Gangs ransack stores with impunity every day while woke police do nothing... even when handed damning evidence.

The photos of Harris leaving Corden's home come as the Into the Woods actor is embroiled in drama over his mistreatment of waitstaff at a popular NYC venue

Corden, who has hosted The Late Late Show since 2015, is set to end his run on the CBS show in spring, although his last day is unknown

DailyMail.com has previously reported that the talk show host is hoping to return to his native Britain in 2023

Despite Harris' objections, other sources confirmed that a real estate broker was present Thursday to talk about the Cordens moving out

Harris said in a statement to DailyMail.com that he was just visiting for 'social' reasons as his wife is good friends with Corden's wife

DailyMail.com can exclusively reveal that Million Dollar Listing LA's James Harris was recently spotted leaving The Late Late Show host's Brentwood residence

James Corden is saying goodbye to the United States, it would appear

James Cordon is planning to sell his $9.7 million LA home after he was blasted for abusing restaurant staff.

Realtor Alicia Drake was spotted at the comedian's Brentwood mansion on Thursday, along with Million Dollar Listing LA star James Harris - two days after restaurateur Keith McNally called the British performer out.

Drake later confirmed to DailyMail.com that the property is indeed up for sale.

‘It won’t be listed - it’s a private sale,' she said.

DailyMail.com’s exclusive photos show Harris, the dapper celebrity realtor, 38, leaving the $9.7m property, accompanied by Drake who wore a black minidress, and an unidentified woman.

Drake is 'one of the Westside L.A.’s top-tier brokers,' according to her bio on The Agency, which also highlights her experience handling 'unique and challenging situations, with discretion.'

'She is committed to delivering the highest level of ethics, integrity, personal service, professional representation and technical expertise, ensuring that every client is thrilled with the outcome and comfortable throughout the entire process.'

Realtor Alicia Drake, pictured, confirmed Corden's property is up for sale. She said: ‘It won’t be listed - it’s a private sale.’

Harris, 38, for his part, told DailyMail.com that he was at the home for a social visit and explained that his wife Valeria is close friends with Corden’s producer wife Julia, 46.

He also said he was not there to list or appraise the house, with a second source telling DailyMail.com: ‘There really is nothing in it. It was just a social thing.’

Friends of Corden, 44, however, have previously spoken of his wish to return to his native Britain ‘to be closer to family’ while Ben Turner, the co-founder of his production company Fulwell 73, told Variety he is ‘really excited to get James back in the UK’ in an interview in July.

Corden is due to finish filming his final series of the Late Late Show in the spring, with Turner telling the magazine: ‘[Corden] has just got so many strings to his bow, and ‘Late’ is a big commitment that’s taken up so much of his time.

‘We’re just really excited about having him back in the UK., and all the stuff that that entails, but it is a big moment for us.’

Corden purchased his $9.7m five-bedroom Brentwood home in 2017 after moving to the property from a rented mansion in Pacific Palisades.

The lavish property sprawls across 8,600sqft and comes complete with seven bathrooms, a wood-paneled library, a media room and a private gym.

The Cordens have lived in their $10 million Los Angeles home for less than five years. The family moved in December 2017 after an extensive renovation period

James Corden and wife Julia officially moved into this Brentwood home in December 2017 after purchasing the property for $9.7 million

The sprawling home has a massive backyard with its own pavilion and swimming pool

The amenities in the backyard provide plenty of shaded spots to shield the family from the hot Southern California sun

The massive kitchen included plenty of counterspace for the family to cook as well as multiple options for spaces to eat

One of the bedrooms had a massive floorplan that allowed for additional couches. The room also featured its own fireplace

A bathroom on the home's second floor led out to a balcony overlooking the beautiful backyard

The home also came with this massive space that was previously used as a recreation room

Harris, who is also British, has plenty of experience in selling high value properties. In 2019, he and David Parnes handled the sale of Petra Ecclestone’s former home - dubbed The Manor – for $120m.

The vast property, which was built by producer Aaron Spelling, became the sixth most expensive home ever sold in LA County when the deal went through.

Harris and Parnes also dealt with the sale of a huge apartment that once belonged to Cher the same year and have racked up over $3bn in property sales since 2017.

Corden’s home is relatively small by Harris and Parnes’ standards but the Brentwood property is similar to other homes sold by the British realtors.

Harris’ visit came as the comedian’s reputation took a hit, after he was dubbed ‘a tiny cretin of a man’ by Keith McNally – the British owner of upscale New York restaurant Balthazar.

In a series of scathing social media posts on Monday, McNally claimed the comedian berated servers on two separate occasions and said he planned to ‘86’ – ban – Corden from his restaurant.

The Late Late Show has found himself in a sticky situation over the past few days after the owner of New York City's Balthazar accused him of horrid behavior aimed at waitstaff

Corden, seen driving earlier this week, was reportedly one of the rudest customers Balthazar owner Keith McNally

After the news about Corden's behavior broke in the press, McNally said that the TV host called him personally to apologize for his actions

According to McNally, one of Corden’s rants came after he found a hair in his meal leading him to demand free rounds of drinks and threaten to post nasty reviews on Yelp.

On the second occasion, Corden blew up when his wife Julia, 46, was served an egg yolk omelet that also contained a trace of egg white.

Corden then phoned McNally to apologize for his behavior but reignited the row via an interview with the New York Times published Friday in which he said the drama was ‘beneath me’ and denied doing anything wrong.

He also complained about the backlash, telling the newspaper: 'I feel so Zen about the whole thing.

‘Because I think it's so silly. I just think it's beneath all of us. It's beneath you. It's certainly beneath your publication.'

Comparing the media response to his bad behavior to a school principal helping classroom bullies, he added:

'The principal makes the decision to stand up and say, 'I'd like all of those bullies to come up onto the stage and say, into the microphone, what they've just been saying in the hallway over there.’

The interview then sparked a response from McNally who demanded Corden apologize to the servers he abused.

In an Instagram post made on Friday, he said: ‘I have no wish to kick a man when he's down, but I believe the best way for James Corden to retrieve some of the vast respect the public had for him before this incident is to own up to it and apologize to the young servers he abused.'

He added: 'Whatever Corden meant, his implication was clear: he didn’t do it.'

The restauranteur concluded his outburst, by saying if Corden 'apologizes to the 2 servers he insulted, I'll let him eat free at Balthazar for the next 10 years.'",News Headlines | Today's UK World News,0

https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/nov/23/mike-pence-testify-trump-investigation-doj,0,"The US justice department has asked Mike Pence to testify in the criminal investigation into Donald Trump’s efforts to overturn the 2020 election results, according to a person familiar with the matter.

The request came before the attorney general, Merrick Garland, appointed a special counsel last week to oversee inquiries examining Trump, which are focused on two areas: potential mishandling of national security documents, and the January 6 Capitol attack.

Pence is considering testifying because unlike the congressional investigation, which he has panned, the New York Times earlier reported, the department wants him to appear before a federal grand jury, and could compel his cooperation with a subpoena.

Even if Pence is willing to testify, however, the matter could be further complicated should Trump attempt to block Pence’s testimony by asserting executive privilege – potentially prompting months of legal wrangling over what Pence is allowed to divulge.

So far, Trump’s lawyers appear to have had only limited success blocking testimony from Pence’s aides: his former chief of staff Marc Short and former legal counsel Greg Jacob appeared before a federal grand jury in Washington in July.

Moments that federal prosecutors would be likely to ask Pence about include a phone call between Trump and Pence at 11.20am ET on the morning of the Capitol attack, when Trump attempted to bully Pence into commandeering and delaying the ceremonial certification of Biden’s election win in Congress.

Trump’s words and the gist of the call were revealed when Oval Office aides described it to the House January 6 select committee. What Pence said in response remains unclear.

Both Short and Jacob, who also testified to the select committee, told investigators they did not know what Pence had said because he had walked out of the room to take the call; it was his standard practice not to brief others on his conversations with Trump.

After the call, Pence went to the Capitol and said in a statement distributed through his office that he would not carry out Trump’s wishes. He proceeded to certify Biden’s win as Trump supporters and far-right extremist groups such as the Proud Boys stormed the Capitol.

The former vice-president could also shed light on Trump’s intent and overt participation in the effort to overturn the 2020 election results, as well as whether Trump was warned those efforts were illegal, which would be critical for prosecutors as they weigh whether to issue charges.

At issue is the concept of willful blindness – and whether Trump continued to pursue strategies that he was warned could violate the law.

Emmet Flood, Pence’s lawyer, did not respond to a request for comment.

A person close to Trump suggested it was too soon to know whether Trump would assert executive privilege given Pence had not yet agreed to cooperate. Pence did say in an interview with CBS News last week that he would not cooperate in the select committee’s investigation into the Capitol attack.

“Congress has no right to my testimony on separation of powers under the constitution,” Pence said. “And I believe it will establish a terrible precedent for the Congress to summon a vice-president of the United States to speak about deliberations that took place at the White House.”

On Sunday, Pence was asked on NBC if he thought Trump had committed a crime in connection with the events of January 6, when some Trump supporters who attacked the Capitol chanted “hang Mike Pence”, to which he replied: “I don’t know if it is criminal to listen to bad advice from lawyers.”

Pence is eyeing a presidential run for which he appears to be pursuing a balancing act, seeking to distance himself from Trump while appealing to Republican voters.

His new memoir, So Help Me God, which deals in detail with his version of events during his time at Trump’s side, includes an extensive account of Pence’s role in, and views of, Trump’s attempts to stay in office.

Trump, he writes, said he was “too honest” to take part in a plot based on claims of widespread electoral fraud. He also says Republicans were right to lodge objections to results in key states, as it “meant we would have a substantive debate”.

But the former vice-president also made clear that he views Trump as responsible for the Capitol attack. In a recent interview with ABC News concerning January 6, he said Trump’s words and actions “angered me”.



“But I turned to my daughter who was standing nearby. And I said, ‘It doesn’t take courage to break the law. It takes courage to uphold the law.’ The president’s words were reckless. It’s clear he decided to be part of the problem,” Pence said.",Justice department asks Pence to testify in Trump investigation,0

https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-10525411/Kevin-McCarthy-officially-endorses-Liz-Cheneys-RIVAL-midterm-reelection.html,0,"Kevin McCarthy endorsed on Thursday Representative Liz Cheney's primary rival Harriet Hageman (pictured)

Kevin McCarthy on Thursday endorsed Harriet Hageman in her bid to unseat Republican traitor Liz Cheney in her at-large Wyoming district, the minority leader's campaign confirmed to DailyMail.com.

'The most successful Representatives in Congress focus on the needs of their constituents, and throughout her career, Harriet has championed America's natural resources and helped the people of Wyoming reject burdensome and onerous government overreach,' McCarthy said in a statement on the endorsement .

'I look forward to welcoming Harriet to a Republican majority next Congress, where together, we will hold the Biden Administration accountable and deliver much-needed solutions for the American people,' he added.

A spokesperson for Cheney said McCarthy's endorsement proves that Hagemen is 'desperate'.

'Wow, she must be really desperate.' Jeremy Adler told DailyMail.com

Hageman grew up on her family's ranch outside of Fort Laramie, Wyoming. She ran for governor of the state in 2018 but lost the Republican primary.

Her campaign website goes on the offensive, reading: 'Liz Cheney cast her lot with the Washington, D.C. elites and those who use their power to further their own agenda at our expense. She doesn't represent Wyoming and she doesn't represent conservatives.'

'We deserve better. We demand better,' Hagemen added. 'I am running to represent Wyomingites and take our state back from big government.'

Cheney is one of the two Republicans on the House select committee investigating the January 6, 2021 Capitol attack.

Her position on the panel has raised calls for her to be booted from the Republican Party – especially from those in her deeply red state who agree with Donald Trump's claims the election was riddled with fraud and foul play.

There are at least five Republicans going for Cheney's seat in the primary race, but Hageman just got the backing of the most powerful Republican in the House, which will surely slingshot her to the nomination.

'I look forward to welcoming Harriet to a Republican majority next Congress, where together, we will hold the Biden Administration accountable and deliver much-needed solutions for the American people,' the House Minority leader wrote in a statement

In the 2016 election, Wyoming went 68.2 percent for Trump and voted to reelect him in 2020 with 69.9 percent – a 1.7 percent increase in support for the former president.

On the other hand, Cheney, the daughter of former Vice President Dick Cheney, was also widely popular in her previous elections.

In 2020 she won her primary with 68.6 percent of the vote and her primary that same year with 73.5 percent of support from GOP voters.

The party since then has turned against her now that she has spoken out against Trump following the 2020 elections.

Cheney was censured by the Wyoming Republican Party for her participation in the select committee's investigation as well as her comments critical of the former president.

Earlier this month she and fellow panel GOP member Representative Adam Kinzinger from Illinois, who is not running for reelection, were censured by the Republican National Committee in a vote at its winter meeting in Salt Lake City, Utah.",Kevin McCarthy officially endorses Liz Cheney's RIVAL for her midterm reelection,0

But things got off to a precarious start on Sunday as the hosts lost their opening match, thousands of seats remained empty and rows continued over various issues which emerged ahead of the start of the 'most controversial' tournament ever.

Even the big World Cup kick-off was somewhat fluffed, as the referee decided he did not want to wait for the crowd to complete their countdown to zero and blew the whistle two seconds early.

Disgraced actor Morgan Freeman performed in the ceremony in front of thousands of empty seats, which was not shown in the UK as the BBC chose to show a report about the country's human rights record instead, raising accusations of hypocrisy.

The World Cup, which has been plagued with controversy over the Middle Eastern country's treatment of foreign workers, LGBT+ rights and social restrictions, has been seen by Qataris as a way of varnishing its image on the world stage.

The nation has denied accusations of abuse of workers and discrimination, but that did not stop the BBC's coverage, fronted by Gary Lineker, including a pre-packaged report on Qatar's questionable human rights record and the controversy surrounding the tournament, instead of showing the opening ceremony.

It follows accusations over fake 'fans' being hired by the Qatari regime in order to hype up crowds by supporting various nations, which the country strongly denies.

In an embarrassing moment for FIFA organisers they were forced to allow a ban on alcohol sales at games after the Qatari royal family put pressure on the body due to the country's strict ban on drinking in public. FIFA had previously charged Budweiser a reported £63 million for a sponsorship deal giving them a beer monopoly on the tournament - but much of this could now go to waste due to the last-minute rule change.

It came just 48 hours before the start of the tournament and left fans livid, accusing the host nation of 'ruining' the world cup before it had even begun. Fans can now only purchase alcohol in select hotels and bars of the FIFA fan zone, but here can only purchase four pints for a costly £12.50 each.

On Saturday the shaky start to the tournament was precluded by FIFA boss Gianni Infantino giving a rambling and bizarre press conference in which he condemned critics of the host nation.

He claimed that he felt like a 'woman', a 'migrant worker', 'gay', a 'Qatari', an 'Asian' and various other identities, which sparked furious reaction online given the focus on the rights of women and minority groups in the country.

Meanwhile tonight's ceremony saw fierce backlash due to the involvement of Freeman, who eight separate actors and eight witnesses have accused of sexual harassment and inappropriate behaviour on set.

Qatari YouTuber Ghanim Al Muftah stars in World Cup opening ceremony World Cup Ambassador Ghanim grew up playing football with gloves or shoes on his hands By James Reynolds For MailOnline Qatari YouTuber Ghanim Al Muftah, 20, starred alongside Morgan Freeman in the World Cup opening ceremony. Al Muftah is known for his motivational speeches and social media presence, featuring on TEDxQatarUniversity in 2018, aged 16, to talk about his condition, caudal regression syndrome. Caudal regression syndrome (CRS) affects the development of the lower half of the body, which can include the spine, limbs, bladder, bowels and gut. The bones in the lower spine can be abnormal or missing, with spinal abnormalities often also affecting the chest, which makes breathing difficult. Qatar-born Mr Al Muftah was chosen as one of the official FIFA World Cup Ambassadors this year. In a statement, the Loughborough University politics student said: 'Within my capacities as a [Fifa World Cup] ambassador, I want to send a message of hope, inclusivity, peace, and unity for humanity.' Mr Al Muftah is known for his philanthropy, having set up the Association of Ghanim with help from his family. The association donates wheelchairs to the people in need. Advertisement

Italy's Daniele Orsato, the match referee, blew his whistle two seconds early to start the tournament.

The stadium announcer had urged the 60,000 crowd to join in a countdown with the help of the giant electronic boards in the stadium.

Mr Orsato was not hanging around and showed who was in charge as he ordered play to begin without waiting any longer for the crowd.

Empty seats were clearly visible in the background of the ceremony, and while these appeared to have filled with fans by the time of kick-off at 7pm local time, they emptied again before the final whistle.

Qatar was soundly beaten by a comfortable Ecuador in the opening match of the tournament, which the hosts demanded take place today after it had been previously scheduled to take place on Monday.

Losing 2-0, organisers were left red-faced as thousands of spectators departed while the game was still taking place in full view of the cameras. In a historic match, it is the first time the host nation has lost its opening game in any World Cup to date.

It was against the backdrop of strict rules for fans to follow throughout the tournament, including not showing public signs of affection, drinking and women having to wear modest clothing.

In the stands VIPs including former England star David Beckham, FIFA president Gianni Infantino and world leaders such as Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdogan cosied up to each other and members of the Qatari royal family.

Anger wasn't just directed towards the hosts - the BBC also came under fire in a tense opening day after Gary Lineker and fellow pundits Alex Scott and Alan Shearer chose to address the human rights abuses at the top of their programme.

Lineker said: 'It's the most controversial World Cup in recent history and a ball hasn't even been kicked.

'Ever since FIFA chose Qatar back in 2010, the smallest nation to host football's greatest competition has faced some big questions.

'From accusations of corruption in the bidding process to the treatment of migrant workers who've built the stadiums where many lost their lives. Homosexuality is illegal here and women's rights are also in the spotlight. Also the decision to switch the tournament from summer to winter.

'Against that back drop, there is a tournament to be played here that will be watched and enjoyed around the world. Stick to football say FIFA, well we will for a couple of minutes at least.'

Morgan Freeman kicked off the World Cup opening ceremony in Qatar today in front of the country's royals and rows of empty seats following weeks of criticism over the country's human rights record.

The actor, 85, who four years ago apologised following accusations of sexual harassment and inappropriate behavior, today narrated the event's opening segment titled 'The Calling', telling viewers 'We all gather here in one big tribe' as fans descended on Doha city centre for the imminent kick off of the world's greatest football festival.

Freeman spoke with 20-year-old Qatari entrepreneur and influencer Ghanim al Muftah - a FIFA World Cup Ambassador who was born with Caudal Regression Syndrome, a rare disorder which impairs the development of the lower spine - who said to the actor: 'Come on over.'

When Freeman replied 'I'm not sure, Am I welcome?', al Muftah said: 'We sent out the call because everyone is welcome. This is an invitation to the whole world.'

Freeman replied: 'I remember, even after hearing the call, instead of seeing another way, we dismissed it and demanded our own way. And now the world feels even more distant and divided. How can so many countries, languages and cultures come together, if only one way is accepted?'

His appearance comes four years after he was accused of sexual misconduct by eight women and issued an apology to 'anyone who felt uncomfortable or disrespected' by his behaviour, saying it was 'never my intent'.

Sixteen people - eight witnesses and eight who claimed to be victims - had come forward to allege the actor engaged in 'inappropriate behaviour' and 'harassment' as they worked alongside him.

Football fans have reacted with fury on social media at the actor's appearance in the ceremony, with one calling it 'disappointing' and another saying: 'When you have to act out a scene with Morgan Freeman ''welcoming the entire world'' to your country for a soccer tournament, maybe you shouldn't host the World Cup.'

The opening ceremony featured scenes titled 'Leta'Arafo (To Know One Another)', followed by 'Chants of Nations', a World Cup Medley, a showcase of the official mascots and Jung Kook of South Korean boy band BTS.

Qatar's Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani arrived at the stadium flanked by FIFA president Gianni Infantino, to a roaring crowd, and took their seats alongside other Arab leaders.

A show then unfolded on the pitch, featuring three camels, American actor Morgan Freeman and a performance of a new tournament song called Dreamers featuring singer Jungkook of K-pop boy band BTS, alongside Qatari singer Fahad Al-Kubaisi.

Saudi Arabia's crown prince and the presidents of Egypt, Turkey and Algeria, as well as the United Nations Secretary-General, are among leaders at the in a tent-shaped stadium ahead of the first match between the hosts and Ecuador.

Qatar, which has denied accusations of abuse of workers and discrimination, and FIFA hope the spotlight will now turn to action on the pitch. Organisers have also denied allegations of bribery for hosting rights.

Inside Al Bayt Stadium many seats were still vacant with gridlock on the expressway leading to the arena, where cheers went up as Qatar's team appeared for their opening match.

The soccer tournament, the first held in the Middle East and the most expensive in its history, is a culmination of Qatar's soft power push, after a 3-1/2 year boycott by Saudi Arabia, Egypt, the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain which ended in 2021.

The UAE, whose rapprochement with Doha has been slower than that of Riyadh and Cairo, sent its vice president who is also ruler of Dubai, where many World Cup fans have opted to stay.

For the first time, a direct commercial flight from Tel Aviv to Doha landed in Qatar on Sunday despite the absence of formal bilateral ties, in a deal brokered by FIFA to carry both Palestinians and Israelis to the tournament.

The Gulf state's Deputy Prime Minister Khalid Al-Attiyah, in remarks on state media, said Qatar was reaping benefits of years of 'hard work and sound planning'.

On Saturday, FIFA's Infantino rounded on European critics of Qatar, saying engagement was the only way to improve rights, while Doha has also pointed to labour reforms.

Denmark's and Germany's team captains will wear One Love armbands as they prepare to compete in a conservative Muslim state where same-sex relations are illegal. Organisers say all are welcome while warning against public affection.

Supporters today arrived at the Al Bayt stadium for this afternoon's opening match under a glaring sun in temperatures in excess of 30 degrees celsius.

The vice president of the United Arab Emirates, Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al-Maktoum, who is also Dubai's ruler, arrived in Qatar for the World Cup opening on Sunday, Qatar's news agency said.

And Saudi Arabia's powerful crown prince and a delegation of ministers arrived in the neighbouring country this morning to attend the opening ceremony, Saudi state media reported.

Mohammed bin Salman was accompanied by the kingdom's energy, interior, foreign, commerce and investment ministers as well as senior officials including his national security adviser and head of the National Guard, the official Saudi Press Agency said.

Qatari fans in crisp white thobes and women in black shayla headdresses and abayhas were seen filing into the stadium, which has been designed to look like the tents used by nomads.

They were accompanied by Ecuador fans, many of whom donned extravagant headdresses, balaclavas and masks and carried their national flags.

The atmosphere appeared friendly, with both sets of fans stopping to snap photos together outside the stadium's entry gates.

Many of the labourers who toiled to build the eight stadiums will have watched from the sidelines, unable to afford the highest ticket prices ever for a World Cup despite working tirelessly to fulfil a brutal schedule which saw many of their colleagues perish.

But a lucky few were said to be sprinkled among the well-heeled audience having been gifted tickets by the England football team.

The controversy that has long surrounded the decision to award the tiny Gulf state the World Cup has built to a crescendo ahead of the tournament, with unrelenting scrutiny of its treatment of migrant workers and the LGBT+ community.

'We are ready,' Qatar supporter Hakeem Ahmad told Reuters as he entered the stadium with his wife and two children.

'Whatever happens on the pitch, the world should look kindly on us today.

'We have organised this party for you. If Qatar can perform well, that would be a bonus for us.

'We hope that after today people will see Qatar in a different light, for who we really are. It is time to talk positively about Qatar.'

Cathal Kelly, columnist for Canada's national newspaper the Globe and Mail, summed up the distractions.

'Once the first ball is kicked, no one cares if they're holding this thing on a ceremonial burial ground or powering it with coal,' he wrote.

That will certainly be the hope of football's governing body FIFA and Qatari organisers who have pleaded for critics to focus on the football and not let the sport be dragged into ideological or political battles.

'This is the first time I've come to a World Cup,' Wilmer Saltos, 35, a farmer, who has travelled from Guayaquil on the coast of Ecuador with his brother and sister told Reuters while waiting in the heat to enter the stadium.

'When we saw that Ecuador was opening the tournament, we thought we just had to be here. There are obviously big cultural differences, you can't deny it.

'But for us, today is about the football, we just want to focus on the game.'

While Qatar is hosting one of sport's biggest parties it will be a mostly alcohol free after officials decided to turn off the beer taps inside stadiums, drawing even more criticism.

Qatar is a typically teetotal nation where tourists can only buy or consume alcohol inside licensed hotels or restaurants.

Exemptions for the World Cup previously meant meant fans were able to buy beers in special 'fan zones' or on stadium concourses.

But Qatar reneged on part of that deal, meaning beer can now only be sold only inside the 'fan zones' and will not be available in the stadiums.

Pints will cost £12, only be available at certain times, and each person will be limited to a maximum of four to stop them getting drunk.

Beer or no beer, Qataris and thousands of visiting fans have arrived ready to party with throngs packing the FIFA Fan Festival zones in central Doha along the city's famed Corniche.",Qatar World Cup: Rows of empty seats as 'fans' leave early and Morgan Freeman hosts opening ceremony,0

The brand new 8849 TANK 3 Pro from Unihertz is decidedly less tanken than the JCBs I chucked around earlier, but the still not-insubstantial 6.79-inches comes powered by an octa-core Dimensity 8200 processor with a hard focus on power efficiency and thermal management, but more on that in a moment, so its certainly no slouch. Also blessed with 512GB of ROM that can be expanded all the way up to a whopping 2TB and RAM that can be ramped up from an initial choice of 16- or 18GB right up to 36GB. So, plenty of powerful and cavernous capacity.

Now, this could be for images snapped with the considerable 50MP front camera or the ridiculously overblown 200MP rear camera. It could be for that and very probably, in part, is. But it’s very likely to have more to do with the TANK 3 Pro’s built-in 100-lumen 120Hz DLP projector, isn’t it? Yep, your eyes do not deceive you and, equally, I have not lost the plot, this tough-phone tough act to follow can indeed project images and movies with a 1.2:1 throw ratio, at screens sizes from 40 inches to 80 inches to 100 inches at 1m, 2m and 4m respective distances, with automatic correction and adjustable focus, with cooling fans to ensure you can enjoy your visual entertainment wherever the merry hell you are uninterrupted by anything other than, if camping, the horrors of nature at night.

Rated IP68 and with a screen covered in protective glass, even if you fumble the TANK 3 Pro onto some inconveniently placed rocks during set-up of outdoor cinema night, you can just dust it down and… wait, did you hear that? There’s something moving, over there, near that clump of shrubs. There! Heard it again. Hang on, pass me down the TANK 3 Pro. Why? Because it has all of the amazing stuff above, plus a 64MP Night Vision camera too.

To conclude, with an impressive battery life of up to 56 hours to boot, the 8849 TANK 3 Pro possesses all the bells and whistles. And at a score under a monkey, as stated earlier, the Tank 3 Pro is a tough-phone tough act to follow, so we’re not even going to try.

https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8023149/Two-passengers-die-coronavirus-doomed-cruise-ship-Diamond-Princess.html,0,"Two passengers from the coronavirus-hit Diamond Princess cruise ship have died, it has emerged today – with fears now mounting for the hundreds of tourists left aboard and those who have already disembarked the vessel.

The elderly Japanese victims, an 87-year-old man and an 84-year-old woman, had underlying conditions and were taken off the ship on February 11 and 12 before being treated in hospital.

Both tested positive for the SARS-CoV-2 virus although the woman's cause of death was listed as pneumonia – a known complication of the never-before-seen virus, the Japanese health ministry said.

At least 634 passengers have been infected on the gigantic vessel, which has been quarantined off the coast of Yokohama since February 3 with 3,700 people on board.

Leading experts have slammed the quarantine as a 'major failure' and 'completely inadequate', claiming the ship had become a 'source of infection' rather than a safe haven.

It comes as the Foreign Office has finally confirmed Britons stuck on the Diamond Princess will be airlifted home tomorrow evening, days after other countries including the US began to rescue their passengers.

More than 450 passengers have already disembarked after they tested negative for the virus and did not show any symptoms – such as a cough, fever or shortness of breath. Hundreds more will leave today.

In other developments to the coronavirus crisis today:

More than 75,000 people worldwide have now caught the virus, with almost 99 per cent of cases in China. The global death toll now stands at almost 2,130

Japanese Professor Kentaro Iwata, who helped tackle Ebola in Africa and the 2003 SARS crisis in China, said conditions on the ship were 'completely chaotic' and violated quarantine rules

China's efforts to control the deadly outbreak of 'are working', Beijing's top diplomat said, attributing an easing in new cases to his country's 'forceful action' against the illness

British couple David and Sally Abel, who tested positive for the virus and were taken to a hospital after begging to be rescued, have posted pictures from their hospital beds

David Abel, one of the Brits on board the Diamond Princess who begged the Government to rescue them, posted a picture of himself in a Japanese hostel today while getting treated by medics on Facebook today. He posted a picture of his wife, Sally, also getting treated. Mrs Abel was also taken off the cruise after she tested positive

In another post, Mr Abel said: 'We arrived in lovely hospital a couple of hours ago. Taken by ambulance blues & twos the entire journey... Last communication so please don't worry about not hearing from us: See you all before you know it'

No details about the former passengers who died after getting off the Diamond Princess have been given by health officials in Japan, other than their ages.

The pair are the first fatal cases among the more than 600 cases diagnosed on the cruise ship, which has had more infected passengers than all of the countries in the world combined – excluding China.

Japanese Health Minister Katsunobu Kato offered partial confirmation of the deaths but said he had to wait until families had been informed before making it official.

'I pray for their souls and offer condolences to their bereaved families,' he told MPs. 'The two were sent to medical facilities when they showed symptoms. I believe that they received the best possible treatment.'

Yesterday, 443 passengers disembarked after testing negative for the virus and not showing symptoms during a 14-day quarantine period. The rest of the passengers will be allowed to leave in waves over the next two days.

Hundreds more passengers are expected to leave the ship today, with some already pictured getting into yellow buses and leaving for stations and airports for home. The Japanese Health Ministry, which is running operations on the ship, could not confirm how many people remained on board.

Those who have shared a room with people testing positive were required to remain in quarantine, as were crew.

But questions are increasingly being asked as to why former Diamond Princess passengers are able to roam freely around Japan's famously crowded cities, even if they have tested negative.

'Is it really safe to get off?' screamed a headline in the Nikkan Sports tabloid. The paper quoted a passenger who said he was tested on February 15 and left four days later. 'I thought I could be infected during the four days. I thought ""Is it really OK""?'

It comes as more than 150 Australian passengers arrived home after a pre-dawn departure from Tokyo's Haneda airport. They face another 14-day quarantine.

Buses escorted by police cars transported the Australian passengers from Yokohama to Tokyo's Haneda Airport late Wednesday.

The buses drove the Australians straight to the tarmac, where they boarded the government-chartered plane.

Some Hong Kong passengers also went home, while Canadians were due to leave on a charter flight in the early hours of Friday, Tokyo time, a Canadian government spokeswoman said.

An evacuation flight was also being arranged for British nationals to leave Tokyo on Friday. MailOnline understands it will take off in the evening local time. Tokyo is nine hours ahead of GMT, meaning if a flight was to leave the Japanese city at 7pm local time, it would be 10am in London.

Earlier in the week, the US evacuated more than 340 nationals on two chartered flights, with two planes picking them up from nearby Tokyo over the weekend.

They will spend two weeks in quarantine on military bases in California and Texas after 14 people were diagnosed with the coronavirus during the bus ride to the airport.

BRITISH COUPLE WHO CAUGHT THE VIRUS SAY THEY ARE IN THE 'BEST PLACE' AFTER BEING TAKEN TO HOSPITAL IN JAPAN A British couple diagnosed with coronavirus in Japan have said they are 'in the best place' as they posted pictures from their hospital beds. David and Sally Abel, from Northamptonshire, have been transferred for hospital treatment from the Diamond Princess cruise ship. Around 70 other Britons from the ship are due to fly back to the UK from Tokyo on Friday on a repatriation flight organised by the Foreign Office. In a Facebook post, Mr Abel said: 'We arrived in lovely hospital a couple of hours ago. Taken by ambulance blues & twos the entire journey. Outside the hospital I came over a bit weird and nearly passed out. Every pore on my body opened and i was wheelchaired to our room. 'Full health inspection and now we know what's going on. We both contracted a cold (unaware of) and it has not yet turned into pneumonia. (we do have coronavirus). 'Tomorrow the big tests commence. chest x-rays, ECG, chest scan, urine + more. We are both in the best place! They do know what they are doing and our two nurses are gorgeous. Sally likes the Dr too.' Mr Abel said that following treatment, the couple will need three rounds of all-clears on coronavirus tests. He added: 'Wi-fi will not work for me, so this will be the final communication for some time. See you all before you know it.' In further posts, Mr Abel said his wife Sally had a bed in the same room as him and that they were 'thinking of all the Brits flying to UK tomorrow.' He also said it was 'impossible to send or receive emails' and he was unable to contact the British Embassy or his family. Advertisement

A US State Department official said there were still about 45 US citizens on board the cruise ship as of Thursday.

Americans flown back will have to complete another 14 days quarantine, as will returning Hong Kong residents.

Disembarked Japanese passengers, however, face no such restrictions, a decision that has sparked concern.

Japan's chief cabinet secretary, Yoshihide Suga, when asked yesterday why Japanese leaving the ship did not have to spend another two weeks in quarantine, referred to the advice of Japan's National Institute of Infectious Diseases (NIID).

The NIID said there should be no problem if people had shown no symptoms for 14 days and had tested negative for the virus during the period their health was under surveillance.

Besides those on the cruise liner and returnees brought home from Wuhan, China, about 70 cases of domestic infections have been confirmed in Japan, including 25 in Tokyo, public broadcaster NHK reported.

The spread of the virus has raised concerns about planning for the Tokyo Summer Olympics as well as the impact on Japan's economy.

Health Minister Katsunobu Kato today defended Japan's response in parliament, telling lawmakers that officials have taken expert advice and responded to issues on a daily basis.

In a move to reassure the public, the health ministry also issued a statement in both English and Japanese that said all passengers had been required to stay in their cabins since February 5 to contain the virus.

It comes as a British couple diagnosed with coronavirus in Japan have said they are 'in the best place' as they posted pictures from their hospital beds.

David and Sally Abel, from Northamptonshire, have been transferred for hospital treatment from the Diamond Princess cruise ship, which has been quarantined near Yokohama, Japan. They had previously begged the Government to help rescue them, and even asked billionaire Sir Richard Branson to step in.

Around 70 other Britons from the ship are due to fly back to the UK from Tokyo on Friday on a repatriation flight organised by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office.

In a Facebook post, Mr Abel said: 'We arrived in lovely hospital a couple of hours ago.

He also said it was 'impossible to send or receive emails' and he was unable to contact the British Embassy or his family.

Another British national on the ship who has recovered from the virus posted on Facebook on Wednesday to say he is heading home.

Alan Steele said: 'Informed we will have to do another 2weeks quarentine (sic) back in blighty although japan has set me free as all ok.'

Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab confirmed the evacuation flight for British nationals on board the Diamond Princess cruise ship will leave from Tokyo.

He said: 'Details have been sent to those who have registered for the flight. We urge other British nationals still seeking to leave to contact us.

'We will continue to support British nationals who wish to stay in Japan.'

Meanwhile, a Department of Health and Social Care spokesman said on Wednesday that those Britons repatriated from the Diamond Princess will be quarantined for 14 days at Arrowe Park Hospital on the Wirral on their return.

There were 78 British passengers on the cruise liner when cases of the coronavirus strain known as Covid-19 started to emerge.

Four British cases have since been confirmed by the Foreign Office. The Foreign Office has said Britons diagnosed with coronavirus will continue to be supported while they undergo treatment in Japan.

Meanwhile, the European Commission has announced the EU will be financing the repatriation of citizens from any of the EU27 still stuck on the Diamond Princess.

As of 2pm on Wednesday, a total of 5,216 people in the UK have been tested for coronavirus, of whom nine have tested positive.

New cases have fallen to less than 2,000 per day for the past two days but officials and analysts have warned that the threat of a more serious outbreak remains as people gradually return to work following a prolonged Lunar New Year holiday.

While the overall spread of the virus appears to have been slowing, the situation remains severe in Hubei province where the virus is thought to have originated.

China's efforts to control the deadly outbreak of a new coronavirus 'are working', Beijing's top diplomat said Thursday, attributing an easing in new cases to his country's 'forceful action' against the illness.

WHAT ARE OTHER COUNTRIES DOING TO EVACUATE CITIZENS WHO ARE STUCK ON THE DIAMOND PRINCESS? UK: The UK government is in the process of planning an evacuation flight for around 70 citizens on board. The flight is expected to take off on the evening of February 21 from Tokyo US: The US government, on February 16 and 17, flew 340 of its citizens back to the States after evacuating them from the stranded cruise ship. They were put on board two cargo planes, which had separate isolation facilities for 14 passengers who were diagnosed with coronavirus on the way to the airport. All were taken to military bases in California and Texas to serve a further two weeks of quarantine to make sure they are not contagious. South Korea: South Korea sent one of its president's jets to Tokyo on Tuesday, February 18, to evacuate its citizens from the ship. Just five people were on board. Australia: Australia evacuated 180 residents from the cruise ship on February 20. The passengers were taken to a former workers' site 18.6miles (30km) south east of Darwin to be quarantined for two weeks, alongside at least 250 Australians airlifted out of Wuhan. Canada: Canada will charter a flight on the same day, February 18, to take its citizens home from Tokyo if they are believed to be free of the virus. Hong Kong: Hong Kong will charter a plane to retrieve citizens on board the Diamond Princess. A person who got off the ship in Hong Kong was the first passenger to be diagnosed with coronavirus and triggered the lockdown. Italy: Italy will send a plane this week to retrieve 35 of its citizens who are on the Diamond Princess – one of whom is the captain of the ship. 25 of the Italians are crew members. No date for the evacuation has been announced yet. Israel: Israel's health ministry announced on February 17 it was speaking to insurance firms of the dozen nationals on the Diamond Princess to organise flying them home. Advertisement

Speaking in Laos after talks with peers from the 10 Southeast Asian (ASEAN) countries, Wangi Yi said the outbreak was 'controllable and curable' despite the global panic it has seeded.

'China is not only protecting its own people but also the rest of the world,' he told the summit in Vientiane, referencing a recent sharp drop in new cases of the virus inside China, where it has killed more than 2,100 people.

The hastily-convened summit with ASEAN neighbours comes as a region dependent on the flow of Chinese goods and tourists faces a steep bill following restrictions on movement from China.

A similar meeting was held in 2003 following the outbreak of SARS.

Originating in the central Chinese city of Wuhan, the new coronavirus - known as COVID-19 - has infected more than 74,000 people inside China.

The government has locked down tens of millions of people in several virus-hit cities, extended Lunar New Year holidays and pulled flights in a scramble to contain the virus.

Still the health scare has cascaded across Southeast Asia, with cases recorded in the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam.

The Philippines, Singapore and Vietnam have restricted flights from mainland China and suspended visa-free arrivals as health screening ramps up at entry points.

Thailand, which has imposed no such restrictions, reported a 90 percent slump in arrivals from the mainland this month, a gut punch to an already beleaguered tourist sector which makes up nearly a fifth of the economy.

Thailand anticipates a loss of more than $8 billion by year's end from the tourist tail-off.

In Laos, Beijing will be eager to 'project regional solidarity with its anti-pandemic efforts' a Southeast Asian diplomat told AFP, declining to be named.

China sees ASEAN as its backyard and has ramped up economic, diplomatic and cultural influence over recent years with billions of dollars of investment, tourist outflows and a bigger presence at regional summits.

There are fears prolonged disruption by the virus could slow work on the massive China-backed 'Belt and Road' infrastructure schemes which criss-cross ASEAN.

Philippine Foreign Minister Teodoro Locsin Jr thanked China for its 'unprecedented domestic measures and quick action' - apparently referring to the lockdowns of several large cities as the virus billowed out.

But he recognised the 'massively detrimental' economic impact of the disease, which has constricted global trade and tourism vital to many Southeast Asian economies.",Two passengers die from coronavirus on doomed cruise ship Diamond Princess,0

One later found injured at nearby home

Bystanders have pulled two men and a boy out of an allegedly stolen car that burst into flames after smashing into a tree in western Sydney, before the two men fled the scene, leaving the young boy behind, as one of the occupants remains on the run.

Police were called to an intersection in Cranebrook on Thursday night after a stolen car had crashed and exploded into flames.

Before police arrived, heroic bystanders pulled two men and a 12-year-old boy from the burning wreckage.

One of the men who had been in the car allegedly fled the scene on foot.

Then, two others arrived, and placed the second occupant of the crash in a shopping trolley, before making their own hasty exit from the scene of the crash.

The 12-year-old boy was left behind at the scene as his mate allegedly fled in the shopping trolley, where he was taken to Nepean Hospital suffering a broken leg and hip injuries.

Shortly after the crash, paramedics were called to a nearby home in Rosannah Way, Cranebrook where a man was heard yelling in distress inside.

When they arrived, they were refused entry to the home and had to request assistance from the police.

Inside the residence, two men, aged 40 and 55, allegedly obstructed the police, prompting the use of capsicum spray. Additionally, a Taser was employed to control an aggressive dog.

One of men involved in the earlier car accident was found inside the house, suffering from a broken leg and head lacerations.

He was then transported to Westmead Hospital, where mandatory testing was conducted.

A NSW Police spokeswoman told Daily Mail Australia a manhunt continues for the first occupant of the vehicle who fled the scene on foot.

Two men (one pictured) were later arrested at a nearby home where an injured occupants was found inside

The car fire was later extinguished by firefighters

The 40-year-old and 55-year-old were charged with hindering police.

They were bailed to appear in Penrith Local Court in September.

Investigations into the identity of the driver who crashed the vehicle continue.

Police are due to provide an update on the incident later on Friday morning.

Police allege the vehicle was stolen from a Cranebrook home during a break and enter in the early hours of August 30.

The residents were asleep inside the home at the time and not disturbed.

Anyone with information about the crash – or has any dashcam or mobile phone footage is urged to call Crime Stoppers.

The duo had gone so far as to record a video showing them brandishing their weapons in front of an ISIS flag while explaining their intended actions.

The family members were named as Canadian citizens Ahmed Fouad Mostafa Eldidi, 62, Mostafa Eldidi, 26, were allegedly armed with an axe and a machete in the video. They were arrested on July 25.

Police say that their target was an unspecified location in Toronto. The hotel where they were taken into custody is located just 30 minutes drive from the downtown area.

They are each facing six ISIS-related terrorism offenses, including possessing weapons for the benefit of the Sunni-terror organization.

This screenshot from a surveillance camera shows heavily armed Canadian police raiding the home that the two suspects shared in a quiet Toronto suburb

Neighbors were shocked to learn of the pair's involvement with terrorism and were awoken to the sound of flash grenades going off in the early hours of Sunday

Just this week, Canadian citizen Khalid Hussein, 29, was found guilty in England of being a member of Al-Muhajiroun, a terrorist group, and sentenced to five years in prison. He stood trial alongside hate preacher Anjem Choudary, who was sentenced to 29 years in prison.

Ahmed is also charged with aggravated assault that resulted from an ISIS video he is accused of appearing in that was shot in a different country in 2015, reports Global News.

The network reports that the video from a decade ago shows Ahmed, clad in a black robe with his face visible, hacking at an ISIS prisoner in an orange jumpsuit with a sword as the victim was suspended on a pole.

The video was shot in a desert and distributed by one of the ISIS media arms, Al-Raud Media.

The connection between Ahmed and that video was made through the Royal Canadian Mounted Police's Integrated National Security Enforcement Team.

Meanwhile officials in Canada have said that there is no outstanding threat as a result of Ahmed and Mostafa's intended actions, indicating investigators do not believe that they were part of a larger cell.

Officials did not say if the duo were working with other ISIS operatives in different countries.

Despite decimated in their former strongholds in Iraq and Syria, officials have long maintained that ISIS activists are still active worldwide

Just this week, Canadian citizen Khaled Hussein was sentenced to five years in prison in the UK for his membership of Al-Muhajiroun, a terrorist group

'As you know, they were charged with having particular weapons. In other words, we're pretty confident how close they were to moving from simply having those tools and then moving on to actioning that threat,' RCMP Supt. James Parr said.

The father and son lived together in the eastern Toronto suburb of Scarborough.

The home was also raided on Sunday night, reports The Toronto Star. Neighbors told the newspaper that they were awoken to a sound akin to a 'car crash' which is thought to have been a stun grenade.

Surveillance video from the area showed officers with assault rifles raiding the home. Later, an ambulance arrived to take a woman from the home.

'I don't feel safe at all to know that somebody in my backyard was (arrested for terrorism),' a neighbor told The Star while adding that they hadn't seen the family that much this year.

Another neighbor echoed that sentiment.

'I feel uneasy, I feel very disappointed that this happened... This street is very quiet, it's very secluded. Any strange car comes here, and we know,' Hema Ramperasad said.

The neighbors said that they had previously complained to the family about the amount of cameras set up in their backyard that appeared to be focused on the surrounding homes.

The suspects were unknown to police prior to this incident. Officials have not said what prompted an investigation into the pair.

Nearly 40 members of ISIS have been charged with various crimes in Canada since the group was established in the borderlands between Syria and Iraq in 2014. Around 20 of those have been convicted, another 14 are awaiting trial.

Ahmed and Mostafa will make their first court appearance on Thursday.

A decade after the Islamic State militant group declared its caliphate in large parts of Iraq and Syria, the extremists no longer control any land, have lost many prominent leaders and are mostly out of the world news headlines.

Still, the group continues to recruit members and claim responsibility for deadly attacks around the world, including lethal operations in Iran and Russia earlier this year that left scores dead.

Its sleeper cells in Syria and Iraq still carry out attacks against government forces in both countries as well as U.S.-backed Syrian fighters, at a time when Iraq's government is negotiating with Washington over a possible withdrawal of U.S. troops.

The group that once attracted tens of thousands of fighters and supporters from around the world to come to Syria and Iraq, and at its peak ruled an area half the size of the United Kingdom was notorious for its brutality.

It beheaded civilians, slaughtered 1,700 captured Iraqi soldiers in a short period, and enslaved and raped thousands of women from the Yazidi community, one of Iraq's oldest religious minorities.

'Daesh remains a threat to international security,' U.S. Army Maj. Gen. J.B. Vowell, the commanding general of Combined Joint Task Force — Operation Inherent Resolve, said earlier this month.

Charles Bronson has been incarcerated for much of the last five decades after being jailed for armed robbery in 1974 and will face a public parole hearing next year, after becoming the first prisoner in the UK to formally request one.

The 69-year-old, who is locked up at high-security HMP Woodhill in Milton Keynes, had hoped it would take place over the summer months, but the parole hearing will instead take place in 2023.

Notorious prisoner Charles Bronson has branded the prison service a 'disgrace' after a delay to his public parole hearing means he will not be able to spend time with his mother for Christmas

In a handwritten letter to WalesOnline, Bronson called the delay 'jingle f*****g b*****ks', The Sun reports, as he expressed anger over not being able to spend time with his mother, Eira Peterson, a former pub lady from Aberystwyth.

He added: 'I've given these hypocrites years of good behaviour and they've given me nothing back. It's a disgrace and I'm sick of it.'

In the letter, Bronson also questioned whether he would be out in time for next Christmas, before brazenly writing 'there's one sure thing - I'll get out of here one day and it won't be in a body bag.'

His latest letter comes just days after he made a bombastic threat in a chilling note penned to a fan.

He said the first thing he would do if he gains his freedom is have 'a double bubble proper English fry-up' and then 'go collecting what's owing me from all the parasites that have sucked off me for four decades'.

The violent criminal ended the letter, published in The Sun, with a frightening: 'Should be fun! Be lucky.'

He signed off with the surname he now uses, 'Salvador'.

Bronson, pictured in 1997, said in his latest letter that he's 'given years of good behaviour and they've [the prison service] given me nothing back'

Bronson was first sent to prison in 1968, but has seen his initial sentence increased several times as a result of his violent behaviour, including assaulting other inmates and holding prison staff and other professionals hostage.

He was sentenced to a discretionary life term with a minimum of four years in 2000 after taking a prison teacher hostage for 44 hours in HMP Hull.

Other victims have included governors, doctors, staff and even his own solicitor.

Although the parole board has granted him a hearing, a date has not yet been set.

In a document setting out the decision to allow Bronson a public hearing, Parole Board Chairwoman Caroline Corby said it was 'in the interests of justice'.

In a letter penned earlier this month to a fan, Bronson said he would 'go collecting what's owing me' on his release and said the first thing he would enjoy was a 'proper' fry-up

Russell Causley, who murdered his wife, Carole Packman, in the 1980s and never revealed where he hid her body, is set to become the first prisoner in UK history to have a public Parole Board hearing.

He was freed in 2020 but sent back to jail last year after breaching his licence conditions.

The hearing was set for October but has since been delayed and is expected to take place within the next month.",Jingle b******s': Violent prisoner Charles Bronson rages over 'disgraceful' parole delay,0

Earlier this month, shocking Ring doorbell footage captured the moment an XL Bully mauled a cat to death

At the beginning of October, Ian Langley, 54, was set upon on the estate in Sunderland on October 3 this year by an enormous XL Bully dog which grabbed him by the neck as he bent down to pick up his Patterdale terrier pup.

The attack left Mr Langley needing CPR for around 15 minutes as emergency services fought to staunch heavy bleeding from his wounds. However he tragically succumbed to his injuries. His dog survived.

Mr Langley was the eighth person to be killed by XL Bullies this year.

Following yesterday's incident, Northumbria Police have confirmed a 22-year-old woman and a 31-year-old man were arrested on suspicion of being in charge of a dangerously out of control dog.

Two dogs as well as three other canines were seized.

An investigation is underway and both people remain in custody.

Detective Inspector Corrin Lowery of Northumbria Police said: 'I understand this incident will have caused some concern, but I would like to reassure residents and the wider community there is no risk at the time.

'A full investigation has been launched so we can establish a full, clear picture of events, and officers will remain the area today (SUN) speaking to residents and carrying out further enquiries.

'I would encourage anyone who is concerned or worried to make themselves known.

'The victim remains in hospital with serious injuries, and I wish her and her two dogs, a full recovery.

'The investigation is at an early stage but we do believe all those involved are known to each other. Two people remain in custody and a total of five dogs have been seized while we continue with our enquiries.

'We would ask that anyone who hasn't spoken to us yet, but has information, gets in touch.

'And I was also ask that people do not speculate about this incidents, especially on social media, while our work continues.'",Yet another savage XL Bully mauling leaves woman in hospital with serious injuries and two arrested in latest attack by crazed animal - as officials move to ban powerful breed,0

In court on Thursday, Justice Lee referred to Mr Sharaz as the Prophet Elijah ... There's a place for him at the passover table but he never turns up'.

On Friday, Mr Whybrow compared him to the elusive cartoon character, Where's Wally.

'He's everywhere but you can't find him in this,' he said.

Mr Whybrow pointed out that he was in meetings with Ms Higgins when she was discussing her allegations with journalists and police, and was often the conduit between them.

Mr Whybrow said: 'He's at the meeting, he's making all of these inputs - as my learned friend will no doubt refer to - this was a political hit job if you refer to the communications emanating from him.'

Justice Lee said: 'Let's assume, for the sake of argument, Mr Sharaz decided to seek out journalists he perceived as friendly ones and reached out to contacts in order to formulate what you describe as a political hit job in 2021, and weaponise his girlfriend's allegations.

'Let's assume that for present purposes this is true - and I express no view one way or the other - there's still the question of how that rationally bears upon the truth of the allegations in 2019.'

Mr Whybrow replied: 'It bears in this way … what is it that he was told, that makes him somebody they didn't want to call as a complaint witness.'

Justice Lee: 'I can see why he is a relevant witness to what occurred in 2021 but that's not really the justification case.'

When Mr Whybrow's submissions about the truth defence ended, Mr Richardson stood up and gave his closing submissions on Network Ten and Lisa Wilkinson's qualified privilege defence.

Mr Richardon said Mr Sharaz was by Ms Higgins' side during major meetings about her allegations - including when a screenshot of her bruise was taken at 8.45am on January 27, 2021.

Ms Higgins signed a statutory declaration confirming the photo was taken on April 3, 2019, and that the bruise was a result of her alleged rape.

However, she also said her phone was wiped and died prior to January 27, 2021, but that photo somehow survived when little else did.

'He is right there as this narrative of her complete phone death is spun,' Mr Richardson said.",Bruce Lehrmann defamation trial LIVE BLOG: Lisa Wilkinson's lawyer addresses claims Brittany Higgins 'took her clothes off' and lay waiting for Bruce Lehrmann - as lip reader reveals what he told her over drinks before alleged rape,0
