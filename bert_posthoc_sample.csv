Christopher C. Miller said in a statement released by the Defense Department on Monday afternoon: 'As is normal for military support to large security events, the Department will vet National Guardsmen who are in Washington, D.C.

'While we have no intelligence indicating an insider threat, we are leaving no stone unturned in securing the capital.

'This type of vetting often takes place by law enforcement for significant security events. However, in this case the scope of military participation is unique.'

His comments contradict remarks given on Sunday by Army Secretary Ryan McCarthy, who has told commanders to be on the lookout for any problems within their ranks as the inauguration approaches.

Some 25,000 National Guardsmen are being brought to DC to protect the event. It comes as more and more people - including law enforcement officers and military personnel - are arrested over the January 6 riot at the Capitol.

Members of the US National Guard leave the US Capitol to take positions outside after an ""external security threat"" prior to a dress rehearsal for the 59th inaugural ceremony for President-elect Joe Biden and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris, at the US Capitol on January 18, 2021 in Washington, DC

Preparations take place before a rehearsal for President-elect Joe Biden's Presidential Inauguration at the U.S. Capitol in Washington, Monday, Jan. 18, 2021

Earlier on Monday, a rehearsal for the inauguration had to be called off and everyone in attendance evacuated earlier in the day due to an 'external security threat' that turned out to be a fire started by a homeless woman under a nearby bridge.

Acting US Secretary of Defense Chris Miller said on Monday there was 'no intelligence' of a threat

Military personnel and staffers ran from the temporary seating on the Capitol Building's West Front while an evacuation warning played in the background shortly after an 'explosion' was heard at around 10.30am.

As they panicked and ran for cover, plumes of smoke rose above the Capitol Building, where thousands of armed protesters staged an attempted coup on January 6.

Journalists at the scene reported being told of an 'external security threat' and people working in the Capitol Complex were told to stay away from windows and doors.

Less than an hour later, the fire department revealed that the chaos was caused by a homeless woman who unwittingly caused an explosion by using propane gas in her tent.

It caused a huge fire beneath a freeway on H Street South East, which is a stone's throw from the Capitol, and was the source of the black smoke that had terrified people on the hill.

The scare comes amid growing fears of an insider attack on the Biden inauguration while the nation still reels from the Capitol Building riot on January 6. Pentagon officials are concerned that an insider attack may be in the works.

All 25,000 of the National Guardsmen who will be there to protect the event are being vetted by the FBI.

The evacuation was first reported shortly after 10.40am.

'Overhead announcement to those of us in Inauguration rehearsals just now at the Capitol saying there’s an external security threat, no entry or exit, stay away from exterior windows & doors, if outside to seek cover,' one journalist at the scene tweeted.

The fire was started by a homeless woman who was using propane inside her tent. It caused an 'explosion' that was heard in the area. She was not seriously injured

The fire department tweeted less than an hour later: '#DCsBravest responded to an outside fire in the 100 block of H St SE that has been extinguished.

'There were no injuries. This accounts for smoke that many have seen.

'Update outside fire 100 block of H St SE. Fire involved a homeless tent beneath freeway. #DCsBravest quickly extinguished fire.

'Occupant indicated she was using propane, which may explain report of “explosion “. 1 individual with non life threatening injury.'

They did not specify what she was using the propane for. The woman did not want to be taken to the hospital.

Capitol police said in a statement that the incident had been 'contained' by that the area was still on lockdown.

'The Capitol Complex is currently in lockdown. All personnel are advised to stay indoors and away from windows and doors.'

The security for Wednesday's event will be on a larger scale than any other in recent history.

Over the weekend, the Capitol Police were heard practicing their emergency notification system over a loud speaker.

The warning said: 'This is a test of the US Capitol Police audible emergency notification system.'

Some 25,000 armed National Guardsmen will be in Washington DC for it. Many are already there and have been since the immediate aftermath of the January 6 MAGA mob riot.

But defense officials say they are now fearful of an insider attack that could threaten the event. All of the troops who will be in Washington to protect the event have to be vetted first by the FBI.

One Army reservist with 'secret' security clearance has already been arrested for his alleged part in the Capitol siege earlier this month.

Timothy Hale-Cusanelli, 30, of New Jersey was described in court papers as an 'avowed white supremacist and Nazi sympathizer' who allegedly 'encouraged' other violent rioters before being charged Friday.

Army Secretary Ryan McCarthy told The Associated Press on Sunday that officials are conscious of the potential inauguration threat, and warned commanders to be on the lookout for any problems within their ranks as the inauguration approaches.

So far, however, he and other leaders say they have seen no evidence of any threats, and officials said the vetting hadn't flagged any issues.

'We´re continually going through the process, and taking second, third looks at every one of the individuals assigned to this operation,' McCarthy said in an interview after he and other military leaders went through an exhaustive, three-hour security drill in preparation for Wednesday´s inauguration.

He said Guard members are also getting training on how to identify potential insider threats.

Hale-Cusanelli, the arrested army reservist with 'secret' security clearance, is alleged to have told other rioters to 'advance'.

He now faces charges including knowingly entering or remaining in a restricted building without lawful authority and disorderly conduct on Capitol grounds, The New York Post reports.

The FBI has released photos of seven MAGA mob rioters wanted for beating and tasing a police officer as they screamed 'kill him with his own gun' during the Capitol siege.

DC Metropolitan Police Officer Mike Fanone, 40, suffered a mild heart attack after being attacked during the violent January 6 siege at the US Capitol.

Fanone, who is a father-of-four, was among the officers who were overpowered and beaten while trying to stop the rioters from storming the building.

The FBI Washington Field Office has released images of the seven suspects they say were involved in the assault on Fanone.

The photos are from images and footage that were taken of the violence scenes at the Capitol.

Authorities are now seeking the public's help in identifying those suspects.

Less than two weeks ago, 15,000 armed protesters stormed the Capitol in an attempted coup while congress was certifying the election result

The FBI has released photos of seven MAGA mob rioters wanted for beating and tasering DC Metropolitan Police Officer Mike Fanone as they screamed 'kill him with his own gun' during the January 6 siege

In a press conference last week, Fanone described being attacked by the mob and said rioters had tried to grab his gun and yelled: 'Kill him with his own gun'.

Riley June Williams, of Harrisburg, was charged Sunday with entering a restricted building and disorderly conduct after she was videoed rioting inside the Capitol last week. She is now being investigated by the FBI

'It looked like a medieval battle scene,' Fanone, who rushed to the Capitol after hearing an urgent call for back-up on the radio, said

He was among the officers who tried to defend the West Terrace.

At the time, Fanone and his colleagues were unaware that protesters had already breached the Capitol and were inside.

He recalled being dragged away from the doors to the Capitol by rioters.

Photographs from the scene showed him screaming as he tried to fight them off.

Fanone said that he and his colleagues had mace sprayed in their faces, had their batons stolen and were then beaten with them.

'We were getting chemical irritants sprayed,' he said.

'They had pipes and different metal objects, batons, some of which I think they had taken from law enforcement personnel. They had been striking us with those.'

He said it was impossible to fight the crowd.

Fanone said some of the rioters tried to grab his gun and he feared they were going to shoot him. He said he believes he was only spared because he pleaded with rioters not to kill him for the sake of his children.

It came as a fugitive Pennsylvania worker was investigated for 'stealing' Nancy Pelosi's laptop.

In video footage captured by British broadcaster ITV, Williams can be seen inside the Capitol, wearing a green T-shirt and brown trench coat, holding a zebra-print bag

Williams is seen highlighted in the above image in a demonstration outside the Capitol on January 6

Riley June Williams, 22, of Harrisburg, was charged Sunday with entering a restricted building and disorderly conduct after she was filmed rioting inside the Capitol on January 6.

A court affidavit outlining Williams' alleged crimes suggests that she could soon face much more serious charges.

In the affidavit, FBI Agent John Lund said that a former romantic partner of Williams – identified only as W1 – had also come forward to tell the bureau she had stolen either a laptop or hard drive from Pelosi's office during the insurrection.

The witness told investigators that friends of Williams had played them a video that showed her stealing the device.

They further claimed that Williams, a care worker, then 'intended to send the computer device to a friend in Russia, who then planned to sell the device to SVR, Russia's foreign intelligence service.'

However, according to the witness the plan fell through for unknown reasons and Williams is either still in possession of the device or has since destroyed it.

The FBI said the matter remains under investigation as agents work to verify W1's allegations. For now, Williams is just facing charges of entering a restricted building and disorderly conduct.

Williams is believed to be still on the run from police after having allegedly fled from her home when a warrant was issued for her arrest.";True;1;0.9421745538711548;high_pos;0

Tuesday for a memorial honoring the American lives lost to coronavirus the night before his inauguration.

The former vice president will participate in a send-off event in his hometown of Wilmington, Delaware before he and his wife Jill Biden depart for the nation’s capital.

Biden and vice president-elect Kamala Harris will host a ceremony at the Lincoln Memorial Reflecting Pool on Tuesday evening to honor the nearly 400,000 American lives lost to the pandemic.

Tuesday’s events are an attempt to deflect from a potentially messy exit from the White House, as Trump will not participate in the usual pomp and circumstance of exchange of power – such as holding a private conversation with the incoming president, leaving a letter of advice or attending his replacement's inauguration.

He also could face a split-screen moment Wednesday as the House prepares to deliver the article of impeachment against Trump to the Senate – and several Democratic senators are eager to move forward with the proceedings.

Biden’s team is already trying to set a more serious and sympathetic tone in its response to the coronavirus pandemic.

The attempt to turn the focus from Trump to COVID will begin on Tuesday night.

Biden and Harris will lead a 'moment of unity and Remembrance' for the dead at 5:30 p.m. at the Lincoln Memorial. The reflecting pool in front of the memorial will be lit up for the first time, to honor the deceased.

Unprecedented: Biden's inauguration takes place with D.C. in lockdown and 25,000 National Guard troops deployed in the wake of the MAGA riot

The president-elect is asking Americans to light a candle in their window in honor of those who lost their lives to the deadly pandemic.

It is unclear if members of the Trump administration will attend the memorial.

On Wednesday, Biden will be sworn into office – and with the lack of any traditional greetings by the outgoing president, Biden will use his time before the inauguration ceremony to go to church.

Then on Thursday, he will attend a prayer service at Washington National Cathedral, which is expected to be dedicated to those who have died of COVID.

As of Tuesday morning, 399,003 Americans have lost their lives to the virus and more than 24 million have been infected since early last year.

With the traditions of inauguration upended by a combination of Trump's refusal to meet Biden at the White House, massive security in the wake of the MAGA riots, and Biden's insistence that the event be COVID safe, his team have carved out a new version which they hope will help take the focus off the outgoing president.

That will be a difficult task: Trump's impeachment trial in the Senate could begin as early as 1:00 p.m. on Wednesday, minutes after Biden is sworn in on the steps of the Capitol and exactly two weeks after the MAGA mob stormed it.

Preparations: Biden will be sworn-in Wednesday afternoon on the steps of the Capitol in an unusual private ceremony in light of the pandemic and emerging threats. The inauguration will be void of any of the traditional symbols of the transfer of power from one president to the next

Nearly 200,000 miniature American flags, dubbed the 'filed of flags', were placed on the National Mall in lieu of a live audience for the inauguration

President Donald Trump will not participate in any of the usual traditions of transfer of power, like meeting with Biden the morning of inauguration on Wednesday or attending his swearing in

Instead, Biden, who is regularly seen attending Sunday mass at his home parish of St Joseph on the Brandywine in Wilmington, Delaware, will go to mass in Washington on Wednesday morning before his inauguration

Lady Gaga will sing the national anthem. Amanda Gorman, who became the country's first Youth Poet Laureate in 2017, will read a poem she has written for the occasion called 'The Hill We Climb.' Jennifer Lopez and Garth Brooks also will perform. Shortly after 12 p.m., Chief Justice John Roberts will administer the oath of office. Biden will take the oath with his 127-year-old, 5-inch-thick family Bible, which will be held by his wife, Jill. Kamala Harris, the first woman, the first black and the first South Asian American vice president, will be sworn in by Justice Sonia Sotomayor, the first Latina member of the Supreme Court. Harris will be sworn in on two Bibles — one that belonged to a close family friend Regina Shelton who was like mother to her and another that belonged to Thurgood Marshall, one of her heroes. Biden will then give his inaugural address. After the swearing-in ceremony, Biden and Harris will take part in a Pass in Review with members of the military on the East Front of the Capitol. Then, Biden, Harris and their spouses will then go to Arlington National Cemetery to lay a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier. The Obamas, the Bushes and the Clintons will attend in a show of bipartisan unity.

Nearly 200,000 mini American flags were placed on the National Mall this week to take the place of a live audience for the inauguration.

With the mix of coronavirus and threats facing the incoming president and his administration, the ceremony was closed to the public and will instead consist of a small, invite-only socially-distanced audience.

Wednesday morning, Trump is set to leave the White House for Mar-a-Lago on board Air Force One. His demands for a military sendoff at Joint Base Andrews were nixed by the Pentagon.

Until now it had been traditional for the outgoing president and first lady to welcome the president-elect and his wife to the White House on the morning of inauguration, with the two leaders then going down Pennsylvania Avenue to the Capitol in the presidential limousine.

That was what happened in 2017, with the Trumps first going to a prayer service at St John's Episcopal Church on Lafayette Square opposite the White House - later to become notorious as the site of his Bible photo-op in June 2020 - before being welcomed to the White House by the Obamas.

But the Bidens will not be welcomed at the White House and instead, the president-elect will go to Mass.

It is unclear which church he will attend on Tuesday. Only one Catholic church, St Patrick's close to Metro Center in downtown D.C. will be inside the massive security zone being thrown around the White House, National Mall and Capitol.

After being sworn in, Biden will once again turn to remembering the dead, this time fallen troops, by driving to Arlington National Cemetery with former presidents Bill Clinton, George W. Bush and Barack Obama to lay a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier.

Jimmy Carter, 96 and his wife Rosalynn, who have spent the pandemic largely at their home in Plains, GA, will not attend.

The ceremony at Arlington may provide a jarring split screen moment if the Senate trial of Trump begins at 1pm.

It will also serve to underline the support for the peaceful transfer of power from the former presidents who include Bush the sole living Republican former president.

And with the round of balls and concerts abandoned, Wednesday night will instead see a TV show hosted by Tom Hanks at 8.30pm on NBC, ABC, CBS and PBS as well as CNN and MSNBC.

The day after inauguration has traditionally featured a prayer service at National Cathedral but this time is likely to focus on praying for a nation traumatized by COVID and the Capitol riot.

Biden's non-traditional inauguration will be the start of a first day in office in which he will take an axe to many of Trump's signature policies.

Among the promises Biden has made include mask mandates, striking down the travel ban on predominantly Muslim countries, and having the United States rejoin the Paris Climate Accord.

While it's an ambitious plan, Biden plans on signing a handful of executive orders on his first day in office, per a memo from incoming chief of staff Ron Klain.

One of the executive orders Biden will sign is a reversal of the travel ban, which first affected people from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen when it was implemented in January 2017.

The order has been altered slightly since then, but has largely withstood legal challenges.

Another executive order Biden is planning on signing on his first day is an order that will have the United States rejoin the Paris Climate Accord.

The agreement signed in 2016 is a global pledge to reduce greenhouse gas emission and enact other environmentally-conscious policies.

Trump had the United States withdraw from the agreement in November 2019, becoming the most significant nation to no longer be party to the pact, drawing the ire of the rest of the globe.

'During the campaign, President-elect Biden pledged to take immediate action to start addressing these crises and build back better,' Klain wrote in a memo obtained by CNN.

'As president, he will keep those promises and sign dozens of executive orders, presidential memoranda, and directives to Cabinet agencies in fulfillment of the promises he made.'

Tradition: This was the scene in 2017 when the Obamas welcomed the Trumps to the White House before the inauguration of the 45th president. Instead the Bidens will first go to the White House after he is sworn in

Traditional solemnity: Presidents usually go to Arlington National Cemetery on the day of their inaugurations with the vice president - as Obama did with Biden in 2013 - but this time Biden will be joined by the former presidents coming to the inauguration, Bush, Clinton and Obama

Show business: Lady Gaga will sing the National Anthem at the inauguration and Tom Hanks will host a primetime TV special taking the place of balls and parties

Other executive orders Biden wants to sign right away include a halt of evictions during the pandemic, a pause on student loan payments during the pandemic, and a mandate requiring the wearing of face masks on federal properties and in federally-controlled jurisdictions, which includes interstate planes, trains and buses.

Biden also has listed a thorough immigration policy and a $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief bill among his top priorities.

Biden previously said he would roll back the Migrant Protection Protocols on his first day, which turn away many Central American refugees at the Mexican border.

Whether or not he does so could become critical in the coming days, with reports of Honduran migrants working their way through Guatemala and slowly towards the US border emerging.

In addition to his many executive orders and policy priorities, Biden also has his eye on his first overseas trip as president.

The Sunday Telegraph reports that Biden is planning on making the United Kingdom the site of his first trip outside of North America, which would be considered a boost to Prime Minister Boris Johnson.

'Joe's view will be that they'll have the destiny of the world on their shoulders so he'll want to overcome any political differences,' a friend of Biden's said to the Telegraph, in regards to Biden's previous opposition to Brexit.

According to his chief of staff, Biden has plans to sign up to about a dozen executive orders

A United Nations climate change conference is scheduled to take place in Glasgow, Scotland in the fall of 2021, meaning Biden could end up visiting the United Kingdom more than once this year.

Trump and Johnson tapped into similar sentiments within their countries, but the relationship between the two nations during their tenures has not been rock solid.

Because of Brexit, the two nations are working on a new trade deal, which isn't expected to be in place before 2022.

Jean Carroll for defamation;"A court verdict in May ordered Trump to pay Carroll $5million in damages

The former US president, 77, is facing cases with Stormy Daniels and Jean Carroll

Donald Trump's lawsuit suing his sexual assault victim E. Jean Carroll for defamation means he is now facing seven ongoing court cases.

The former US president, 77, faces juggling all of the cases as he heads into the 2024 primaries in his bid to retake the White House.

Carroll testified that Trump raped her in a department store in New York City in the mid-1990s - and he called her a liar when she went public with the information in 2019.

Trump claims that Carroll falsely accused him of rape, despite the fact that a jury in a civil trial in May found that he sexually abused and defamed the former Elle magazine advice columnist.

The verdict ordered Trump to pay $5million in damages.

Donald Trump's (pictured yesterday) lawsuit suing his sex assault victim E. Jean Carroll (pictured right, arriving in court in May) for defamation means he is now facing seven ongoing court cases

He is seeking a retraction of the ruling, as well as unspecified compensatory and punitive damages.

But Carroll's lawyer Roberta Kaplan said that his retaliation was 'nothing more than his latest effort to delay accountability'.

Here's a breakdown of the barrage of legal troubles the former president is facing:

The Stormy Daniels hush-money case

Trump was charged with 34 felony counts of falsifying business records in relation to the Stormy Daniels (pictured in May) hush-money scheme

Trump was charged with 34 felony counts of falsifying business records in relation to the Stormy Daniels hush-money scheme in the run-up to the 2016 presidential election.

His ex-lawyer Michael Cohen reportedly arranged a payment of $130,000 to Daniels to stop her disclosing her 2006 tryst with the ex-president. Trump has denied the affair.

On March 30, he made history and became the first former president to ever be indicted.

He returned to New York on April 4 for his day in court - with both pro and anti-Trump demonstrators surrounding the courthouse.

He pleaded not guilty at the New York Criminal Court, as the 16-page indictment was unsealed. Additionally, a 13-page statement of facts was released by the Manhattan district attorney's office.

It said that between August of 2015 to December of 2017, Trump 'orchestrated a scheme with others to influence the 2016 presidential election by identifying and purchasing negative information about him to suppress its publication and benefit the Defendant's electoral prospects.'

The alleged crimes included writing monthly checks to his former lawyer Michael Cohen throughout 2017 as part of a 'retainer agreement,' with prosecutors saying that there was no such retainer agreement and those payments were actually to pay Cohen back the $130,000 given to Daniels to keep her quiet.

Trump's role in pushing election fraud claims and plugs for the January 6 Capitol attack

The committee made its case that Trump was pressuring Mike Pence to throw results back to the states in an attempt to overturn the election

On the morning of January 6, 2021, Trump addressed his supporters on the Ellipse - the area right outside the White House.

Later that day a mob marched to the Capitol and broke into the building to stop the certification of President Joe Biden's win in the Electoral College.

The Department of Justice is running an investigation into Trump's role in pushing false election fraud claims and the January 6 Capitol attack plugs under the portfolio of Special Counsel Jack Smith.

In late April, Vice President Mike Pence testified in front of the federal grand jury assembled to hear evidence from the probe.

Pence had resisted - claiming privilege as the president of the Senate - and a judge acknowledged some of those claims, but green-lit the testimony to go forward.

Trump's legal team had also tried to stop Pence's testimony, but didn't succeed.

That setback comes after the Justice Department said in March that Trump can be sued by injured Capitol Police officers and Democratic lawmakers over January 6, in a federal court case testing Trump's legal vulnerability over his speech before the riot.

The Justice Department told a Washington federal appeals court in a legal filing that it should allow the lawsuits to move forward, rejecting Trump's argument that he is immune from the claims.

In December, before Republicans took control of the House, the House-based January 6th Committee referred Trump to the Department of Justice to pursue at least three criminal charges, including inciting an insurrection.

The recommended charges concerned four criminal statutes: obstructing an official proceeding, making false statements, defrauding the U.S. and inciting an insurrection.

It's unclear if more charges are on the table.

In a series of high-profile hearings last year on the aftermath of the 2020 election, which Trump falsely claims he won, the committee made its case that he was pressuring Pence to throw results back to the states in an attempt to overturn the election.

Pence did not testify to the Congressional committee, but a number of other top officials did - including Pence's chief of staff Marc Short, Ivanka Trump, Jared Kushner, former Attorney General Bill Barr and Roger Stone.

The classified documents Trump took from the White House to Mar-a-Lago when he left office

Trump is facing a total of 37 felony charges for allegedly illegally retaining classified records after leaving office in January 2021. Pictured: Boxes of documents stacked in his bathroom

Trump is facing a total of 37 felony charges for allegedly illegally retaining classified records after leaving office in January 2021 in a probe headed by special counsel Jack Smith.

The FBI seized 11,000 documents from his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida in a court-approved search on August 8, including about 100 marked as classified.

Some were designated top secret, the highest level of classified information.

The department began its investigation after the National Archives, the U.S. agency responsible for preserving government records, tried to get Trump to return missing government property and received 15 boxes with classified documents mixed in.

Trump has accused the Justice Department of engaging in a partisan witch hunt and claims the documents he took were part of his personal records and were declassified when he left office.

Both Pence and Biden are also being probed for having classified documents amid the materials they brought home after leaving office.

Georgia's criminal probe into efforts to overturn the 2020 election

Last July, Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis' office revealed that the 16 individuals who posed as fake Electoral College electors were targets of her investigation (Willis is pictured in October)

He is also facing a criminal probe in Georgia over his efforts to overturn the 2020 election after he lost to Joe Biden.

A special grand jury was selected last May to consider evidence in a Georgia prosecutor's inquiry into Trump's alleged efforts to influence that state's election result.

The investigation focuses in part on a phone call Trump made to Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, a Republican, on January 2, 2021. Trump asked Raffensperger to 'find' the votes needed to overturn his election loss.

Additionally, last July, Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis' office revealed that the 16 individuals who posed as fake Electoral College electors were targets of her investigation.

Last week, the news broke that at least eight of those electors had agreed to immunity deals.

It will be Willis' decision - and not that of the grand jury - on whether to charge Trump with crimes.

Legal experts said Trump may have violated at least three Georgia criminal election laws: conspiracy to commit election fraud, criminal solicitation to commit election fraud and intentional interference with performance of election duties.

Trump could argue he was engaging in constitutionally protected free speech.

A California federal judge said in October in a separate lawsuit that Trump had knowingly made false voter fraud claims in a Georgia election lawsuit, according to emails the judge reviewed. It is not immediately clear what ramifications Trump could face from the ruling.

New York Attorney General Letitia James claims Trump inflated property values to mislead banks and investors

New York Attorney General Letitia James said in a civil lawsuit filed in February that her office uncovered more than 200 examples of misleading asset valuations by Trump and the Trump Organization

New York Attorney General Letitia James said in a civil lawsuit filed in February that her office uncovered more than 200 examples of misleading asset valuations by Trump and the Trump Organization between 2011 and 2021.

James accused Trump of inflating his net worth by billions of dollars to satisfy loan terms and get better insurance coverage.

Mar-a-Lago was valued as high as $739 million when it should have been close to $75 million, the 200-page lawsuit against the Trump Organization claims.

Trump withdrew his own countersuit against James in January after a judge accused him of using the courts to seek revenge.

He and his lawyers were ordered to pay almost $1 million by a judge in Florida for suing Hillary Clinton and others over his claims that the 2016 election was rigged.

James is seeking to permanently bar Trump, his sons Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump and his daughter Ivanka Trump from running companies in New York state, and to prevent them and his company from buying new properties and taking out new loans in the state for five years.

James is also seeking to have the defendants disgorge around $250 million that she described as obtained through fraud.

After James announced the lawsuit, Trump in a social media post called the action 'Another Witch Hunt.'

A lawyer for Trump called the lawsuit's claims 'meritless.'

James said her probe also uncovered evidence of criminal wrongdoing, which she referred to federal prosecutors and the Internal Revenue Service for investigation.

Trump appeared back in New York for a deposition last month as part of the case.

New York criminal probe into Trump Organization's 'tax-free perks' to top executives

Chief financial officer Allen Weisselberg, also named as a defendant in the James lawsuit, has pleaded guilty

The Trump Organization is on trial in New York on criminal tax fraud charges.

The Manhattan district attorney's office last year accused the Trump Corporation and Trump Payroll Corp. of giving executives tax-free perks such as rent-free apartments, school tuition fees and leased luxury cars.

Its former chief financial officer Allen Weisselberg, also named as a defendant in the James lawsuit, has pleaded guilty and is required to testify against the company as part of his agreement with prosecutors.

Alvin Bragg, the Manhattan district attorney, has also been investigating whether Trump misled lenders and others about asset valuations.

Jackie Stuart was beaten and stabbed by inmates during a siege at Peterhead Prison, Aberdeenshire, in September 1987.

The incident only ended when SAS troops stormed the building and rescued Mr Stuart.

The then 57-year-old gained international recognition when TV footage showed him being dragged across the roof on a chain by a prisoner.

He went on to write a book about his ordeal, Hostage on the Roof – and was instrumental in setting up Peterhead Prison Museum, which opened in 2016, where he would regularly recount his experience to visitors.

The museum yesterday hailed him a ‘hero’ as it posted a notice on its social media page informing visitors of his passing.

Alex Geddes, the museum’s operations manager, paid tribute to a ‘strong-willed and inspirational’ man who will be ‘sadly missed’.

He said meeting Mr Stuart, who was originally from Aberdeen, and hearing him recount the 1987 siege was the ‘icing on the cake’ for thousands of visitors.

He said: ‘His voice is carried on the audio tour, and always will be. He is now captured in history.

'We are deeply saddened, but for him we will continue to drive the museum forward.’

Mr Stuart was beaten by inmates, who were serving life sentences for violent crimes, after 50 prisoners seized control of the building’s D-wing, taking him and another guard hostage.

The other guard was freed soon after but Mr Stuart was held captive without food or water on the roof for five days.

The SAS, kitted out in full body armour, fireproof overalls and respirators, stormed the building in the early hours.

On each of the three floors of D-wing, an SAS team fought their way in with explosives, hurling in CS gas and stun grenades, before rushing in to clear the cells.

They were also equipped with wooden batons, 9mm Browning pistols, ‘flashbang’ grenades and tear gas canisters.

Speaking in 2016, Mr Stuart said: ‘They [the inmates] got a big chain off a punching bag and put it round my neck and dragged me about and they filled my pockets with lighter fluid and said they would set me alight if they didn’t get what they wanted.

The order prohibits him from referring to those involved in his election interference case, such as by calling prosecutors - special council Jack Smith and his staff - 'fascist thugs', or advising those testifying against him to keep quiet.

The gag order - a set of restrictions on what Trump is allowed to say publicly about the given legal proceedings to which he pleads not guilty - was imposed by Judge Tanya Chutkan, overseeing the federal case against him for allegedly trying to overturn the 2020 election, in October.

She has restricted statements that 'target' prosecutors, court personnel and witnesses, which prosecutors argue could endanger people involved in the trial.

But the gag order - temporarily lifted during Trump's appeal - will run up against First Amendment protections guaranteeing free speech.

The former president has denounced the charges, which came after the January 6 riot, as 'a persecution of a political opponent'.

The country's premier civil liberties group - the American Civil Liberties Union - has criticized the gag order, despite hardly being a historic ally of Trump's.

'The entire order hinges on the meaning of the word ""target"",' it has written. 'But that meaning is ambiguous.'

Chutkan did, while imposing the gag order, recognize Trump's right to criticize his White House successor, Joe Biden, whom the Republican frontrunner will likely face in next year's presidential election, given current polling.

But Trump's lawyers have argued that the restrictions on him in the trial, set to start in March, will have an undue influence on his 2024 campaign. The Iowa Republican Caucus is set for January.

'The Gag Order installs a single federal judge as a barrier between the leading candidate for President, President Donald J. Trump, and every American across the country,' his lawyers wrote.

To clarify the restrictions on Trump, Chutkan cited a post that Trump made on his Truth Social website questioning whether his former chief of staff Mark Meadows took an immunity deal to testify against him, saying only 'weaklings and cowards' would do so.

The judge said that sort of speech should be restricted.

Prosecutors argue that some of Trump's statements about his trial 'consist of ad hominem attacks using inflammatory language likely to arouse angry or violent feelings in the listener, rather than reasoned argument.

'These are precisely the sorts of statements that pose a substantial likelihood of material prejudice to the proceedings,' they said, arguing that the gag order is clear on what is and isn't allowed.

Trump has a 'pattern,' they argue, 'stretching back years, in which people publicly targeted by the defendant are... subject to harassment, threats and intimidation.'

Catherine Ross, a professor at the George Washington University Law School, told CNN she doubted Trump's appeal would succeed in rescinding the gag order.

'It is a foundational principle that First Amendment rights to speak may sometimes have to give way to the integrity of the judicial process and the importance of guaranteeing a fair trial,' she said.

'This is a routine kind of limitation on criminal defendants.'

Trump's lawyers have argued that an alternative to the gag order could be to delay the trial until 2025 -- after next year's election.

But prosecutors say that will simply reward Trump for his 'egregious' statements.

Trump has also said that he will appeal a proposed trial date of March 5 - the day before the Super Tuesday primaries - as he called special council Smith 'deranged'.

It is just one of a number of motions Trump's lawyer John Lauro said he and his team would be filing with the court in an effort to stop or slow the prosecution.

Trump is accused of conspiring to obstruct an official proceeding, defraud the government, and disenfranchise voters, in a streamlined indictment stemming from his election overturn effort. Unlike in the related case where Trump was arrested in Fulton County, Georgia last week, Trump is not charged along with other defendants.

As she announced her decision on the calendar, Judge Chutkan invoked the historic Scottsboro Boys case, where nine African American boys accused of raping two white teens were tried just 6 days after indictment. 'This trial does not move the case forward with the haste of the mob,' she said.

She called Trump's case 'profoundly different.'

She said Trump was being represented by 'a team of zealous and experienced attorneys,' and said they had been given adequate time to prepare.

She said Trump 'has known about the government's investigation for nearly a year.'

'Let’s not overlook the fact that Mr. Trump has considerable resources that every criminal defendant does not usually have,' she said at one point.";True;1;0.9207531213760376;high_pos;0

Trump says Biden should free riot participants on third anniversary - arguing they acted 'patriotically and peacefully' while mocking Liz Cheney for her investigation of Capitol attack;"Former President Donald Trump marked the third anniversary of the January 6 Capitol attack by again demanding that the 'hostages' be released by President Joe Biden.

Trump brought up January 6 at both of his Iowa appearances Saturday on the campaign trail, saying at one of them that participants in the riot three years ago acted 'patriotically and peacefully.'

He also continued to go after former Rep. Liz Cheney, one of only two Republicans to participate in the House of Representatives' probe after the attack.

After a nearly three and half hour delay - due to a malfunctioning small private plane Trump's team had rented to get the ex-president shuttled between two smaller Iowa towns ahead of the January 15 caucuses - Trump took the stage Saturday night in Clinton, Iowa.

Trump charged Biden and the Democrats with turning the country into 'h***' and then added, 'you know what they outta do? They outta release the J6 hostages. They've suffered enough.'

'They outta release them,' the ex-president and 2024 GOP hopeful continued. 'I call them hostages, some people call them prisoners, I call them hostages.'

'Release the J6 hostages, Joe!' Trump said, his voice getting louder. 'Release them Joe! You can do them real easy, Joe.'

Biden kicked off his year of 2024 campaigning by delivering a speech Friday from Valley Forge, Pennsylvania in which he said 'we nearly lost America' on January 6.

He also called Trump 'sick' and a 'loser' during his remarks.

Since then, more than 1,265 defendants have been charged with crimes related to the attack in all 50 states and the District of Columbia, according to Justice Department figures.

Trump has long said he'd pardon participants if he got back into office.

At an earlier event in Newton, Iowa, the former president said the real 'insurrection' was the U.S. southern border crisis and floated that migrants did not act 'patriotically and peacefully, peacefully and patriotically' like the crowd of Trump supporters on January 6, 2021

The ex-president again went after former Rep. Liz Cheney, who spoke at Dartmouth on Friday in New Hampshire (pictured). Trump said Cheney had a case of 'Trump Derangement Syndrome.' 'I watch her on TV and she's shaking,' Trump said

At his earlier Iowa stop, in the town of Newton located outside of Des Moines, Trump said the current southern border crisis was a bigger issue than what happened on January 6.

'When you talk about insurrection - that, that's the real deal,' the ex-president commented.

He said migrants were not doing things 'patriotically and peacefully, peacefully and patriotically,' words Trump reserved for the masses on January 6.

At another point at his Newton event, Trump commented, 'nobody even thought J6 was even a possibility,' before attacking Cheney.

'She is a major case of Trump Derangement Syndrome,' he said. 'I watch her on television she's shaking,' he said, jiggling behind the podium to do an impression.

He then took credit for 'knock[ing] her out of office.'

'You know she lost by the largest margin in history for a congressperson, did you know that? Because any congressman, any congressman or woman, doing that badly would drop out of the race long before the race,' Trump said.

Cheney lost her Republican primary in the ultra-red Wyoming in August 2022 to now Rep. Harriet Hageman by more than 37 points, which did set records.

https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-10331413/Pentagon-finds-highest-number-active-service-members-engaging-extremism-ever.html;Pentagon finds highest number of active service members engaging in extremism ever;"Pentagon officials have issued new guidance to try and combat the rise in service personnel with extremist beliefs, after a sharp increase in members with worrying views.

The new guidelines, issued on Monday, come nearly a year after some current and former service members participated in the riot at the U.S. Capitol, triggering a broad department review. They outline what could constitute extremist activity - and warn that service members liking extremist posts on social media could find themselves being monitored as a result.

Around 100 members of the US military were confirmed to have been involved in some form of extremist activity over the last year - well up from the 'low double figures' number from the previous survey, The Pentagon announced.

However, Department of Defense officials warn that the number may grow given recent spikes in domestic violent extremism, particularly among veterans.

Monday's guidelines don't specifically ban service members from participating in extremist groups, because of their First Amendment right to free speech. They've been created to try and deter or dissuade members from joining in the first place, or becoming actively-involved, which can lead to punishment.

Among active service members accused of partaking in extremist activity is Marine Major Chris Warnagiris. He was the only active duty member of the military to have been charged for participating in the January 6 Capitol attack, so far.

He pleaded not guilty to multiple violent crimes, including physically assaulting or impeding officers at the Capitol, after 'push himself through' the doors of the Capitol East Rotunda, where officers are said to have 'lost ground' to rioters already inside the building who were attempting to open the doors.

Once inside and aiding other extremists in getting in, a police officer inside the Capitol attempted to shut the doors. However, Warnagiris allegedly resisted and instead confronted the officer, pushing him away to keep the door open, according to investigators' review of security and open-source videos from that day that is described in court documents.

Warnagis is now facing a superseding indictment. He has been a Marine since 2002 and was stationed at Camp Quantico, in Virginia, as of late.

A Board of Inquiry was held at Marine Corps Base Quantico earlier this year for Warnagiris to argue his case to stay in the Marine Corps. The outcome is pending.

Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin Defense Secretary, among several leaders, is doubling efforts to reduce extremism across the U.S. after it was evident that military veterans and some active service members were among the crowd at the January 6 insurrection

The Pentagon's new policy lays out in detail activities which could get personnel flagged as extremists. They range from advocating terrorism or supporting the overthrow of the government to fundraising or rallying on behalf of an extremist group or 'liking' or reposting extremist views on social media.

The rules also specify that commanders must determine two things in order for someone to be held accountable: that the action was an extremist activity, as defined in the rules, and that the service member 'actively participated' in that prohibited activity.

Anyone found to have actively participated in extremism faces punishment, although further details on what exactly could be done to an extremist service member have not been shared.

Previous policies banned extremist activities but didn't go into such great detail, and also did not specify the two-step process to determine someone accountable.

The Pentagon said it had drawn up the rules partly to offer specifics from service members, who have called for greater clarity on what they can and cannot do.

Pentagon officials shared new strict rules on Monday, banning active service members from participating in extremist activities. The new set of rules follows current and former service members participating in the riot at the U.S. Capitol, triggering a broad department review.

According to the Pentagon, around 100 military members are known to have engaged in proven cases of extremist activity in the past year. But they warn that the number may grow given recent spikes in domestic violent extremism, particularly among veterans. Pictured: Violent insurrections loyal to President Donald Trump try to break through a police barrier at the Capitol in Washington on Jan. 6, 2021

The Pentagon, in its report on extremism, said that available data generally shows that cases of prohibited extremist activity among servicemembers were rare. Among those who stormed the Capitol on January 6, 2021, was a group of camouflage-clad individuals, some of whom wore observable Oath Keeper patches (pictured)

The military has long been aware of small numbers of white supremacists and other extremists among the troops. But Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and other leaders launched a broader campaign to root out extremism in the force after it became clear that military veterans and some current service members were present at the Jan. 6 Capitol riots.

In a message to the force on Monday, Austin said the department believes that only a few service members violate their oath and participate in extremist activities.

But, he added, 'even the actions of a few can have an outsized impact on unit cohesion, morale and readiness - and the physical harm some of these activities can engender can undermine the safety of our people.'

The risk of extremism in the military can be more dangerous because many service members have access to classified information about sensitive military operations or other national security information that could help adversaries. And extremist groups routinely recruit former and current service members because of their familiarity with weapons and combat tactics.

The number of substantiated cases may be small compared to the size of the military, which includes more than 2 million active duty and reserve troops. But the number appears to be an increase over previous years where the totals were in the low two-digits. But officials also noted that data has not been consistent so it is difficult to identify trends.

The new rules do not provide a list of extremist organizations. Instead, it is up to commanders to determine if a service member is actively conducting extremist activities based on the definitions, rather than on a list of groups that may be constantly changing, officials said.

Asked whether troops can simply be members of an extremist organization, officials said the rules effectively prohibit membership in any meaningful way - such as the payment of dues or other actions that could be considered 'active participation.'

Pentagon spokesman John Kirby told reporters that 'there's not a whole lot about membership in a group that you're going to be able to get away with.' He added, 'In order to prove your membership you're probably going to run afoul of one of these criteria.'

Kirby also said that commanders will evaluate each case individually, so simply clicking 'like' on one social media post, for example, might not merit punishment depending on all the circumstances involved.

He also noted that the Pentagon does not have the ability or desire to actively monitor troops' personal social media accounts. Those issues would likely come up if reported to commanders or were discovered through other means.

The regulations lay out six broad groups of extremist activities and then provide 14 different definitions that constitute active participation.

Chansley was sentenced on Wednesday, Nov. 17, 2021, to 41 months in prison for his felony conviction for obstructing an official proceeding

Soon after taking office, Austin ordered military leaders to schedule a so-called 'stand-down' day and spend time talking to their troops about extremism in the ranks.

The new rules apply to all of the military services, including the Coast Guard, which in peacetime is part of the Department of Homeland Security. They were developed through recommendations from the Countering Extremist Activities Working Group. And they make the distinction, for example, that troops may possess extremist materials, but they can´t attempt to distribute them, and while they can observe an extremist rally, they can´t participate, fund or support one.

The rules, said the officials, focus on behavior, not ideology. So service members have whatever political, religious or other beliefs that they want, but their actions and behavior are governed.

In addition to the new rules, the Pentagon is expanding its screening for recruits to include a deeper look at potential extremist activities. Some activities may not totally prevent someone from joining the military, but require a closer look at the applicant.

The department also is expanding education and training for current military members, and more specifically for those leaving the service who may be suddenly subject to recruitment by extremist organizations.

https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jul/18/trump-letter-jan-6-jack-smith;Trump says he received target letter in federal January 6 investigation;"A new indictment for Donald Trump could be imminent after the former US president announced on Tuesday morning he had received a letter from special prosecutor Jack Smith identifying him as a “target” in the justice department’s investigation into the January 6 insurrection.

Trump, who is already facing criminal charges in Florida for illegally hoarding classified documents from his presidency, and prosecution in New York for a hush-money payment to an adult movie star, said his attorneys handed him the letter as he was having dinner on Sunday night.

“Deranged Jack Smith, the prosecutor with Joe Biden’s DOJ, sent a letter … stating that I am a TARGET of the January 6th Grand Jury investigation, and giving me a very short 4 days to report to the Grand Jury, which almost always means an Arrest and an Indictment,” Trump posted to his Truth Social website.

Smith, who is also the prosecutor in the classified documents case, has been looking into Trump’s efforts to remain in office following his 2020 election defeat to Joe Biden, including the deadly 6 January 2021 riot in which his supporters overran the Capitol building in Washington DC.

It is unclear what the specific charges could be, but the letter gives Trump until Thursday to exercise his option to appear before a grand jury in Washington.

People who receive target letters from federal authorities are often – but not always – indicted. They are also usually advised by their attorneys to not take up invitations to meet with the grand jury because any statements provided in that setting could be used to help build a case against them in the event that they’re charged.

The letter was, Trump insisted, “horrifying news” for the country, which he also claimed was an attempt by Biden to arrest “his number one political opponent”.

Trump currently leads in polling for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination by a wide margin.

Meanwhile, also Tuesday, the lawyer who advised Trump on overturning the 2020 election – John Eastman – reportedly indicated he had not received a target letter from the special counsel.

The statement came from Eastman’s attorney, Charles Burham, Politico’s Kyle Cheney reported.

Eastman was in the vanguard of lawyers plotting schemes involving “fake electors” and other ploys to help Trump thwart Biden’s presidential victory in 2020. The former California law professor is one of several lawyers whose legal stratagems have been heavily examined by Smith’s investigation into Trump and his allies’ efforts to block Biden from taking office.

Burham’s statement read: “Our client has received no target letter, and we don’t expect one raising concerns about illegality in the conduct of an election is not now and has never been sanctionable.”

The situation adds to Trump’s already perilous legal position as he pursues another run at the White House. As well as the Florida indictment, he has been charged in New York over an alleged hush-money payment to the adult movie star Stormy Daniels to remain quiet about their affair.

Trump is also under investigation in Fulton county, Georgia, for efforts to overturn his defeat to Biden there. A decision is expected shortly from the prosecutor, Fani Willis, whether to charge him over a phone call in which he attempted to persuade Georgia’s secretary of state to “find” him enough votes to win.

Georgia’s supreme court on Monday unanimously rejected a request by Trump to block Willis from prosecuting the case. His lawyers had argued that a special grand jury report that is part of the inquiry should be thrown out.

In his post on Tuesday, Trump repeated unfounded claims that all the legal moves against him were politically motivated.

“They have now effectively indicted me three times, with a probable fourth coming from Atlanta, where the DOJ are in strict, and possibly illegal, coordination with the district attorney, whose record on murder and other violent crime is abysmal,” he wrote.

“This witch hunt is all about election interference and complete and total political weaponization of law enforcement,” he added in all capital letters.

“It is a very sad and dark period for our nation.”

But Tuesday night, Trump joked about his legal challenges while campaigning in eastern Iowa.

Headlining a Republican county meeting, he attacked investigators while trying to make light of what could be his third criminal indictment since March.

“I didn’t know practically what a subpoena was and grand juries. Now I’m becoming an expert,” he told the audience at an Elks Lodge in Cedar Rapids.

News of the letter from Smith comes the same day a Trump-appointed judge in Fort Pierce, Florida, holds a hearing to determine a schedule for his classified documents trial.

Trump’s lawyers want to push the date beyond the 2024 election, while Smith’s team is pressing for a start date before the end of this year.

Even some of his closest staff were unaware that his show had been axed, reading about it for the first time on Twitter.

'No one I know was told about it beforehand. We were blindsided,' one senior staffer who works closely with Tucker's show, Tucker Carlson Tonight, told DailyMail.com.

Another insider revealed he still has no idea why he was let go so suddenly, and that many staffers are now questioning whether it's part of a wider plan by the Murdoch family to sell the media behemoth.

'Tucker still hasn't been given any indication of why he was taken off the air. His producer Justin Wells was fired too.

'We believe Rupert wants to sell the company and it's harder to find an institutional buyer with Tucker as the main star.

'Tucker gone makes it more of an appealing media company to buy,' the source said.

Tucker Carlson is out at Fox News after reigning over the network as one of its most beloved hosts for nearly a decade. He is shown on his final show on April 21

Last month, booking producer Abby Grossberg filed a lawsuit against Fox that detailed specific claims about Carlson's show

Grossberg tweeted that Carlson's departure is 'great for America'

The Los Angeles Times reports that it was a combination of Carlson's coverage of the January 6 riot and a recent lawsuit filed by Abby Grossberg, a former producer, who says she was subjected to sexism, bullying and anti-Semitism while working on the show.

The Times' sources say Rupert Murdoch gave the order for Carlson to be shown the door.

Grossberg told DailyMail.com that Carlson's firing looked to her like an 'admission' of guilty by the network.

'This is a step towards accountability for the election lies and baseless conspiracy theories spread by Fox News, something I witnessed firsthand at the network, as well as for the abuse and harassment I endured while Head of Booking and Senior Producer for Tucker Carlson Tonight,' Grossberg said.

'I think this is great for America! It's a big win for viewers of cable news, not just those who watch Fox.'

Grossberg's lead attorney, Gerry Filippatos, said Carlson's exit 'indicates an unexpected, but welcome, expression of contrition towards Ms. Grossberg that we welcome and put in the category of 'institutional change' that we require to move us closer towards an amicable resolution of Ms. Grossberg's lawsuits.

'We have duly noted that movement and thank Fox News for it.

'Today is a partial vindication for Ms. Grossberg, who was a journalist before she joined Fox News, and is now again after she was fired in retaliation for speaking the truth about the unlawful treatment she suffered there as a woman and a 'represented' witness under oath.'

Her other attorney, Tanvir Rahman, also of the firm Filippatos PLLC, said that Grossberg still planned to have Carlson deposed in her Southern District of New York (SDNY) federal lawsuit against him and Fox.

'Tucker Carlson's departure from Fox News is, in part, an admission of the systemic lying, bullying, and conspiracy-mongering claimed by our client, former top producer, Abby Grossberg,' Rahman said.

'Mr. Carlson and his subordinates remain individual defendants in the S.D.N.Y. case and we look forward to taking their depositions under oath in the very near term.'

Seemingly unaware of his looming fate, he signed off his final show on Friday enthusiastically with: 'That's it for us for the week, we'll be back!'

Justin Wells, his senior executive producer, has also confirmed his departure from the network.

Last month, Grossberg filed a lawsuit against Fox that detailed specific claims about Carlson's show.

She complained about the pace of working on his show, and said it drove her to require therapy.

Among allegations in her lawsuit - which Fox says it will vigorously contend - she recalled showing up to work for Carlson's show and finding 'many large and blown-up photographs of Nancy Pelosi in a plunging bathing suit revealing her cleavage.'

She also claimed producers on Carlson's show made repeated, sexist remarks about female guests - including Michigan gubernatorial candidate Tudor Dixon - and said they called the mother's room, where female employees can pump breastmilk, a 'waste of space'.

In a shock announcement Monday, the network announced Carlson would not be returning.

'FOX News Media and Tucker Carlson have agreed to part ways. We thank him for his service to the network as a host and prior to that as a contributor,' the network statement read.

An interim roster of hosts will take over in his absence until a permanent replacement is chosen. No other explanation has been given for his sudden departure after seven years at the top.

While liberals celebrated his departure, conservatives mourned his loss. Many of his die-hard viewers are now left wondering where to turn.

Shares in Fox Corp, the network's parent company, fell by 5 percent after the announcement - wiping $500 million from its market value.

Carlson's departure comes just five days after Fox settled with Dominion Voting Systems which had sued for defamation, claiming hosts like Carlson knew President Trump's election fraud claims were untrue, but pushed them for ratings.

Dominion sued for $1.6billion and settled for $787million at the 11th hour, narrowly avoiding an embarrassing and highly-publicized trial where Carlson and other hosts would likely have been called as witnesses.

His departure also comes just four days after that of Dan Bongino, and several months after Fox 'parted ways' with President Trump's daughter-in-law Lara.

Among discovery submitted before the trial were text messages in which Carlson described his 'passionate' hatred of President Trump.

Carlson's show, Tucker Carlson Tonight, was the gleaming jewel of Fox's nightly line-up, drawing in 3.5million viewers every night.

But a series of recent controversies including the Dominion claims and his own comments about the January 6 riots led him into hotter water than even he was used to.

It's unclear how long he had left on his contract, or whether Fox will pay severance.

A spokesman did not immediately respond to DailyMail.com's inquiries.

A 2020 report by CNN's Brian Stelter listed his salary as $10million-a-year.

Carlson joined Fox as a contributor in 2009, having previously offered his conservative opinions on CNN shows.

He was given his own show on the network in 2016 and quickly became its most watched host, cementing his own fanbase and reputation for taking some of the most extreme, hard-right positions on cable news.

In recent years, it has been dubbed by liberal media 'the most racist show on cable'.

Advertisers boycotted as he grew more controversial, but Fox watched as the ratings soared.

Last week, his Thursday 8pm show attracted nearly 500,000 more viewers than Sean Hannity, Fox's second most watched host, in the 9pm hour.

In 2010, he created the conservative news site The Daily Caller. He sold his stake in 2020, three years after being given his own Fox News show.

After the announcement of Carlson's departure on Monday, shares in Fox Corp - Fox News' parent company - fell by 4 percent from $33.71 to $31.86.

Rupert Murdoch is yet to comment on his departure.

Tucker was largely spared from his wrath in the Dominion filings.

In one, the News Corp titan instead said Hannity and Laura Ingraham had perhaps 'gone too far' in their coverage of Trump's election fraud claims, but Carlson wasn't mentioned.

He has never hidden his disdain for the president.

In a 2016 article for Politico, Carlson called him 'shocking' and 'vulgar'. He resisted having him on his show repeatedly, instead interviewing him on occasion during Trump's presidency.

Hard-line conservatives were quick to commiserate.

Steve Bannon, on his podcast show, said: 'Tucker was the mainstay of the populist voice over at Fox.

'The reason to watch Fox, you've got Maria (Bartiromo) in the morning, Jesse (Watters), he is getting there, but Tucker's really the reason.

'With this, I don't know any reason to watch the Murdoch empire.'

Donald Trump Jr. tweeted: 'Tucker Carlson out at Fox News. OMG.'

While conservatives mourned him, liberals like those at The View celebrated the announcement gleefully.

Whoopi Goldberg announced the news, before Ana Navarro - one of the panel's few Republican hosts - led the audience in a chant of 'hey, hey, hey, goodbye!'

Carlson's departure from Fox wasn't the only media-shaking announcement of the morning.

Shortly after his ousting was announced, CNN's Chris Licht announced the firing of embattled host Don Lemon from the network.

Trump began his remarks by going after President Joe Biden, but soon went down memory lane talking about Hillary Clinton and former Vice President Dick Cheney.

'I did everything right and they indicted me,' he complained while surrounded by supporters in front of his clubhouse after spending his day dealing with the criminal justice system.

He blasted prosecutors for 'threatening me with 400 years in prison for possessing my own presidential papers' – brushing aside the indictment, which accuses him of willfully maintaining national security information at properties including the Bedminster, New Jersey club where he spoke.

That could be the total length of the sentence if Trump were to be convicted of each count against him, in what he termed 'a political persecution like something out of a fascist or communist nation.'

'I did everything right and they indicted me,' fumed former President Donald Trump at his Bedminster golf club after pleading not guilty in federal court in Miami

He claimed Biden would go down in history as 'the president who together with a band of his closest thugs, misfits and Marxists tried to destroy American democracy.'

That is a charge the House January 6 committee leveled at him about his election overturn effort. Federal prosecutors doing their own probe appear to be moving with haste.

He pointed to the use of the 1917 Espionage Act to go after him for alleged violations of willful possession of national security information, after the indictment said he had nuclear information at Mar-a-Lago and claimed to have Pentagon attack plans at the Bedminster club where he was speaking.

Trump termed it 'one of the most outrageous and vicious legal theories ever put forward in an American court of law.'

The former president suggested that other political figures had gotten away with much worse.

'He lost the nuclear codes,' Trump claimed of Bill Clinton, who he called a 'nice guy.'

'They should have used him a little bit more as an adviser in the 2016 election,' Trump also joked, alluding to how he beat Clinton's wife Hillary in the presidential election that year.

Trump also charged that George W. Bush's White House 'lost 22 million emails.'

'A document shredding truck was spotted on the way to Dick Cheney's house. Can you imagine?' the former president added.

He spoke at length about the Bill Clinton 'socks' case, which fact-checkers have already said isn't a valid comparison to what Trump is accused of doing.

Once again, Trump spoke at length about Special Counsel Jack Smith, who in addition to heading the classified documents probe is running a probe based out of Washington on Trump's election overturn efforts and January 6.

He termed him a 'raging lunatic' and said 'he looks like a thug.'

Smith could be seen staring at Trump inside the courtroom during the historic proceeding.

Trump said Smith compared unfavorably with Special Counsel Robert Hur, who is investigating documents found at Biden's home and office. He called Hur a 'very nice person.'

'Mine's not such a nice person. Mine's a deranged lunatic,' Trump said.

The former president claimed he had an 'absolute right' to declassify documents, even as the federal indictment included a taped transcript of him discussing having 'highly classified' information at the club.

'As president, I could have declassified, but now I can't,' he said in the recording.

'We will obliterate the Deep State,' Trump vowed, after polling showed his support jumped and held after criminal indictments in New York dealing with the Stormy Daniels 'hush' payments and in federal court in Florida over national security documents

There was a split-screen moment as Trump railed against prosecutors and President Joe Biden spoke on the South Lawn of the White House for a Juneteenth celebration.

At one point Fox News showed images of both men.

Trump called the charges against him 'fabricated,' as his legal team prepares to bulk up to battle the charges in federal court before a judge Trump appointed.

Although Biden's Attorney General Merrick Garland appointed Smith, Trump accused Biden of having 'political opponents arrested' right 'in the middle of a presidential election, in which he is losing very badly.'

When Trump paused to take a swig out of a bottle of water a member of the crowd shouted 'Happy Birthday!' at him.

He turns 77 Wednesday.

'Nice birthday isn't it?' the ex-president commented.

Trump grinned as a crowd of supporters sang 'Happy Birthday' to him.

'Nice birthday. Wonderful birthday,' he said.

'I was with Eric and Lara and the kids - ""Happy Birthday grandpa!"" - I said oh great, I just got charged with, they want 400 years approximately, if you add them all up. A fake 400 years. So thank you darling, that's so nice. It's a wonderful birthday,' the former president continued. 'We're going to make it into the greatest birthday of all.'

Trump addressed a key photographic image from the indictment – material from a box allegedly containing 'five eyes' classified information all over the floor of a room of his club.

He spoke of the room 'where someone not me – I wonder who it might have been – dumped one of the very neatly arranged boxes all over the floor.

Trump called the images 'staged.'

He said boxes contained 'clothing, memorabilia and much much more.'

'I hadn't had a chance to go through all the boxes. It's a long, tedious job. It's a long time, which I was prepared to do but I have a very busy life. I've had a very busy life,' he said.

Trump spoke of the room 'where someone not me – I wonder who it might have been – dumped one of the very neatly arranged boxes all over the floor. The indictment contained extraordinary new photos and detailed how Trump valet Walt Nauta walked into a storage room and allegedly found intelligence files on allies including the United Kingdom and Australia spilled on the floor

Eric Trump was spotted in the audience at the Bedminster event and Kimberly Guilfoyle, the fiancee of Donald Trump Jr., was captured in photos, but former first lady Melania Trump wasn't at the scene.

'I don't know. I haven't been briefed on that,' Trump spokesman Steven Cheung told DailyMail.com when asked about Melania's whereabouts at the conclusion of the event.

Other recognizable Trumpworld figures in the audience included Ric Grenell, Boris Epshteyn, Sebastian Gorka, Sen. Tommy Tuberville, Mike Lindell and Bernie Kerik.

Droves of members of the group Vietmanese Americans for American First were also in attendance, with all the women in the group sporting matching MAGA dresses.

At least one audience member brought a homemade 'Happy Birthday' sign.

Cheung said Trump is expected to spend his birthday celebrating with his family.

'Defiant. One word - defiant,' Cheung answered when asked by reporters about Trump's mood throughout the unprecedented day.

He said the speech allowed for Trump to 'lay down the marker of how he wants to frame the entire case.'

The spokesman also characterized it as a win for Trump's 2024 campaign.

'All eyeballs were on the coverage,' Cheung said. 'There is no oxygen for anything else or anyone else.'

'What did the other candidates do today?' the aide added.

Earlier, Trump left federal court and went straight to Miami's iconic Cuban restaurant Versailles where he offered to buy food for everyone and listened to customers sing 'Happy Birthday'.

The former president, who turns 77 tomorrow, prayed with religious leaders, took a photo with mixed martial arts fighter Jorge Masvidal and ripped a 'government that's out of control.'

'Food for everyone!' Trump shouted in the famous eatery in the surprise stop after he pleaded not guilty to 37 federal charges related to his mishandling of classified documents.

'Some birthday. We got a government that's out of control,' Trump fumed.

'I think it's going great,' he said as he made his way through supporters on the day where he was fingerprinted, arrested and became the first president to appear in front of a judge charged with a federal crime.

'I think it's a rigged deal here,' he added. 'I'm going to make a little speech tonight in Bedminster and I hope you're going to be there,' the ex-president also said.

Both Trump and his aide Walt Nauta were charged in a scheme to keep classified documents at Mar-a-Lago. Nauta walked alongside Trump at Versailles.

The display of bravado came after Trump unsurprisingly tried to monetize the indictment by soliciting campaign contributions.

'Crooked Joe Biden and his Department of Injustice attempting to silence and imprison their opponent – a completely INNOCENT man – all in the name of maintaining their regime's grip on power,' according to one Trump fundraising email.

In court earlier, the 76-year-old pleaded not guilty to 37 counts after being booked and fingerprinted in the downtown Miami court complex.

Special Counsel Jack Smith, who is handling the case for the Department of Justice, was seated in the front row of U.S. Magistrate Judge Jonathan Goodman's courtroom, while the ex-president was seated with his lawyers.

Trump has called Smith a variety of names, including a 'deranged psycho.'

The court case kicked off just before 3 p.m. EST. Trump was released and no bond was set. After about 20 minutes of arguing by opposing lawyers, the court ruled that the ex-president can't talk to witnesses, including Nauta, about the case.

Trump keeps his passport and remains free to travel.

Earlier the former commander-in-chief was arrested and fingerprinted, but was not handcuffed and no mugshot was taken.

The booking procedure wrapped up shortly before 2:30 p.m.

The back-and-forth about a list of witnesses whom Trump can't interact with hints at some of the complexities of the case.

A raft of government witnesses includes Trump employees at Mar-a-Lago.

The stunning indictment released last week includes information that came from Trump lawyer Evan Corcoran.

Nauta remains a close aide who according to the indictment exchanged messages with Trump family members about boxes and flights.

Trump's lawyers, Chris Kise and Todd Blanche, argued that he needs to be able to be in contact with people in his employ.

The court's compromise allows Trump to speak with people who are witnesses in the case but not talk with them about the case itself.

When Trump's hearing was complete, there was still more drama to come. A man decked out in old-fashioned prison garb jumped in front of the former president's motorcade, only to be steered away by law enforcement.

Then, the president's motorcade made a beeline to the famed Versailles restaurant in Miami.

Crowds cheered Trump outside the Cuban restaurant, a regular on the political circuit. Trump greeted supporters inside the restaurant, while supporters inside changed 'U.S.A.!'

The former president's motorcade left Trump National Doral Miami and took off on the journey downtown where hundreds of MAGA supporters and protesters were there to greet him.

During the drive Trump shared his fury with a Truth Social post saying: 'ON MY WAY TO COURTHOUSE. WITCH HUNT!!! MAGA.'

Nauta, the loyal aide who prosecutors say helped Trump move documents around Mar-a-Lago, was in the motorcade with him awaiting his own appearance in front of the judge.

The 76-year-old is facing 37 federal charges related to his handling of classified documents that included U.S. nuclear secrets and intelligence on foreign countries.

The allegations were revealed in the bombshell federal indictment unsealed on Friday - and included photos of boxes of sensitive files scattered around Mar-a-Lago.

His supporters and protesters started swarming the courthouse on Tuesday morning, waiting for his showdown with a judge.

Trump brought a number of loyal aides to Miami with him including Jason Miller, Boris Epshteyn and Margo Martin.

Outside the courthouse, Trump lawyer Alina Habba blasted the prosecution – as well as Trump probes underway in other jurisdictions. 'Destruction of the longstanding American principles that have set this country part for so long.

In recent years, we have seen the rise of politically motivated prosecutors who don't care for impartiality don't care for due process for equal protection of laws,' she said.

'They have been quietly, but aggressively cultivating a two-tiered system of justice. From the Russia hoax to the attorney generals to the corrupt Das in Georgia and New York. And now this. The people in charge of this country do not love America. They hate Donald Trump.'

Republican presidential hopeful Vivek Ramaswamy called on all presidential candidates to vow they would pardon Trump during a press conference outside.

He said that he would quash any conviction against the former president for mishandling classified documents, obstructing justice and making false statements

Trump, meanwhile, took to his Truth Social platform to rail against Special Counsel Jack Smith, who is leading the Department of Justice's case.

'This is the Thug, over turned consistently and unanimously in big cases, that Biden and his CORRUPT Injustice Department stuck on me. He's a Radical Right Lunatic and Trump Hater, as are all his friends and family, who probably 'planted' information in the 'boxes' given to them. They taint everything that they touch, including our Country, which is rapidly going to HELL!,' he complained.

There were only a handful of people on hand early in the morning but officials expected that number to increase as the time of Trump's arrival got closer.

One of the early arrivals was a group wearing 'Blacks for Trump' t-shirts.

Another man, wearing the American flag, carried a stick with a pig's head through it.

Many of Trump's supporters were coordinating their movements on Twitter.

Kari Lake, the failed Arizona gubernatorial candidate who is a huge supporter of the former president, tweeted that she will be joining protesters Tuesday.

Reporters lined up to get one of the 300 seats in the overflow room inside the courthouse. Only 20 journalists and members of the public will be let inside the actual courtroom where Trump will be arraigned.

Meanwhile, Reuters/Ipsos poll released on Monday found that 81 percent of Republicans thought the charges against Trump were politically motivated.

The poll also found that Trump still leads his rivals for the GOP presidential nomination by a wide margin.

The Queensland leader, dubbed a 'part-time Premier' by her critics, travelled over the border to the star-studded festival featuring American rapper Lizzo, English rocker Sam Fender and Russian feminist outfit Pussy Riot.

It comes at a time when the Sunshine State is in the midst of multiple crises with youth crime rates spiralling out of control, the healthcare system panned as the worst in Australia and cost-of-living pressures triggering a rental shortage.



The outing also echoes a similar Labor Party controversy in 2016 when Ms Palaszczuk was forced to defend then-Child Safety minister, Shannon Fentiman - who is now Health minister - for attending the same festival amid criticism her department was failing kids by processing cases to slowly.

Opposition figures slammed Ms Fentiman at the time, saying she should have been spending the weekend working on the troubled department.

Ms Palaszczuk leapt to her defence saying she was granted permission for the trip.

'I have made it very clear to my cabinet ministers that I expect them to be fully briefed, across their issues for the estimates hearings and every single minister has given me that commitment and that assurance,' she said at the time.

But now it's Ms Palaszczuk who is likely to face a barrage of criticism for attending the glamorous music festival.

The Premier was recently raked over the coals for cancelling a cabinet meeting to party on a luxury yacht.

Ms Palaszczuk took several days off in August on the Quantum yacht for the Hamilton Island Race Week with her boyfriend Dr Reza Adib, and with celebrities.

The opposition Liberal National Party said her decision to cancel the Cabinet meeting was 'unfathomable', though Labor said the attack was 'puny and cheap'.

Since then, things have only got worse in the Sunshine State.

Figures released in May showed Queensland's healthcare system under severe pressure as ambulance ramping rates - when paramedics are unable to transfer the care of patients to a hospital emergency department - rose to the worst in Australia.

The statistics showed that service provision in hospitals across the state were severely delayed with patients having to wait 'dangerously' long periods before being attended to.

'Nearly one in two Queenslanders are ramped in their hour of need and the blame lies squarely with the chaotic Palaszczuk Government which is lurching from crisis to crisis,' LNP leader David Crisafulli said at the time.

In June, Ms Palaszczuk was spotted enjoying the long weekend in Sydney as Queensland grappled with a youth crime epidemic spiralling out of control.

The 53-year-old was seen wandering arm-in-arm with Dr Adib, 50, around Circular Quay, after a gruesome stabbing near Brisbane left a mother and daughter fighting for life and a teenage boy behind bars.

She was dressed in an all-black outfit accessorised with shoes and handbag to match her partner as the couple enjoyed the sights of Sydney Harbour.

By then it had been 12 months since Ms Palaszczuk earned the 'part-time Premier' title after Labor insiders divulged that she appeared more focused on glitzy red carpet events than leading the state.

Her trip to Sydney came after a 10-year-old girl issued a passionate plea for the Premier to take action on youth crime.

The little girl wrote a heartbreaking letter to Ms Palaszczuk after her dance school in Townsville, in the state's north, was burnt down - allegedly by youth offenders.

'Young criminals break into houses, steal cars and destroy lives every single night in this city - every single night - I'm telling you right now I'm not safe,' Samantha's letter, reported by the Today show, read.

'Children in Townsville are not safe, we are not safe in our own homes, even with doors locked they still find their way in.

'Please tell me what you are doing to make a difference, because right now I'm not looking forward to growing up, working hard to buy a house and a car, raise a family, when all of it can just be taken away in an instant by someone who ruins lives every single night.'

Queenslanders are also, like people across Australia, feeling deeply stressed by cost-of-living pressures.

A poll of 1,015 Queenslanders carried out in late March and early April asked them to identify the most important issues affecting them.

Cost-of-living ranked among the top two most important issues for 64 per cent, followed by housing affordability at 41 per cent and youth crime at 37 per cent.

Half of those polled said there were worse off than 12 months ago, and 17 per cent said they were 'getting close to (financial) breaking point'.

Shockingly, 8 per cent said they'd already fallen off the financial edge, in the poll carried out for the Courier-Mail.

When asked how safe they feel in their home, 15 per cent said they felt mostly unsafe or very unsafe.

The proportion of those feeling unsafe increased hugely to 22 per cent — more than one-in-five people — in regional Queensland.

A recent crime report from the Queensland Government Statistician's Office found that children made up nearly a fifth of the state's criminal numbers - the highest in 10 years.

Young people made up more than half of those charged with offences such as car theft and break-ins, the report found.

Amid a growing housing crisis, it was revealed last Tuesday that the Queensland government built just 485 social homes in the past financial year, which was labelled a 'disappointment' and 'absolutely insufficient' by social service groups.

Queensland Council of Social Service CEO, Aimee McVeigh, said it was nowhere near enough to keep up with demand.

'It's really disappointing to see in the face of a housing crisis we are not seeing an increase in the number of social houses built in this state,' she said.

'There are 300,000 Queenslanders with unmet housing needs and we know that the current level of investment, the current level of supply that's being delivered in Queensland is absolutely insufficient.'

The Splendour In The Grass festival is also not immune to the cost-of-living crisis, with ticket sales this year down massively to 35,000 from 50,000 last year.

Splendour co-producer Jessica Ducrou suggested it was a reflection of the 'current economy' and the cost-of-living crisis.

'We are seeing a lot of people buying single-day tickets rather than three days and that is very much a reflection on the budget,' she told the ABC.

Luxembourg and Spain have reported more than 100 new cases per 100,000 people in the past two weeks, the figures show, with Malta recording more than 80, Belgium more than 60, and France and the Netherlands more than 40. The UK has 20.7.

Spain reported on Monday a total of 1,833 new infections in the past 24 hours, bringing its seven-day total to 32,329. The daily figure provided by the health ministry was lower than Friday’s post-lockdown record of 2,987, but infection statistics in many European countries often dip on Mondays due to diagnosis and reporting delays on Sunday.

Four more Spanish regions imposed new laws intended to curb the spread of the virus, including closing nightclubs and obliging bars and restaurants to shut by 1am, joining two that began applying the measures – which also include limits on visits to retirement homes – on Sunday.

The northern Basque region on Monday declared a health emergency, allowing it to impose even tougher restrictions because of the risk of what authorities described as a “tsunami” of infections.

In total, 59,162 cases have been detected across Spain in the past two weeks, leading public health experts to warn the country is in a critical moment in its battle against the virus.

Last week nine scientific organisations published a joint letter warning that the recent surge in cases could risk a “collapse” of the country’s healthcare system. “If the situation continues and new measures are not adopted, there is a high probability that we will again face the situation seen during the state of alarm,” it noted.

Health officials have played down these fears, pointing to the fact that the majority of cases being detected are among people under 65 years old. As a result, they said, the number of deaths remained relatively low at 54 in the past week.

In Germany, which announced a comparatively low 561 new cases on Monday, the health minister said large gatherings and celebrations were the main source of new cases.

Weddings would be under threat if numbers continued to rise, Jens Spahn said, adding that while returning holidaymakers accounted for many new cases, domestic outbreaks were just as significant. Big parties could “spread the virus very, very fast”, he said.

In France, where Monday’s new infections figure was 493, also well down on the 3,000-plus reported on the two previous days, a government spokesman said riot police would be dispatched to Marseille, which along with the greater Paris area was this weekend classed as a Covid-19 “red zone” to ensure stricter rules on mask-wearing and social distancing were observed.

The Île-de-France region around the French capital also announced tougher measures in care homes, including mandatory tests for all new care home workers and residents as well as those returning from holiday.

The French public health agency described the situation as “preoccupying”, adding that “all indicators continue to progress and the transmission of the virus is accelerating”. It said all age groups were affected but most particularly young adults, and most infections were taking place outside of recognised clusters.

A historical theme park, the Puy du Fou, drew a storm of protest on social media after the local prefecture allowed it to organise an event attended by 9,000 people, far exceeding a government limit on gatherings of more than 5,000.

Opposition politicians and workers in France’s otherwise stricken arts sector said the park’s owner, a former conservative cabinet minister and friend of President Emmanuel Macron, had benefited from special favour. The culture minister, Roselyne Bachelot, denied this, saying the park had followed distancing requirements.

The Czech Republic, which has so far reported about 20,000 cases in total and 397 deaths, said face masks would be compulsory again from 1 September on public transport and in many indoor public venues because of a resurgence of infections.

The country was among the first in Europe to order people to wear masks in most public places in March, but lifted the requirement when infections fell.

“We consider this to be a preventative measure given that we are probably facing a complicated autumn, especially after 1 September when there will be high social interaction,” the health minister, Adam Vojtěch, said on Monday.";True;1;0.610566258430481;border_pos;0

Lindell, whose company is based in Minneapolis, made the announcement during an interview with conservative commentator Brian Glenn on Monday night.

'Just got off the phone with Bed Bath & Beyond. They’re dropping My Pillow. Just got off the phone not five minutes ago. Kohl’s, all these different places,' Lindell said during the interview. 'These [companies], they’re scared, like a Bed Bath & Beyond, they’re scared. They were good partners. In fact, I told them, ""You guys come back anytime you want.""'

Lindell later told Fox 9 Wayfair has also joined the MyPillow boycott amid public pressure he claims is being perpetrated by 'leftist groups'.

Further compounding the CEO's woes, earlier Monday Dominion Voting Systems sent Lindell a cease and desist letter, threatening 'imminently' sue him for defamation over his repeated baseless claims that their machines were 'rigged' to favor Biden over Trump in the 2020 election.

Citing Lindell to be a ‘prominent leader of the ongoing misinformation campaign’, the company wrote: ‘Despite knowing your implausible attacks against Dominion have no basis in reality, you have participated in the vast and concerted misinformation campaign to slander Dominion.'

Lindell has been ordered to cease and desist making defamatory claims against Dominion, and to ‘preserve and retain all documents relating to Dominion and your smear campaign against the company.’

Lindell later told Fox 9 Wayfair has also cut ties with MyPillow amid public pressure he claims is being perpetrated by 'leftist groups'.

In a follow-up letter later published by the company, they wrote: 'With this letter, Dominion renews its demand that you retract your defamatory accusations immediately and issue a public apology for damaging Dominion’s reputation with completely fabricated claims of fraud and corruption.

'Dominion has been forced to expend substantial monetary sums to protect the health and safety of its employees following innumerable death threats from the social media mob that your statements have agitated against Dominion. And your misrepresentations have required the company to incur substantial attorneys’ fees and to mitigate the damage you have inflicted upon Dominion’s reputation.'

In a statement to Axios responding to the letters, Lindell said: 'I want Dominion to put up their lawsuit because we have 100% evidence that China and other countries used their machines to steal the election.'

Trump and several of his allies have routinely pushed false conspiracy theories about the company since the election's conclusion, leading Dominion to take legal action.

Dominion has also sent letters to others, including Sidney Powell and Rudy Giuliani, both of whom are staunch Trump allies who have often pushed conspiracy theories about the integrity of the company’s voting machines.

Powell has been sued by Dominion for defamation, with the company seeking $1.3 billion in damages.

Dominion alleges that Powell acted ‘in concert with allies and media outlets determined to promote a false preconceived narrative about the 2020 election—caused unprecedented harm.

‘As a result of the defamatory falsehoods peddled by Powell ... Dominion’s founder, Dominion’s employees, Georgia’s governor, and Georgia’s secretary of state have been harassed and have received death threats, and Dominion has suffered enormous harm,’ the suit filed January 8th reads.

Separately, a Dominion employee has sued President Trump himself, in addition to the right-wing news platforms OANN and Newsmax, insisting their unfounded claims of election fraud have resulted in poll workers receiving death threats.

Lindell, meanwhile, met with Trump briefly at the White House on Friday and was caught by photographers holding notes which reference martial law and Sidney Powell.

The CEO later confirmed to CNN that he had met with the outgoing president for around five minutes, and said he had tried to hand him what he described as ‘evidence’ of voter fraud.

When pressed on what the apparent evidence pertained to show, Lindell failed to substantiate any of his claims and instead just regurgitated the same baseless conspiracy theories spouted by Trump since the 2020 election concluded.

Trump appeared ‘disinterested’ in his notes, officials said, with the president quickly dismissing him and sending him to the White House Counsel’s office.

When asked by CNN whether he believes Democrat Joe Biden won the presidential election, Lindell – a former crack addict turned pillow extraordinaire - said no.

‘No, he didn’t win the election, because I’ve seen it,’ Lindell responded.

Apparently undeterred by Trump’s rejection late last week, Lindell said Friday it’s his ‘hope’ that the president stages a military coup to stop Biden taking over the reins of power.

At least 25,000 National Guardsmen have been deployed to secure the Capitol for Inauguration Day on January 20, as the government braces for further unrest and protests in the wake of the January 6 riot.

'I don’t understand it. There’s like three people and every other person is a military guy,' Lindell told Right Side Broadcasting on the heightened security, which includes troops, non-scalable fences, and barricades.

'If it is all theatrics...I don't know. We've all had our prayers going ""Gee maybe somethings gonna be done that this president is willing to say hey we’ve been attacked by another country cause we have. Our country’s been under attack for a long time,""' he said.

He hinted that Trump could use the military presence for his own advantage, but the National Guard was brought in for the safety of the Inauguration.

In the interview he also spoke about his meeting with Trump where he presented what he claims to be new evidence pointing to a stolen election.

'You know I’ve been looking down every hole for election fraud since November 4th and about eight or nine days ago this proof came out. 100 percent footprints from the machines of the machine fraud,' Lindell said in the interview.

'I wanted to get it to the president. This is it. This shows that Joe Biden lost: 79 million for Donald Trump and 68 million for Joe Biden.’";True;1;0.5395301580429077;border_pos;0
https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-12920473/Donald-Trump-appeals-case-Maine-ballot.html?ns_mchannel=rssns_campaign=1490ito=1490;Donald Trump APPEALS case after Maine tries to dump him from the ballot;"Attorneys for Donald Trump have appealed a decision by Maine's secretary of state after disqualifying him from the primary ballot, citing the 14th Amendment's ban on anyone who engaged in insurrection from holding office.

The appeal was made to the Kennebec Superior Court following the decision by Maine's secretary of state, Shenna Bellows, just five days ago. The court must decide by January 17 and from there, it could potentially go to Maine Supreme Judicial Court and then up to the Supreme Court.

State law requires the Superior Court to decide the issue by Jan. 17, according to Bellows. From there, the case could go to Maine’s top court and the U.S. Supreme Court.

A similar conclusion was made on December 19 by Colorado's Supreme Court. Trump is expected to appeal that decision to the U.S. Supreme Court.

Last week, the Republican Party in Colorado appealed against their Supreme Court's decision, meaning that he is back on the ballot until an expected U.S. Supreme Court ruling.

Bellows, a Democrat, concluded that Trump, the frontrunner for the Republican nomination in 2024, incited an insurrection when he spread false claims about voter fraud in the 2020 election and then urged his supporters to march on the Capitol to stop lawmakers from certifying the vote.

Bellows suspended her decision until the state Supreme Court ruled on the matter.

Shenna Bellows, Maine's secretary of state, on Thursday ruled that Donald Trump should be disqualified from their March primary ballot

The decision came after a group of former Maine lawmakers said that Trump should be disqualified based on Section 3 of the 14th Amendment - a provision of the U.S. Constitution that bars people from holding office if they engaged in 'insurrection or rebellion' after previously swearing an oath to the United States.

The ruling, which can be appealed to a state court, applies only to the March primary election, but it could affect Trump's status for the November general election.

It likely will add to pressure on the U.S. Supreme Court to resolve questions about Trump's eligibility nationwide under the constitutional provision.

Trump has been indicted in both a federal case and in Georgia for his role in trying to overturn the 2020 election but he has not been charged with insurrection related to the Jan. 6 attack.

He leads opinion polls by a large margin in the race for the Republican nomination in 2024.

The Colorado Republican Party on Wednesday asked the U.S. Supreme Court to look at the lower court's ruling that disqualified Trump from running on the presidential ballot in the state due to his role in the January 6 Capitol riot.

Jena Griswold, Colorado's secretary of state, announced on Thursday that Trump will for the time being remain on the ballot, which goes to print on January 5 – unless the Supreme Court affirms the lower court's ruling or otherwise declines to take on the appeal.

The 4-3 ruling on December 19 said Trump would not appear on the state's primary ballot, according to a 155-year-old 14th Amendment clause that bans those from office who 'engaged in insurrection.'

Although Colorado's 10 Electoral College votes are unlikely to go to the Republican candidate anyway in the general election – and the state isn't highly important in the GOP primary – the ruling could set precedent for a slew of other states looking to remove Trump from the ballot.

Donald Trump will remain on the presidential primary ballot in Colorado for the time being as the GOP appeal puts Colorado's ruling on pause that disqualified the former president from running due to engagement in 'insurrection'

Colorado Secretary of State Jena Griswold (pictured on July 8, 2022) announced that Trump will remain on the ballot, but voiced her backing of her state's Supreme Court ruling, saying: 'The Colorado Supreme Court got it right... I urge the U.S. Supreme Court to act quickly given the upcoming presidential primary election'

The Michigan Supreme Court, however, already ruled after Colorado to leave the ex-president on the ballot for the state's primary – and the midwest swing state is much more important to clinching the White House in 2024.

Louisiana became the latest state to see a lawsuit filed attempting to keep Trump off the ballot related to the January 6 , 2021 Capitol riot.

'Donald Trump engaged in insurrection and was disqualified under the Constitution from the Colorado Ballot,' Griswold said in a press release.

'The Colorado Supreme Court got it right. This decision is now being appealed,' she continued.

'I urge the U.S. Supreme Court to act quickly given the upcoming presidential primary election.'

The Colorado Supreme Court put a stay – or pause – on its ruling until January 4 to allow time for the appeal process.

Former Trump attorney Jay Sekulow (pictured, left) filed a petition for Colorado's Republican Party appealing to the U.S. Supreme Court the Colorado state Supreme Court's 4-3 ruling to keep Donald Trump off the 2024 ballot

Former Trump attorney Jay Sekulow's conservative American Center for Law & Justice filed a petition Wednesday that would overturn Colorado's controversial decision.

'We've been saying from the day we took this case that this was one that would end up at the U.S. Supreme Court,' Seklow wrote in a statement on the filing, along with his son Jordan.

'Today, we just filed a petition for certiorari to the U.S. Supreme Court to overturn the Colorado Supreme Court's dangerously flawed twisting of the 14th Amendment to ban President Trump from the ballot,' wrote the father-son duo, who are representing Colorado's GOP.

'This is the most important case we have ever taken on,' they added. 'Because if we lose our right to vote, we lose our constitutional republic.'

'We expect this case to move very quickly, and we will keep you updated on its progress.'

The first impact of the appeal is to extend the stay of the 4-3 ruling from Colorado's highest court.

This puts the decision on pause until January 4 – the day before the state's primary ballots are due at the printer – or until an appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court is finished, whichever comes first.

Trump says he also still plans to appeal the ruling to the nation's highest court.

The Supreme Court has never ruled on Section 3 of the 14th Amendment, which was added after the Civil War to prevent former Confederates from returning to government.

The clause states that anyone who swore an oath to 'support' the constitution and then 'engaged in insurrection' against it cannot hold government office – but the section specifically mentions several offices without directly naming the presidency.

The Colorado high court ruled that applies to Trump after he encouraged his supporters to engage in the January 6, 2021 attack on the U.S. Capitol.

Rioters intended to stop the certification of President Joe Biden's victory in the 2020 presidential election when they descended on Washington, D.C.

Colorado's majority opinion is the first time in history that the 14th Amendment provision was used to block a presidential contender's campaign.

Four justices appointed by Democratic governors, Justices, Richard L. Gabriel, Melissa Hart, William W. Hood III and Monica Márquez, all circled, voted to disqualify the former president from Colorado's presidential primary ballot

'The Colorado Supreme Court has removed the leading Republican candidate from the primary and general ballots, fundamentally changing the course of American democracy,' the Colorado Republican Party's attorneys wrote.

The filing was posted on the website of a group run by Jay Sekulow, a former attorney for Trump representing the Colorado Republican Party who announced he was filing the appeal Wednesday.

Colorado Republican Party chairman Dave Williams confirmed the appeal was filed Wednesday.

The attorneys added: 'Unless the Colorado Supreme Court's decision is overturned, any voter will have the power to sue to disqualify any political candidate, in Colorado or in any other jurisdiction that follows its lead.'

'This will not only distort the 2024 presidential election but will also mire courts henceforth in political controversies over nebulous accusations of insurrection.'

The U.S. Supreme Court is expected to take the case, either after the Colorado GOP's appeal or Trump's own appeal.

If Trump ends up off the ballot in Colorado, it would have minimal effect on his campaign because he doesn't need the state, which he lost by 13 percentage points in 2020, to win the Electoral College in the presidential election. But it could open the door to courts or election officials striking him from the ballot in other must-win states.

Sean Grimsley, an attorney for the plaintiffs seeking to disqualify Trump in Colorado, said on a legal podcast last week that he hopes the nation's highest court hurries once it accepts the case, as he expects it will.

'We obviously are going to ask for an extremely accelerated timeline because of all the reasons I've stated, we have a primary coming up on Super Tuesday and we need to know the answer,' Grimsley said.

More than a dozen states, including Colorado, are scheduled to hold primaries March 5 on what is known as Super Tuesday – the largest single-day primary election contest.

The Colorado Supreme Court claims Trump engaged in an insurrection and therefore under clause 3 of the 14th Amendment is disqualified from running for office – but Republicans argue the ex-president has never been charged with insurrection. Pictured: Trump supporters stormed the Capitol Building on January 6, 2021 to block Congress certifying Joe Biden's 2020 election win

The Colorado case was considered the one with the greatest chance of success because it was filed by a Washington D.C.-based liberal group with ample legal resources – and all seven of the Colorado high court justices were appointed by Democrats.

Still, three of those Democrat-appointed justices were against the decision.

The unprecedented constitutional questions in the case haven't split on neatly partisan lines, with several prominent conservative legal theorists among the most vocal advocates of disqualifying Trump under Section 3.

Additionally, the half-dozen plaintiffs in the Colorado case are all Republican or unaffiliated voters.

Trump has been scathing on his Truth Social account and at his rallies about the cases, calling them 'election interference.'

He continued that on Wednesday, as he cheered a ruling earlier that day by the Michigan Supreme Court leaving him on the ballot, at least for the primary, in that state.

The undergraduates self-isolating for a fortnight at Manchester Metropolitan University (MMU) have been told they cannot leave the campus to visit the local testing centre, leading to fears the outbreak will spread.

The Manchester outbreak is just one of at least 36 at universities across Britain.

Labour education spokesman Kate Green last night called on ministers to stop students from returning to university for the start of the academic year – affecting 2.3 million in the UK.

She said they should either delay the start of term or 'pause' the return of students to university campuses where courses had not started.

Pressure to refund tuition By Emine Sinmaz and Daniel Martin for The Daily Mail Pressure is mounting on universities to refund tuition fees as thousands of students face lockdowns, online-only courses and the prospect of Christmas confined to their halls. Tory MPs said it was 'madness' that the country's universities were charging the same fees for 'second-rate' learning. As students face the prospect of being confined to their halls of residence over Christmas because of Covid-19 outbreaks on campuses, 3,000 students have already been locked down in their rooms after cases at 36 universities, including Glasgow, Manchester Metropolitan and Edinburgh Napier. Last night Robert Halfon, the Conservative chairman of the education select committee, said students must be compensated for the lack of face-to-face learning. The Department for Education said students who wanted refunds should appeal to their universities. Mr Halfon told the Daily Mail: 'If we have 3,000 students in lockdown now, it could be 6,000 next week, so ministers need to come up with a plan on testing and tracing. 'And we need to ensure students are back by Christmas, because a lockdown over Christmas would cause anguish for them and their families. 'The Government needs to seriously consider a discount, because when you pay for a product you should expect to get that product, and if not, you should get some money returned.' Tory MP George Freeman said yesterday it was 'madness' that students were locked in halls of residences by universities 'still happily taking their money'. He said on Twitter: 'How do I think universities make up the losses from offering student discounts? Well, not from fleecing students! Maybe from vice-chancellors' £300,000 salaries?' Advertisement

But outgoing University of Buckingham vice-chancellor Sir Anthony Seldon said: 'We must have a sense of perspective. Universities have gone to huge lengths to plan for this and many are coping.'

And the Department for Education rejected Labour's call, insisting it was 'working closely with universities to support them to keep staff and students as safe as possible'.

The 1,700 MMU students in lockdown yesterday complained of feeling abandoned – with some already plotting their escape.

After 127 positive tests for Covid-19 on Friday, the shocked students – many of them freshers living away from home for the first time – were ordered to self-isolate in their halls of residence for a fortnight.

Desperate undergraduates said supplies of food and toiletries were low and complained of students holding all-night parties likened to 'prison riots'.

Some tried to ease the boredom by putting up signs in their windows with slogans including 'send drink' and 'f*** Boris'.

As some students in lockdown likened the university to a prison by labelling it 'HMP MMU', with security guards blocking them from leaving, legal experts claimed their incarceration could amount to false imprisonment.

Adam Wagner, a human rights barrister at Doughty Street chambers in London, wrote on Twitter: 'False imprisonment is detention without lawful authority.'

Hours later, university vice-chancellor Professor Malcolm Press conceded it could only 'expect' students to follow the self-isolation rules – designed to avoid spreading the infection to their home towns.

While many students pledged to stick it out, others were preparing to flee the city.

Tilly Thompson, 19, said she felt like a 'caged animal' and was waiting for her mother to take her home to Wolverhampton.

Students claimed some of those under restrictions had been ignoring the rules and throwing parties. One boasted the quarantine would be 'a two-week p***-up', saying he had '200 cans of lager' and 'it's going to get messy'.

A student called Tom told BBC Radio 5 Live that people had been running past their flats shouting: 'Open your doors, we've got coronavirus, we want to give it to you.' He added: 'It was insane... parties going on everywhere, loud music... It was like a prison riot.'

Martyn Moss, of the University and College Union, said he had warned MMU chiefs that their plans for the 'mass return of students would inevitably see institutions become Covid incubators'.

He added: 'Universities should have spent the summer following the science and preparing properly for this inevitable crisis.'";True;1;0.7686752080917358;border_pos;0

He was responding to the conspiracy theories sparked by reports from the New York Times' Maggie Haberman and the National Review earlier this month that Trump is telling aides he could be back in the Oval Office by August.

A Morning Consult/POLITICO poll from earlier this month showed 29 percent of Republican voters believe Trump would be returned to the Oval Office at some point this year.

Michigan Democratic Rep. Elissa Slotkin asked Cohen how his department was handling the spread of disinformation, conspiracy theories, and the way they can spark violence, according to Politico.

Cohen insisted that he was not aware of any specific threats based on the Trump theory, but his staff were still watching online activity.

The briefing on domestic terrorism also covered the surge in violent crime in 2020 and 2021, following President Biden's announcement of a crackdown on gun dealers on Wednesday.

'Crack their skulls!': Trump told military to shoot and 'beat the f**k' out of BLM protesters last summer - but Joint Chiefs Chair Milley refused, new book reveals

The top US general rejected then-President Donald Trump's push for the military to 'crack skulls' at civil rights protests across the nation in 2020.

Joint Chiefs Chairman Mark Milley seemed to be at odds and - at times - the lone dissenting voice against the former president wanting to respond with force to protests over the murder of George Floyd, a black man who died while in police custody in Minneapolis.

Passionate exchanges between Milley and Trump were included in Wall Street Journal reporter Michael Bender's new book 'Frankly, We Did Win This Election: The Inside Story of How Trump Lost,' of which CNN obtained excerpts.

It comes as Milley yesterday said recruits should be 'open-minded and be widely read' amid growing claims that the US military is becoming more 'woke'.

The military officer spoke out against growing criticism over teaching critical race theory in the military as he was grilled by Republican Congressmen.

While watching protests unfold in places like Seattle and Portland, Trump highlighted cops' physical exchanges with protestors and told his administration that's what he wanted to see, CNN reported.

'That's how you're supposed to handle these people,' Trump told his top law enforcement and military officials, Bender wrote, according to CNN. 'Crack their skulls!'

Joint Chiefs Chairman Mark Milley, at the June 17 Senate Appropriations Committee hearing on Capitol Hill in Washington, was reportedly at odds with Donald Trump when Trump was president

Trump also told his team that he wanted the military to go in and 'beat the f--k out' of civil rights protestors, Bender wrote, according to CNN.

CNN reported other examples of Trump telling the military to shoot protestors. At one point, a Trump senior advisor Stephen Miller compared the protests to third-world countries, which angered Milley, Bender wrote.

Milley, who commanded troops in Iraq and Afghanistan, said, 'Shut the f--k up, Stephen,' CNN reported from one of the excerpts.

Bender's book showed Milley was concerned that Trump was going to invoke the Insurrection Act, which allows the president to deploy the military in cases of rebellion or terrorist attack.";True;1;0.5616428852081299;border_pos;0

'The president wrote a very generous letter,' Biden said. 'Because it was private, I won't talk about it until I talk to him. But it was generous.'

Trump left a note on the Resolute Desk in the Oval Office, one of the rare traditions he followed in the peaceful transfer of power. Trump never invited Biden to the White House after the election nor did he attend Biden's inauguration.

Biden wore a face mask as he sat behind the Resolute Desk to sign the executive orders. The visual was a stark change to former President Trump, who rarely wore a covering.

'I thought there's no time to wait,' he said. 'There's no time to start like today.'

There was a large stack of folders on the desk and pictures of his family decorated the credenza behind him.

Biden signed three executive actions: one ordering a mask mandate on federal property, another providing 'support for under served communities' and the third was to rejoin the Paris climate accord. Trump removed the United States from the climate agreement and Biden vowed to restore America to the accord on the first day of his presidency.

'As we indicated we will sign a number of the executive orders over the next several days to a week and I'm going to start today. The crisis of Covid-19 along with the economic crisis, and the climate crisis, the executive actions that we are signing will help change the course of the crisis,' he said. Biden is expected to sign many more executive orders in the day to come.

Shortly after signing the orders, Biden swore in nearly 1,000 federal appointees and staff in a virtual ceremony in the State Dining Room at the White House. He spoke from behind a lectern, while the appointees appeared at the event via video streams set up on a series of television screens.

The 46th president said if any of his appointees treat a colleague with disrespect, he will fire them 'on the spot.' He said that mindset had been missing in President Donald Trump's White House.

And in another clear reference to Trump's administration, Biden's White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said in her first briefing that she will strive to bring truth and transparency.

Biden got to work soon after making a grand entrance into the White House, walking hand-in-hand with First Lady Jill Biden to their new home and saying: 'It feels like I'm going home.'

It wasn't quite the same as the typical public stretches of the historic Avenue past presidents have walked for photo-ops. Coronavirus and security kept away usual onlookers. But there were children interspersed along the brief stretch outside the Treasury and White House, along with press and aides.

He also greeted D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser along the way – in a city that lacks representation in Congress that was the subject of street clashes and protests over the summer, and was put on lockdown by his inauguration and the Capitol riots.

Following suit was Vice President Kamala Harris, who left her own limo and got greeted by family members outside.

She and First Gentleman Doug Emhoff walked along a similar stretch, joined by his children and other family members. The first female vice president held hands with grand niece Amala as she approached the building.

'Madam Vice President!' shouted reporters trying to secure a comment. She was asked how it feels. 'Walking to work,' she said at one point.

The efforts to court the press were an attempt to reset relations with the media – the medium through which most Americans would see the inauguration with visitors all but shut down.

Donald Trump regularly railed against what he called the 'fake news,' whom he called the 'enemy of the people' – even as he provided frequent access to reporters during the period before the elections.

Harris then held hands with Emhoff, saluted a military honor guard, and walked up the steps to the Old Executive Office building, where the vice president's office is located. The long steps to the building were lined with their own honor guard.

Earlier in the afternoon, Biden and Harris had their first show of unity as they participated in a wreath-laying ceremony at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier besides past presidents and first ladies from both parties - with the obvious exception of Donald Trump.

Standing behind Biden and Harris at Arlington National Cemetery were former presidents Barack Obama and first ladies Michelle; George W. Bush and Laura; and Bill Clinton and Hillary.

The message of cross-party unity could not have been clearer: three former presidents and first ladies coming together to salute the fallen.

After past inaugurations, the new president and vice-president have traditionally traveled to Arlington, but on Wednesday afternoon the unofficial club of former presidents joined to echo the theme of Joe Biden's inaugural address. The 96-year-old Jimmy Carter did not come to the inauguration over COVID-19 concerns but congratulated Biden in a message.

The scene of three former and one current commanders-in-chief mourning the fallen together underlined how Trump had made himself an outcast from America's smallest - and most exclusive - club.

He had railed against all three former presidents, especially Obama, but had also dismissed Bush, privately calling him a 'dummy,' while his one-time friendship with Bill Clinton was shattered by the bitterness of the 2016 election campaign.

Biden signed three executive actions: one ordering a mask mandate on federal property, another providing 'support for under served communities' and the third was to rejoin the Paris climate accord. Trump removed the United States from the climate agreement and Biden vowed to restore America to the accord on the first day of his presidency

'As we indicated we will sign a number of the executive orders over the next several days to a week and I'm going to start today. The crisis of Covid-19 along with the economic crisis, and the climate crisis, the executive actions that we are signing will help change the course of the crisis,' he said

The hostility was reciprocated: Members of the Bush family were critical of Trump throughout his administration. Four years ago at inauguration, George W. Bush commented 'That was some weird s**t.'

In contrast, while Obama was extremely critical of Bush when running for president in 2008, those two families have developed a friendly relationship, especially between Bush and Michelle Obama. Bill Clinton and George H.W. Bush became close friends after the 41st president's defeat.

In his inaugural address, Biden issued a call for unity and promised to govern for 'all Americans' Wednesday, seeking to move the nation beyond the presidency of Donald Trump and what he described as an attack on democracy itself in his first remarks to the nation as president.

In a 22-minute address after he was sworn in 11 minutes early by Chief Justice John Roberts, Biden drew a sharp contrast between his presidency and the preceding four years, saying: 'My whole soul is in this. I'll keep everything I do in your service, thinking not of power but of possibilities, not of personal injuries but the public good.'

Biden did not mention Trump by name but wove a thread of contrast through his speech. He denounced 'lies told for power and for profit,' said 'there are truth and there are lies,' acknowledged the bitter divisions in the country as an 'uncivil war,' and referred to the MAGA mob which rioted in the place he spoke just two weeks ago, saying: 'Democracy prevailed.'

He spoke in unique circumstances: no crowds because of COVID and a security clampdown in the wake of the MAGA riot, and for the first time since 1869, his predecessor absent.

Trump had left Washington D.C. with a tub-thumping speech saying 'we will be back – in some form' and taken Air Force One to Mar-a-Lago, issuing a final pardon with less than an hour of his presidency left, and telling his friends he will start his own 'Patriot Party.'

On the dais on the Capitol steps, Biden put his hand on his family's Bible, held by his wife Jill, and took the oath, then addressed the nation for the first time as the 46th president.

READ JOE BIDEN'S PROCLAMATION OF UNITY I am humbled before God and my fellow Americans to take the sacred oath of President of our beloved country. Today, we celebrate the triumph of democracy after an election that saw more Americans voting than ever before in our Nation's history, and where the will of the people has been heard and heeded. We do so at a moment of great peril and promise for our Nation. A once-in-a-century deadly pandemic. A historic and deepening economic crisis. Calls for racial justice some 400 years in the making. A climate crisis with force and fury. We also feel the rise in political extremism and domestic terrorism –- unleashed just days ago on our Capitol, the citadel of freedom, but brewing long before –- that we must confront and defeat. Yet in this dire moment, democracy prevailed. On this day, we set our sights on the Nation we know we can and must be. I am honored to do so alongside Vice President Kamala Harris, the first woman who has taken the oath to serve in elected national office, and who will not be the last. Together, we know that to overcome the challenges before all of us, to restore the soul of America, requires the beating heart of a democracy: Unity. With unity, we can save lives and beat this pandemic. We can build our economy back better and include everyone. We can right wrongs and root out systemic racism in our country. We can confront the climate crisis with American jobs and ingenuity. We can protect our democracy by seeing each other not as adversaries but as fellow Americans. For the world to see, with unity we can lead not just by the example of our power, but by the power of our example. As we start the hard work to be done, I pray this moment gives us the strength to rebuild this house of ours upon a rock that can never be washed away. And, as in the Prayer of St. Francis, for where there is discord, union; where there is doubt, faith, where there is darkness, light. On this Inauguration Day I swear an oath to be a President for all Americans and ask every American to join me in this cause of democracy. May this be the story that unites us as fellow Americans and as the United States of America. NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, by the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim January 20, 2021, a National Day of Unity and call upon the people of our Nation to join together and write the next story of our democracy –- an American story of decency and dignity, of love and of healing, and of greatness and of goodness. IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twentieth day of January, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-one, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-fifth.

He made unity the theme of his address and also highlighted the coronavirus hobbling the nation, taking a pause and asking for silent prayer for the more than 400,000 COVID dead.

'To all those who supported our campaign, I'm humbled by the faith you've placed in us. To all of those who did not support us, let me say this. Hear me out as we move forward. Take a measure of me and my heart,' said Biden.

'If you still disagree, so be it. That's democracy,' he told opponents. 'That's America. The right to dissent peaceably. Within the guardrails of our republic, it's perhaps this nation's greatest strength. Yet hear me clearly: disagreement must not lead to disunion. And I pledge this to you, I will be a president for all Americans – all Americans,' he said.

He spoke with urgency about the 'painful lesson' of recent weeks, referencing the riot in the Capitol that followed Trump's effort to overturn the results in states that voted for Biden as a historic time of testing for the nation – but also pronounced that 'democracy has prevailed.'

'We must end this uncivil war that pits red against blue,' he said, echoing some of the themes of Barack Obama, who brought him to the White House only to watch his own agenda come under assault during the Trump presidency.

He warned of a 'dark winter' and listed the challenges he faces, including COVID, an economy in crisis, and the explosion of the Black Lives Matter movement in the wake of the police killing of George Floyd saying: 'A once in a century virus that silently stalks the country. It's taken as many lives in one year as America lost in all of World War II. Millions of jobs have been lost, hundreds of thousands of businesses closed, a cry for racial justice some 400 years in the making moves us. The dream of justice for all will be deferred no longer.'

But he said: 'To overcome these challenges, to restore the soul and secure the future of America, requires so much more than words. It requires the most elusive of all things in a democracy, unity.'

And he spoke of his own faith as the second-ever Catholic president, quoting St. Augustine, after a day which began with mass with Congressional leaders, and also spoke of his faith in America, saying: 'This is a great nation. We are good people.'

The 78-year-old thanked his predecessors of both parties for being at his swearing-in. Former Presidents Barack Obama, Bill Clinton and George W. Bush attended – making Trump's absence even more notable.

Trump skipped the event, flying to Mar-a-Lago after organizing his own pep rally sendoff, telling supporters and family members 'Have a good life, we will see you soon.'

'I thank my predecessors of both parties for their presence here today. I thank them from the bottom of my heart,' Biden said, adding he had spoken to former President Jimmy Carter on the phone the night before. Carter did not attend out of safety reasons because of the COVID pandemic.

Biden also acknowledged the attack that took place on the Capitol two weeks ago, when a pro-Trump mob interrupted the certification of his victory.

'Now on this hallowed ground where just a few days ago violence sought to shake the capital's very foundation. We come together under one nation, under god, indivisible, to transfer the peaceful power as we have for two centuries,' he said.

Biden gave his inaugural remarks after history-making Vice President Kamala Harris was sworn in, with the oldest person to become president taking an oath to 'preserve, protect and defend' the Constitution – starting his tenure amid a pandemic and putting an end to a tumultuous four-year term by President Trump.

In his inaugural remarks, Biden declared: 'Unity is the path forward.

He asked for all Americans to come together and join him. He also asked those 75 million Trump voters to 'hear him out' during his time in office.

'My whole soul is in it today, on this January day, my whole soul is in this, bringing America together, uniting our people, uniting our nation. I ask every American to join me in this cause,' he said.

Biden didn't mention President Trump by name but his speech was full of denunciation of Trump's tactics and methods.

'We can see each other not as adversaries, but as neighbors. We can treat each other with dignity and respect. We can join forces, stop the shouting and lower the temperature,' he said.

Biden specifically called for an end to manipulating facts and raging at one another – two characteristics of Trump's time in office.

'Let's start afresh, all of us. Let's begin to listen to one another again, hear one another, see one another, show respect to one another. Politics doesn't have to be a raging fire, destroying everything in its path. Every disagreement doesn't have to be a cause for total war. And we must reject the culture in which facts themselves are manipulated and even manufactured,' he noted.

'There is truth and there are lies. Lies told for power and for profit. Each of us has the duty and responsibility as citizens, as Americans, and especially as leaders, leaders who have pledged to honor our constitution and protect our nation, to defend the truth and defeat the lies,' Biden said.

He acknowledged the deep divides and wounds in the country.

'This is a great nation. We are good people. Over the centuries, through storm and strife, and peace and at war, we've come so far. We still have far to go. We'll press forward with speed and urgency, for we have much to do in this winter of peril and significant possibilities. Much to repair, much to restore, much to heal, much to build, and much to gain,' he said.

Biden also acknowledged the coronavirus pandemic that has killed more than 400,000 Americans and devastated the American economy.

'We need all our strength to persevere through this dark winter. We're entering what may be the toughest and deadliest period of the virus. We must set aside politics and finally face this pandemic as one nation. One nation. I promise you this. As the bible says, we may endure for a night, but joy cometh in the morning. We will get through this together. Together!,' he said.

In his first act as president, he asked Americans to join him in a moment of silence to remember those who died from the deadly disease.

'My first act as president, I'd like to ask you to join me in a moment of silent prayer to remember all those who we lost this past year to the pandemic, those 400,000 fellow Americans, moms, dads, husband, wives, daughters, sons, coworkers. We will honor them by becoming the people and the nation we know we can and should be. Let's say a silent prayer for those who lost their lives and for those left behind and for our country. Amen,' he said.

He acknowledged the challenges that face him as he takes office as the nation's 46th president, including the pandemic, racism, the climate and America's role in the world.

'Folks, this is a time of testing. We face an attack on democracy and untruth, a raging virus, growing inequity, sting of systemic racism, a climate in crisis, America's role in the world. Any one of these would be enough to challenge us in profound ways, but the fact is, we face them all at once presenting this nation with one of the gravest responsibilities we've had. Now we're going to be tested. Are we going to step up, all of us? It's time for boldness, for there's so much to do,' he said.

He closed with another call for unity.

'My fellow Americans, I close the day where I began, with a sacred oath, before God and all of you. I give you my word, I will always level with you,' he said.

'Together we shall write an American story of hope, not fear, of unity, not division, of light, not darkness, a story of decency and dignity, love and healing, greatness and goodness. May this be the story that guides us, the story that inspires us, and the story that tells ages yet to come that we answer the call of history. We met the moment. Democracy and hope, truth and justice did not die on our watch, but thrived,' he added.

Biden concluded his 20 minutes of remarks with: 'So, with purpose and resolve, we turn to those tasks of our time, sustained by faith, driven by conviction, devoted to one another and the country we love with all our hearts. May god bless America and may God protect our troops. Thank you, America.'

Joe and Jill Biden greeted their predecessors in the White House with hugs and handshakes as they exited the inauguration platform. The couple shared a particularly long hug with Barack and Michelle Obama, who they were close to in the eight years Biden served as Obama's vice president.

They also greeted George W. Bush and Laura Bush and Bill and Hillary Clinton. The former first couples will join the Bidens at Arlington National Cemetery to lay a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier in a show of bipartisan unity.

He closed with another call for unity. 'My fellow Americans, I close the day where I began, with a sacred oath, before God and all of you. I give you my word, I will always level with you,' he said

READ JOE BIDEN'S FULL INAUGURAL ADDRESS Chief Justice Roberts, Vice President Harris, Speaker Pelosi, Leader Schumer, Leader McConnell, Vice President Pence, and my distinguished guests, my fellow Americans, this is America's day. This is democracy's day, a day of history and hope, of renewal and resolve. Through a crucible for the ages, America has been tested anew. And America has risen to the challenge. Today we celebrate the triumph, not of a candidate, but of a cause, the cause of democracy. The people, the will of the people, has been heard, and the will of the people has been heeded. We've learned again that democracy is precious. Democracy is fragile. And at this hour, my friends, democracy has prevailed. So now, on this hallowed ground, where just a few days ago violence sought to shake the Capitol's very foundation, we come together as one nation under God, indivisible, to carry out the peaceful transfer of power as we have for more than two centuries. As we look ahead in our uniquely American way, restless, bold, optimistic, and set our sights on the nation we know we can be and we must be. I thank my predecessors of both parties for their presence here today. I thank them from the bottom of my heart. And I know, and I know the resilience of our constitution and the strength, the strength of our nation, as does President Carter who I spoke with last night, who cannot be with us today, but whom we salute for his lifetime in service. I've just taken the sacred oath each of those patriots have taken. The oath first sworn by George Washington. But the American story depends not on any one of us, not on some of us, but on all of us, on we the people, who seek a more perfect union. This is a great nation. We are good people. And over the centuries, through storm and strife, in peace and in war, we've come so far, but we still have far to go. We'll press forward with speed and urgency, for we have much to do in this winter of peril and significant possibilities. Much to repair, much to restore, much to heal, much to build, and much to gain. Few people in our nation's history have been more challenged or found a time more challenging or difficult than the time we're in now. Once in a century virus that silently stalks the country. It's taken as many lives in one year as America lost in all of World War II. Millions of jobs have been lost, hundreds of thousands of businesses closed, a cry for racial justice some 400 years in the making moves us. The dream of justice for all will be deferred no longer. A cry for survival comes from planet itself. A cry that can't be any more desperate or any more clear, and now a rise of political extremism, white supremacy, domestic terrorism that we must confront and we will defeat. To overcome these challenges, to restore the soul and secure the future of America, requires so much more than words. It requires the most elusive of all things in a democracy, unity. Unity. In another January, on New Year's Day in 1863, Abraham Lincoln signed the emancipation proclamation. When he put pen to paper, the president said, and I quote, 'if my name ever goes down into history, it'll be for this act, and my whole soul is in it.' 'My whole soul is in it.' Today, on this January day, my whole soul is in this: bringing America together, uniting our people, uniting our nation. And I ask every American to join me in this cause. Uniting to fight the foes we face, anger, resentment and hatred, extremism, lawlessness, violence, disease, joblessness and hopelessness. With unity, we can do great things, important things. We can right wrongs. We can put people to work in good jobs. We can teach our children in safe schools. We can overcome the deadly virus. We can reward -- reward work and rebuild the middle class and make health care secure for all. We can deliver racial justice and we can make America once again the leading force for good in the world. I know speaking of unity can sound to some like a foolish fantasy these days. I know that the forces that divide us are deep and they are real. But I also know they are not new. Our history has been a constant struggle between the American ideal that we all are created equal, and the harsh ugly reality that racism, nativism, fear, demonization have long torn us apart. The battle is perennial, and victory is never assured. Through civil war, the great depression, World War, 9/11, through struggle, sacrifices, and setbacks, our better angels have always prevailed. In each of these moments, enough of us -- enough of us -- have come together to carry all of us forward, and we can do that now. History, faith, and reason show the way, the way of unity. We can see each other, not as adversaries, but as neighbors. We can treat each other with dignity and respect. We can join forces, stop the shouting, and lower the temperature. For without unity, there is no peace, only bitterness and fury. No progress, only exhausting outrage. No nation, only a state of chaos. This is our historic moment of crisis and challenge, and unity is the path forward. And we must meet this moment as the United States of America. If we do that, I guarantee you, we will not fail. We have never, ever, ever, ever failed in America when we've acted together. And so today, at this time, in this place, let's start afresh, all of us. Let's begin to listen to one another again. Hear one another. See one another. Show respect to one another. Politics doesn't have to be a raging fire, destroying everything in its path. Every disagreement doesn't have to be a cause for total war. And we must reject the culture in which facts themselves are manipulated, and even manufactured. My fellow Americans, we have to be different than this. America has to be better than this, and I believe America is so much better than this. Just look around. Here we stand, in the shadow of the Capitol dome, as it was mentioned earlier, completed amid the civil war, when the union itself was literally hanging in the balance. Yet, we endured. We prevailed. Here we stand, looking out on the great mall where Dr. King spoke of his dream. Here we stand where, 108 years ago at another inaugural, thousands of protesters tried to block brave women marching for the right to vote. And today, we mark the swearing of the first woman in American history elected to national office, Vice President Kamala Harris. Don't tell me things can't change! Here we stand, across the Potomac, from Arlington Cemetery, where heroes who gave the last full measure of devotion, rest in eternal peace. And here we stand, just days after a riotous mob thought they could use violence to silence the will of the people, to stop the work of our democracy, to drive us from this sacred ground. It did not happen. It will never happen. Not today. Not tomorrow. Not ever. Not ever. To all those who supported our campaign, I'm humbled by the faith you've placed in us. To all of those who did not support us, let me say this. Hear me out as we move forward. Take a measure of me and my heart. If you still disagree, so be it. That's democracy. That's America. The right to dissent peaceably. Within the guardrails of our republic, it's perhaps this nation's greatest strength. Yet hear me clearly, disagreement must not lead to disunion. And I pledge this to you, I will be a president for all Americans, all Americans. And I promise you, I will fight as hard for those who did not support me as for those who did. Many centuries ago, St. Augustine, a saint in my church, wrote that a people was a multitude defined by the common objects of their love. Defined by the common objects of their love. What are the common objects we as Americans love, that define us as Americans? I think we know. Opportunity, security, liberty, dignity, respect, honor and, yes, the truth. The recent weeks and months have taught us a painful lesson. There is truth and there are lies, lies told for power and for profit. And each of us has a duty and a responsibility as citizens, as Americans, and especially as leaders, leaders who have pledged to honor our Constitution and protect our nation, to defend the truth and defeat the lies. Look, I understand that many of my fellow Americans view the future with fear and trepidation. I understand they worry about their jobs. I understand like my dad, they lay in bed wondering, can I keep my health care, can I pay my mortgage. Thinking about their families, about what comes next. I promise you, I get it. But the answer is not to turn inward, to retreat into competing factions, distrusting those who don't look like -- look like you or worship the way you do or don't get their news from the same source as you do. We must end this uncivil war that pits red against blue, rural versus -- rural versus urban, conservative versus liberal. We can do this if we open our souls instead of hardening our hearts. If we show a little tolerance and humility, and if we are willing to stand in the other person's shoes -- as my mom would say -- just for a moment, stand in their shoes. Because here's the thing about life: there's no accounting for what fate will deal you. Some days, when you need a hand. There are other days when we're called to lend a hand. That's how it has to be. That's what we do for one another. And if we are this way, our country will be stronger, more prosperous, more ready for the future. And we can still disagree. My fellow Americans, in the work ahead of us, we're going to need each other. We need all our strength to preserve -- to persevere through this dark winter. We're entering what may be the toughest and deadliest period of the virus. We must set aside politics and finally face this pandemic as one nation, one nation. And I promise you this. As the Bible says, 'weep, ye may endure for a night, but joy cometh in the morning.' We will get through this together. Together. Look, folks, all my colleagues that I served with in the house and the senate up here, we all understand, the world is watching, watching all of us today. So here's my message to those beyond our borders. America has been tested, and we've come out stronger for it. We will repair our alliances and engage with the world once again. Not to meet yesterday's challenges, but today's and tomorrow's challenges. And we'll lead not merely by the example of our power, but by the power of our example. We'll be a strong and trusted partner for peace, progress, and security. Look, you all know, we've been through so much in this nation. In my first act as president, I'd like to ask you to join me in a moment of silent prayer to remember all those who we lost in this past year to the pandemic, those 400,000 fellow Americans -- moms, dads, husbands, wives, sons, daughters, friends, neighbors, and co-workers. We'll honor them by becoming the people and the nation we know we can and should be. So, I ask you, let's say a silent prayer for those who have lost their lives and those left behind and for our country. Amen. Folks, this is a time of testing. We face an attack on our democracy and on truth. A raging virus, growing inequity, the sting of systemic racism, a climate in crisis. America's role in the world. Any one of these would be enough to challenge us in profound ways. But the fact is, we face them all at once. Presenting this nation with one of the gravest responsibilities we've had. Now we're going to be tested. Are we going to step up, all of us? It's time for boldness, for there is so much to do. And this is certain. I promise you, we will be judged, you and I, by how we resolve these cascading crises of our era. We will rise to the occasion, is the question. Will we master this rare and difficult hour? Will we meet our obligations, and pass along a new and better world to our children? I believe we must. I'm sure you do as well. I believe we will. And when we do, we'll write the next great chapter in the history of the United States of America, the American story, a story that might sound something like a song that means a lot to me. It's called 'American Anthem.' And there's one verse that stands out, at least for me. And it goes like this: 'The work and prayers of centuries have brought us to this day. What shall be our legacy? What will our children say? Let me know in my heart when my days are through. America, America, I gave my best to you.' Let's add. Let's, us, add our own work and prayers to the unfolding story of our great nation. If we do this, then when our days are through, our children and our children's children will say of us, they gave their best, they did their duty, they healed a broken land. My fellow Americans, I close the day where I began, with a sacred oath before God and all of you. I give you my word, I will always level with you. I will defend the Constitution. I'll defend our democracy. I'll defend America. And I'll give all, all of you, keep everything you -- I do in your service, thinking not of power but of possibilities, not of personal injuries but the public good. And together we shall write an American story of hope, not fear. Of unity, not division. Of light, not darkness. A story of decency and dignity, love and healing, greatness and goodness. May this be the story that guides us, the story that inspires us, and the story that tells ages yet to come that we answered the call of history, we met the moment. Democracy and hope, truth and justice, did not die on our watch, but thrived, that America secured liberty at home and stood once again as a beacon to the world. That is what we owe our forebears, one another, and generations to follow. So, with purpose and resolve, we turn to those tasked of our time, sustained by faith, driven by conviction, and devoted to one another and the country we love with all our hearts. May God bless America and may God protect our troops. Thank you, America. Advertisement

Biden also exchanged salutes with General Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. A military honor guard saluted the new president as he departed as 'Stars & Stripes' played.

The Bidens held hands as they walked through the Capitol building after the ceremony

Biden had cued up a batch of executives for signing late Wednesday afternoon to begin the effort to roll back elements of the Trump agenda and demonstrate a restoration to the last Democratic administration.

Biden was planning to sign orders to stop construction of Trump's border wall, end the ban on immigration from majority Muslim nations, and reenter the Paris climate accord.

Others would get the U.S. back into the World Health Organization, require mask use in federal buildings, and end a 1776 commission conceived as a way to push back against 'woke' efforts to take down confederate statues and otherwise reexamine the nation's monuments and memory.

Biden, 78 and the oldest person sworn in as president, inherits a divided country, wracked by the virus, with millions on unemployment, and huge swaths of Republicans doubting the legitimacy of his election.

Biden was joined on the West Front of the Capitol by predecessors and lawmakers from both parties – including now-former Vice President Mike Pence, who had overseen the counting of Biden's 306 to 232 electoral vote win in a normally perfunctory count that was interrupted by the riot.

Biden made the coronavirus pandemic a central part of his campaign, and there were reminders all around him of the difficult circumstances the nation faces. Attendees had their chairs spaced out in an effort at social distancing. Biden, First Lady Jill Biden, and other guests wore masks in an effort to limit the spread of the virus that has killed 400,000 Americans.

Just as evident was the constitutional crisis the nation faced, with figures from both parties present as a show of unity and continuity. Former President Barack Obama, who put Biden on the ticket, was there with former first lady Michelle Obama, who made impassioned pleas for Biden's election.

Trump's contempt for Obama and birther claims helped fuel the president's rise. Also there was former President George W. Bush and former first lady Laura Bush. Bush had been astonished by some of Trump's rhetoric at Trump's inaugural address four years ago, and his own dynasty fell victim to Trump's political attacks on his brother, Jeb.

During the day's events, a series of speakers pointed to the Capitol riot, praising the peaceful transition in a capitol locked down by 25,000 National Guard forces brought in to maintain security.

'This is the day when our democracy picks itself up, brushes off the dust, and does what it always does,' said Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), one of a bevy of Democrats Biden defeated in his road to the White House.

Republican Sen. Roy Blunt of Missouri noted that there was 'one political party more pleased today' just as 'on every inaugural day' – than the other.

Biden had lined up other gestures to demonstrate unity of purpose – and his own firm control of the government after Trump spent months calling the election 'rigged' and claiming he had won.

After attending mass with Republican and Democratic leaders, Biden planned to lay a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknowns at Arlington National Cemetery. He was to be accompanied by predecessors Obama, Bush, and Clinton.

His return to the White House would also reestablish norms. After Trump has been out of sight for days, releasing canned video farewell remarks, Biden was to allow reporters into the Oval Office when he signed orders.

His new White House press secretary, Jen Psaki, was to hold an on-camera briefing Wednesday night.

Earlier that morning, Biden orchestrated a demonstration of faith and political power before he took the oath of office – attending mass with congressional leaders from both parties.

Biden and the powerbrokers who will help steer or stall his agenda joined for the service at the Cathedral of St. Matthew the Apostle, where funeral services were held for President John F. Kenned in 1963.

They met in a city under heavy military guard amid security threats following the MAGA riots January 6.

He was joined by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, who said Tuesday that President Trump 'provoked' the crowd that ransacked the Capitol and has not said how he will vote on impeachment. Also joining was House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, who reportedly infuriated Trump with his remarks on the floor of the House where he blasted Trump's conduct but still voted not to impeach him.

McCarthy was one of the more than 100 House Republicans who voted to impeach Trump. 'The president bears responsibility for Wednesday's attack by mob rioters,' Mr. McCarthy said on the House floor Wednesday. 'What we saw last week was not the American way. Neither is the continued rhetoric that Joe Biden is not the legitimate president.'

He was also joined by Harris, her husband Doug Emhoff and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who said Trump may have been an accessory to murder through his actions connected to the MAGA riot at the Capitol, and soon-to-be Senate Majority Leader Charles Schumer, who will oversee Trump's impeachment after he leaves.

His visit came just minutes after President Donald Trump departed the White House and stepped aboard Marine One for the last time – without engaging in any of the brash 'chopper talk' with the press that had become his trademark. Instead, the president flew to a staged rally on a military base where Ivanka Trump, son-in-law Jared Kushner other family members and other remaining supporters gathered. Laura Branigan's 'Gloria' was playing when Trump landed.

Biden will be the nation's second Catholic president. The cathedral is just blocks away from the White House – although getting there would require circumventing a massive security presence with fencing and members of the 25,000 strong National Guard force protecting the city.

The demonstration of unity – a prelude to what was set to occur at the West Front of the Capitol – separated the powerful lawmakers who remain from President Trump, who set up his own separate departure while skipping many of the traditional gestures of continuity. Trump didn't host Biden at the the White House; the first lady didn't host Dr. Jill Biden; Trump skipped the inauguration altogether and left Washington before Biden was to take office.

Biden and his wife, Dr. Jill Biden, departed Blair House across the street from the White House just after Trump wrapped up remarks to his family and supporters at Joint Base Andrews, telling them: 'Have a good life, we will see you soon.'

The Bidens traveled by motorcade to St. Matthews. He has regularly attended mass during the campaign and during the transition.

Biden wore a mask – as he seeks to mobilize Americans to mask-up for 100 days to try to stem the spread of infection.

Biden's act of ritual and supplication came after the Bidens and President-elect Kamala Harris and her husband Doug Emhoff on Tuesday attended a memorial to the 400,000 victims of the coronavirus at the Lincoln Memorial.

In the split-screen coverage of the transition brought on by Trump's failure to linger, while the Bidens were gathered inside the cathedral for mass, Air Force One took off with Trump's rally soundtrack playing Frank Sinatra's 'My Way.'

Donald Trump vowed 'we will be back - in some form' as he left Washington D.C. for the last time Wednesday, flying off on Air Force One to Mar-a-Lago to snub Joe Biden – then claiming credit in advance for the new administration's success.

'Have a good life,' he told a crowd of a few hundred supporters at Joint Base Andrews, after listing his 'achievements' in a speech which began after a 21-gun salute.

In the front row, Ivanka Trump cried, while behind the maskless crowd chanted 'thank you Trump,' before the first family climbed the stairs to Air Force One for the final time.

The military ceremony had the atmosphere of a Trump rally: Gloria was played as Air Force One taxied, and then the YMCA as Trump hugged and kissed his children.

'We love you. We will be back in some form,' he told the crowd of cheering supporters before signing off: 'Have a good life, we will see you soon.'

The farewell resembled one of Trump's infamous campaign rallies, ending with 'YMCA' – the song Trump would depart to – as supporters cheered 'USA, USA, USA.'

The president paused at times in his remarks. While he did not show tears, he appeared to feel the weight of the occasion while taking time to enjoy the final moments of his time in office. He notably did not mention the name of incoming President Joe Biden.

'Hail to Chief' played as Trump and Melania - who was wearing a Chanel jacket, sunglasses and carrying a $60,000 black crocodile Hermes Birkin bag - walked from Marine One to the platform where the president addressed the crowd.

'We love you,' the supporters yelled as Trump took the stage after arriving while his children watched on proudly.

'We accomplished a lot,' Trump said. 'We worked hard. We left it all - as the athletes would say - we left it in the field.'

Donald Trump left the White House on Marine One for the final time Wednesday, pumping his fist and giving a thumbs-up as he walked with Melania to the start of a new life.

The only people gathered outside to wish him goodbye were the press, to whom he briefly spoke to them before getting on board.

In a glaring split-screen moment defining the end of the Trump years, Joe Biden was about to leave Blair House, the White House's official guest house, to go to mass with his wife Jill and Congressional leaders.

Trump was flying to Joint Base Andrews to speak in front of Air Force One to a small crowd of supporters.

The pair stopped briefly to speak to the media before they boarded the helicopter with a stream of staffers hurrying behind them. Melania was dressed in all black and wore sunglasses.

Trump's early departure for Florida has caused a logistical and security nightmare since he is taking with him the nuclear codes. They will then be flown back to DC to be handed over to Biden this afternoon.

On Tuesday night, Trump made one of his final acts in office granting pardons to dozens of rappers, millionaires and strategists, including his old friend Steve Bannon.

As he makes his way to Florida on Wednesday morning, Biden will begin his day by attending mass with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. He will then watch stars including Jennifer Lopez and Lady Gaga serenade him on the Captiol before delivering his address to the nation and being sworn in.

This year, due to the ongoing pandemic and fears of a security threat, the mall - where thousands normally line up to greet the new President and First Lady - will be closed to the public.

A smaller-than-usual crowd of guests including former Presidents and lawmakers will attend the inauguration ceremony in a socially-distanced manner instead.

Trump PARDONS Steve Bannon: President grants clemency to 143 people including White House strategist who 'defrauded MAGA fans out of $25M', Lil Wayne, Kodak Black and convicted politicians

Donald Trump has granted clemency to Steve Bannon as part of a wave of 143 pardons and commutations announced early Wednesday morning during the president's final hours in office.

Bannon, 67, helped Trump win the election in 2016 and was a senior White House adviser. In August last year he pleaded not guilty to charges that he defrauded MAGA donors to 'We Build the Wall,' an online campaign that raised $25 million.

Pardoning Bannon in a list that dropped shortly after midnight the White House said: 'President Trump granted a full pardon to Stephen Bannon. Prosecutors pursued Mr. Bannon with charges related to fraud stemming from his involvement in a political project.

Donald Trump has pardoned Steve Bannon. The former White House Chief Strategist, center, exits the Manhattan Federal Court on August 20 last year after he was accused of defrauding donors in a $25 million border wall fundraising campaign

'Mr. Bannon has been an important leader in the conservative movement and is known for his political acumen.'

The top names on Trump's pardon list STEVE BANNON - Former Trump strategist who was charged with swindling the president's supporters in a fundraising bid for the infamous Mexico border wall LIL WAYNE - Rapper who had voiced support for Trump and faced up to 10 years in prison for illegally possessing a .45 caliber handgun KODAK BLACK - Rapper who was serving a nearly four-year prison term for making a false statement to buy a firearm. Received a commutation rather than a pardon KWAME KILPATRICK - Detroit mayor from 2002-08 who had his 28-year prison sentence on corruption charges commuted by Trump KENNETH KURSON - Friend of Trump son-in-law Jared Kushner who was charged with cyberstalking during a heated divorce ANTHONY LEVANDOWSKI - Google self-driving car engineer who faced prison for stealing 14,000 files of trade secrets before moving to Uber ELLIOTT BROIDY - GOP fundraiser who pleaded guilty in a scheme to lobby the Trump administration to drop an investigation into the looting of a Malaysian wealth fund MICHAEL 'HARRY O' HARRIS - Founder of Death Row Records who had served 30 years for conspiracy to commit murder. Had his sentence commuted RICK RENZI - GOP congressman from Arizona 2003-09, served three years in prison for corruption, money laundering and other charges DUKE CUNNINGHAM - California GOP congressman 1991-2005, served prison time for accepting $2.4million in bribes from defense contractors ROBIN HAYES - GOP congressman from North Carolina 1999-2009, convicted of lying to FBI agents during a bribery investigation And some of those not on the list... JULIAN ASSANGE - Wikileaks founder facing 18 charges over release of military and diplomatic secrets RUDY GIULIANI - Trump's personal lawyer who had spearheaded efforts to defy the election result JOE EXOTIC - Zookeeper and subject of Netflix series 'Tiger King' who hired a hitman to try to kill a rival DONALD TRUMP - The president had boasted he could pardon himself, but legal scholars thought it doubtful. There were also no pardons for Trump relatives Scroll down for the full list Advertisement

Trump has also pardoned rappers Lil Wayne and Kodak Black who were prosecuted on federal weapons offenses, as well as former Detroit Mayor Kwame Kilpatrick, who was serving a 28-year prison term on corruption charges.

He will also pardon Elliott Broidy, a former top fundraiser for Trump who pleaded guilty last year to violating foreign lobbying laws, Ken Kurson, a friend of Trump son-in-law Jared Kushner who was charged last October with cyberstalking during a heated divorce and Anthony Levandowski, a former Google engineer was sentenced to 18 months in prison for stealing the internet giant's self-driving car files ahead of joining Uber.

But notable names not on the list were Wikileaks founder Julian Assange, Tiger King's Joe Exotic, Trump's personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani or any members of the Trump family, all of whom were rumored to be under consideration.

It also ended years of speculation that Trump would try to immunize himself, an unprecedented and legally questionable step which he had previously claimed he had the power to take.

The list was issued just hours before Trump leaves the White House for the last time and the pardon power, nuclear codes and other trappings of the presidency are transferred to Joe Biden, who will take the oath of office at noon Eastern time.

Leaving under the cloud of a second impeachment and the riot he provoked at the Capitol two weeks ago, Trump wished luck to the new administration in a 'farewell address' last night but did not mention Biden by name and still has not accepted in public that he legitimately lost the election.

Bannon had fallen out with Trump after he was quoted calling the president's son Don Jr. 'treasonous' and his daughter Ivanka 'dumb as a brick'. Trump said then: 'Steve Bannon has nothing to do with me or my presidency.'

But the two men have since rekindled their relationship as Trump sought support for his unproven claims of voter fraud, an official familiar with the situation said. White House officials are said to have advised Trump against pardoning Bannon.

Bannon can still be charged in state court in New York, where a pardon would not help him, said Daniel R. Alonso, a former prosecutor now at the Buckley law firm. Fraud prosecutions are frequently brought by the Manhattan District Attorney's Office, Alonso said.

'Steve Bannon is getting a pardon from Trump after defrauding Trump's own supporters into paying for a wall that Trump promised Mexico would pay for,' Democratic Rep. Adam Schiff said on Twitter. 'And if that all sounds crazy, that's because it is. Thank God we have only 12 more hours of this den of thieves.'

Bannon was in August last year pulled from a luxury yacht and arrested on allegations that he and three associates ripped off donors trying to fund a southern border wall.

The organizers of the 'We Build The Wall' group portrayed themselves as eager to help the president build a 'big beautiful' barrier along the U.S.-Mexico border, as he promised during the 2016 campaign.

They raised more than $25million from thousands of donors and pledged that 100% of the money would be used for the project.

But according to the criminal charges, much of the money never made it to the wall. Instead, it was used to line the pockets of group members, including Bannon, who served in Trump's White House and worked for his campaign.

He allegedly took over $1 million, using some to secretly pay co-defendant Brian Kolfage, an Air Force veteran who lost both legs in a mortar attack in Iraq and the founder of the project, and to cover hundreds of thousands of dollars in personal expenses.";True;1;0.5623975396156311;border_pos;0
https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8205473/Were-not-Dominic-Raab-reads-riot-act-Britons-lockdown.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490;We're not done yet': Dominic Raab reads the riot act to Britons on lockdown;"Dominic Raab read the riot act to Britons ahead of the sunny Easter weekend tonight saying lockdown must stay in force until the coronavirus outbreak peaks.

The Foreign Secretary appealed to the public to keep following social distancing rules as he took the daily Downing Street briefing, insisting there will be no more information about changes to the draconian curbs until at least the end of next week.

In a stark message, Mr Raab - deputising for Boris Johnson as he is treated in intensive care - said the disease must not be allowed to 'kill more people and hurt our country'. 'We're not done yet. We must keep going,' he said.

However, ministers are facing a mounting backlash for stonewalling over their coronavirus 'exit plan', amid fears of massive damage to the economy. Mr Raab hinted this evening that they are avoiding doing so to avoid people 'taking their eye off the ball'. 'We will make the right decisions at the right moment and we will be guided by the science,' he said.

The comments came after Mr Raab chaired the Cobra crisis meeting this afternoon, and the UK recorded another 881 deaths - although in a small relief numbers fell back from the high of almost 1,000 declared yesterday.

Far from easing the lockdown, police have been urging tighter restrictions such as barring people from driving long distances and making it illegal to exercise more than once a day - although Home Secretary Priti Patel batted away the calls tonight.

But the trade-offs involved in the national effort are becoming increasingly clear, with claims two million people have already lost their jobs.

The respected IFS think-tank has warned that more than a million people might suffer long-term illness as a result of the economic misery.

Labour's new leader Keir Starmer said ministers must spell out their 'exit strategy'. 'I'm not calling for precise timings, but the strategy,' he said. 'This is incredibly difficult on people and we need to know that plans are in place, and what they are.'

Downing Street insisted planning is under way across Whitehall for the restrictions to be eased - but flatly refused to say what that might involve, saying the government's focus is on tackling the epidemic.

On another punishing day as the world navigates the biggest crisis in a generation:

Mr Johnson is 'continuing to improve' in intensive care, and he has been sitting up 'engaging' with medical staff treating him at St Thomas' hospital, but Mr Raab said he has not spoken to him since he was admitted;

A respected think-tank has warned that a million people could end up with long-term health conditions as a result of the economic hit from coronavirus lockdown;

The Bank of England has extended the government's Ways and Means provision - effectively its overdraft;

New figures show the economy had effectively flatlined before the coronavirus crisis hit with 0.1 per cent growth in the three months to February;

A bitter row has erupted between the government's chief scientific adviser Patrick Vallance and other experts over whether lockdown measures had been modelled too late in the crisis;

It has emerged that MPs have been offered an extra £10,000 in expenses to help them and staff work from home;

EU officials have accused the UK government of being in 'fantasy land' by insisting the Brexit transition period cannot be extended beyond December;

Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said the disease must not be allowed to 'kill more people and hurt our country' as he took the daily Downing Street briefing

Patel dismisses police calls for tougher lockdown curbs Priti Patel has batted off calls from police chiefs for laws to ban Britons from driving long distances and flouting the rule to exercise more than once a day. Officers in Windermere, Cumbria, are already sending people in camper vans home, while locals in St Ives, Cornwall, blocked some roads to protect vulnerable residents. Police have also created online forms for people to report potential breaches of the lockdown which was imposed on March 23 to fight the coronavirus pandemic. At least five chief constables are said to be backing more stringent restrictions and clearer rules - including legislation to enforce the order to limit exercise to a one-hour period outdoors after some people flouted it to sunbathe in parks or beaches. Northamptonshire Police said the 'three-week grace period is over' and suggested they may even start searching shopping trolleys, but how this would work is unclear. However, Ms Patel said in a radio interview this evening that the government is 'absolutely not' proposing to ramp up the lockdown measures. Currently, police can fine people or simply tell them to move. The emergency Coronavirus Act gives ministers sweeping powers to impose restrictions on 'events and gatherings', which it appears could be deployed to cover unnecessary travel. According to the legislation this can cover 'any vehicle, train, vessel or aircraft', as well as 'any tent or moveable structure'.

The UK has recorded 881 more coronavirus deaths today, taking Britain's total to 7,978 as its coronavirus crisis rumbles on and 4,344 more positive tests pushed the number of patients, past and present, to 65,077.

The grim tally is considerably smaller than the devastating 938 announced yesterday but still represents the second biggest surge since the epidemic began almost six weeks ago. Britain has so far managed to avoid the dark milestone of announcing 1,000 deaths in a single day, something that has only happened in the US.

NHS England announced 765 more fatalities in its hospitals among patients aged between 24 and 103, taking England's total to 7,248, and 116 deaths were announced in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.

Experts say it is still too soon to see the impact of the UK's lockdown in daily statistics but, speaking in today's Government briefing, chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance said 'the NHS can cope' with the current situation. Professor Chris Whitty, chief medical adviser, added 'there is still room' in intensive care units.

In a direct appeal to the public, Mr Raab said: 'Above all, as we go into this long bank holiday weekend I think people should think very long and hard, not just about the guidance and the importance of keeping it up, but about what happens to those on the NHS frontline who are doing a heroic job, if people in large numbers don't comply with those rules.

'I would urge everyone just to take a moment before they do anything however warm it is, however great the temptation, just to think about the sacrifices those on the frontline, particularly in our NHS are making.'

Mr Raab said: 'While the early signs suggest that they are having the impact we need to see, it's too early to say that conclusively.

'Sage (the Scientific Advisory Group on Emergencies) will meet next week to discuss the latest evidence and we will keep the measures we've put in place under review.'

Mr Raab added: 'We don't expect to be able to say more on this until the end of next week.

'The measures will have to stay in place until we've got the evidence that clearly shows we've moved beyond the peak.'

No10 has made clear the PM will not be participating in any government business while he battles the disease in intensive care - meaning decisions are in the hands of Mr Raab and Cabinet.

Asked if he had spoken to Mr Johnson since taking over his responsibilities, Mr Raab said: 'Not yet, I think it's important particularly while he's in intensive care to let him focus on the recovery.

'We in the Government have got this covered. I chaired the Cobra meeting that I have just come from, we are pursuing all the different strands of our strategy to defeat the coronavirus and I'm confident we'll get there.'

Nicola Sturgeon preempted the hard line on lockdown this morning, before she even attended the Cobra meeting. 'I don't think there is any possibility, any likelihood of these lockdown measures being lifted immediately, or even imminently,' she told Sky News.

She added: 'I wouldn't expect any change coming out of today's Cobra meeting but we will see where the discussions take us.'

Although a review of lockdown must happen next week by law, there is now no chance of it being lifted. Senior politicians are set to launch a 'Stay at Home This Easter' publicity drive later designed to avert an exodus of sunseekers.

A report from the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) today raised fresh questions about the trade-offs involved in the extreme curbs, which are intended to stop hundreds of thousands being killed by the disease.

The IFS said there is debate over 'whether the adverse health effects of a recession may be greater than the increased morbidity and mortality within the pandemic itself'.

It stressed that the scale of the economic hit from the lockdown is unclear, but is likely to be 'much larger' than the 2008 credit crunch which meant 900,000 more people of working age developed serious health issues.

Another 500,000 are estimated to have suffered poor mental health as a result of that crisis.

If the economic hit is twice as large it would be expected to lead to 1.8million people enduring chronic illness, and a million mental health issues.

In a sign of the intensifying strain on the country's finances, the Government said it has expanded its overdraft with the Bank of England to ensure it has sufficient cash to cope with disruption.

Government extends 'overdraft' with the Bank of England The Government has expanded its overdraft with the Bank of England to ensure it has sufficient cash to cope with coronavirus disruption.

It said the central bank will directly finance the extra spending the Government needs on a temporary basis.

The Treasury and the Bank of England said, in a joint statement, that it would minimise the need to raise additional funding from bond markets or currency markets.

The Government's bank account at the central bank, historically known as the Ways & Means Facility, will rise to an undisclosed amount.

Ministers will be able to spend more in the short term without having to tap into the bond markets, as a result of the move.

Any money drawn from the facility, which usually stands at around £400million, will be paid back as soon as possible before the end of the year, the Treasury said.

The measure was last used during the 2008 financial crisis, which saw its value increase briefly to £19billion.

Meanwhile, police chiefs are calling for laws to ban Britons from driving long distances and flouting the rule to exercise more than once a day ahead of a hot Easter weekend.

Officers in Windermere, Cumbria, are already sending people in camper vans home, while locals in St Ives, Cornwall, blocked some roads to protect vulnerable residents.

Police have also created online forms for people to report potential breaches of the lockdown which was imposed on March 23 to fight the coronavirus pandemic.

At least five chief constables are said to be backing more stringent restrictions and clearer rules - including legislation to enforce the order to limit exercise to a one-hour period outdoors after some people flouted it to sunbathe in parks or beaches.

Northamptonshire Police said the 'three-week grace period is over' and suggested they may even start searching shopping trolleys, but how this would work is unclear.

This chart released by the government at the daily briefing shows transport use is down 60 per cent compared with early February, and has remained steady in the past week. However, there are still warnings too many people are heading outdoors unnecessarily

The number of coronavirus patient in critical care in the UK increased by 43 per cent in the past seven days and 5 per cent in the past 24 hours

There has been a 2 per cent increase in the number of people in hospital with Covid-19 in the past 24 hours

Currently, police can fine people or simply tell them to move. The emergency Coronavirus Act gives ministers sweeping powers to impose restrictions on 'events and gatherings', which it appears could be deployed to cover unnecessary travel.

According to the legislation this can cover 'any vehicle, train, vessel or aircraft', as well as 'any tent or moveable structure'. The Health Secretary can issue a 'direction' prohibiting events of a 'specified description' to stop the transmission of the virus.

However, the law does not include any provision that could force people to have prior permission, show paperwork, or have reasonable cause to leave the house.

The PM's spokesman said 'the police have our full backing, and the public's as well'. He added that police should 'engage, encourage and then enforce'.

The Government confirmed that anyone caught sunbathing would be asked to move on by police, with a Downing Street spokesman saying: 'People should not be going to parks or beaches to sunbathe. It goes against our rules on essential movement.'

Vaccine 'could be ready by the Autumn' Oxford University researchers are confident they can roll out a vaccine for coronavirus within the next eight months. This 'best case scenario' is much sooner than was previously touted. Britain's chief scientific adviser said it would be at least 2021 until a vaccine was ready. But the Oxford team, one of hundreds worldwide racing to develop a COVID-19 cure, warned it will be 'challenging' if the outbreak peaks before a jab is ready for trials. With no tests available to identify who has already been infected it could be difficult to find unexposed people to take part in the trial, the researchers say. More than 500 volunteers aged between 18 and 55 have signed up to the trial and will begin tests towards the end of the month. Modelling by researchers at the University of Washington predicts Britain will hit its peak on April 17. So far the virus has killed 7,100 and infected 55,000 in the UK. The researchers told The Telegraph: 'The best-case scenario is that by the autumn of 2020 we have the results about the effectiveness of the vaccine from a phase III trial and the ability to manufacture large amounts of the vaccine.' They admitted that this time frame was 'highly ambitious' many things could get in the way of that target. 'At the moment it is not possible to identify who has already been infected,' they added, 'and if the virus is spreading quickly throughout the population it might be difficult to find unexposed people to take part in the trial. 'Conducting trials after the peak subsides presents another problem, because so many people will have developed a natural immunity by then, and the amount of transmission will have dropped so that those who are still not immune will take longer to be exposed to the virus.'

Devon and Cornwall Police are threatening to fine holidaymakers and second home owners who try to enter the area for the Easter weekend and refuse them entry.

Locals have already told the council about 650 cases of holiday lets and second home owners who have arrived in Cornwall in the five days before the weekend.

Polling by King's College London and Ipsos Mori showed nine out of ten people support the lockdown.

Sung-Il Cho, professor of epidemiology at Seoul National University, told The Daily Telegraph that cases ought to drop below 50 per fortnight before moves towards a 'gradual recovery.'

Modelling by the newspaper found that for the UK that would mean waiting until the middle of next month.

The South Koreans have been able to bring the virus to heel by a stringent testing regime, contact tracing and quarantines. They have recorded just 200 deaths without imposing a lockdown and record 53 new cases each day.

Professor Chis Whitty, the Chief Medical Officer, echoed Mr Sunak, saying that there would be no talk of an exit strategy until 'we are confident we are beyond the peak.'

However, experts have warned that returning to life after lockdown won't be a return to normality. Many anticipate that there will be a vicious resurgence of the disease in the autumn.

Prof David Alexander, of University College London's institute for risk and disaster reduction, told The Telegraph: 'Britain and other countries should hold themselves ready to return to lockdown, possibly with more stringent conditions than before. In the autumn, a second wave of Covid-19 could occur and could be devastating.'

Another option is to allow the young and healthy to return to work, while others continue with the strict 'stay at home' guidance.

But the majorities of scientists believe the government will opt for the strategy of beating the numbers of cases down to a tiny level before proceeding with any liberation of the populace.

PM 'continues to improve' says Downing Street Boris Johnson is 'continuing to improve' in intensive care and engaging with medical staff treating him for coronavirus, it was revealed today. Downing Street relayed more positive signs about the Prime Minister's health saying he had a 'good night' although he is still receiving oxygen. 'The PM had a good night and continues to improve in intensive care at St Thomas's. He is in good spirits,' his spokesman said. However, there is no sign Mr Johnson will be able to take part in decisions over the outbreak ravaging the country, after No10 confirmed yesterday that he is not working. In a round of interviews earlier, Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden said the premier was doing 'reasonably well'. Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab is chairing a meeting of the Cobra emergency committee later that is expected to signal the lockdown will continue for weeks longer despite mounting fears over the economic hit. He told BBC Breakfast this morning: 'He's stable, improving, sat up and engaged with medical staff. 'I've known the Prime Minister for a long time and I wish him well in this difficult time and I think things are getting better for him.' Advertisement

And even if that were achieved, life would not suddenly resume as it was before the draconian measures were placed upon us.

Dr Joe Grove, of UCL's department of infection and immunity, told The Telegraph: 'Once the current epidemic peak has passed, simply returning to life as usual would likely trigger another epidemic.

'Ultimately, the only way we can shake off the shackles of Covid-19 is widespread immunity and the only safe way to achieve that is through vaccination. In the meantime, testing gives us a route to some semblance of normality.'

Downing Street has meanwhile expressed grave fears that people will defy its regulations to go out and enjoy the Easter Monday bank holiday sunshine.

The Government is to formally set down its extension at the start of next week after processing three weeks' worth of figures.

Opinion polls show the public still backs the lockdown after the coronavirus claimed a record 938 deaths on Wednesday.

The WHO also agreed with the Government's position yesterday, Dr Hans Kluge warned: 'Now is not the time to relax measures.'

The Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies, chaired by Sir Patrick Vallance, will tomorrow meet to discuss how the current regulations on public freedoms have affected the infection and death rates.

Italy, which has recorded the highest number of deaths in the world, extended their lockdown, which started on March 9, until mid-May.

Officials have often reminded Britons that we are two weeks behind the Italians.

Britain's highest daily death toll was 938 yesterday.

That compares to Italy's highest of 919 on March 28, and Spain's 950 fatalities on April 3.

'We are out of lockdown, but sneeze and you're shunned': Briton living in Wuhan reveals how the joy of freedom after 76 days is tainted by China's draconian security measures on the streets

As lockdown in Wuhan is finally lifted, a 32-year-old British expat who has been working in the city for several years sends this vivid despatch on the realities of freedom.

At midnight on Tuesday, I was woken up by whoops and cheers of 'Come on Wuhan' as my neighbours in this city of 11 million that spawned the coronavirus pandemic celebrated the formal end of quarantine after 77 long, frustrating days.

For a week, I'd been permitted to leave my compound on specific errands for up to two hours, but yesterday was the first day that I could come and go as I pleased.

The shops are reopening so I can buy razors and give myself a proper shave – re-using the same razor for almost three months has been a nightmare. I can finally get a haircut, too.

The 32-year-old British expat said: 'Freedom after so long is welcome but nerve-wracking.' Pictured: Workers wearing facemasks make a barbecue at a market in Wuhan

And some restaurants have resumed service.

The first thing I did was to go to my favourite noodle restaurant for its beef special that is so delicious I've had it for breakfast, lunch and dinner on the same day.

The local Starbucks is busy and a nearby bar has just had its first beer delivery for more than two months. Before the virus hit, life in China was all about convenience. If you wanted to get a toothbrush delivered at 4am, then you could.

But under lockdown we'd wait three days for a community delivery of specific goods: fresh vegetables, meat – mostly pork – rice and flour.

If you fancied something different, tough. I went out early yesterday morning and was surprised by the number of people and cars on the streets.

But it was rush hour and the crowds were an indication of a widespread return to work.

Roadblocks on highways leading in and out of the city have also been removed.

Life is being breathed back into the city, which is the capital of Hubei, a province that has suffered 67,803 cases of Covid-19 and 3,213 deaths, according to official figures.

Citizens can now travel between cities again and the local airport is back in business.

There were no fewer than 200 flights scheduled to depart Wuhan yesterday, carrying 10,000 passengers.

Tens of thousands more left on 100 high-speed trains. Day care centres, schools and colleges remain shut dependent on a ruling from Beijing on when they can reopen, but it surely won't be long.

Yes, normality is returning but darker undertones persist. Freedom after so long is welcome but nerve-wracking.

Every few days, security guards come banging on my door – it can happen early in the morning or late at night – and three people in full protective clothing, visors and masks will come and have a look around my apartment and check me for signs of fever with a 'thermometer gun'.

Another person records the procedure on a mobile phone.

Out on the streets it's the same story – security guards armed with thermometer 'guns' to do spot checks maintain a highprofile presence, while trucks cruise the streets spraying disinfectant.

And many people are continuing to wear facemasks. There is still tension and wariness here.

Cough or sneeze on the street and people will cross the road to avoid you. Anyone who looks sick is treated like a leper.

To Western eyes, the mass surveillance and monitoring is draconian.

Each citizen is allocated a unique QR code, via the WeChat app, that serves as proof they are healthy.

The QR code is linked to an individual's government ID card and includes details of a blood test and health check that show they are virus-free.

No one is allowed to leave a gated community, use public transport or visit shopping malls or buy food without having scanned their code.

Foreigners like me are not entitled to a QR code. I carry a letter from my doctor testifying to my virus-free status which I show along with my ID card.

This is the reality that has replaced lockdown now. To be checked and checked again.

Will it be enough to stop a second wave of infections? I hope so.

Wuhan is paying a high economic price for the lockdown.

The seafood market identified as the most likely source of this new strain of coronavirus outbreak remains sealed off by blue police tape, and is heavily patrolled by officers.

Walk down any street and you will see stores that have been abandoned because retailers can no longer afford to pay the rent.

Clothing shops, speciality restaurants, and even some banks are still closed with trash piling up outside.

No wonder many of the people who came to Wuhan from the countryside to find work left at the first opportunity yesterday. But people are returning.

The Wuhan quarantine was put in place during the Spring Festival, as the Chinese New Year celebration is known, a time when many people had left the city to visit family in their hometowns.

From my window I see young couples laden with luggage moving back to homes they have not lived in since January.

And this brings me to a problem that many here might rather stayed hidden.

Some of those who left Wuhan to celebrate the beginning of the Year of the Rat elsewhere, left their cats, dogs and other pets behind with enough water and food for a few days.

After all, they'd be back very soon...";True;1;0.7211458683013916;border_pos;0

Ted Cruz's wife Heidi texted friends and neighbors urging them to 'escape for the week' and join them in sunny Cancun before the family fled Texas during a deadly energy crisis, it has been revealed.

Cruz, Heidi and their daughters Caroline, 12, and Cathryn, 10, fled Houston on Wednesday afternoon while millions in Texas struggled without heat or water.

Their trip to the Ritz-Carlton in Cancun sparked outrage, with many demanding to know why Cruz - a two term Senator who was re-elected in 2013 - didn't stay behind to help alleviate the crisis like other leaders and private citizens.

Cruz changed his flight at 6am on Thursday after a firestorm of outrage erupted overnight. On Thursday afternoon, he released a statement saying his 'girls' had asked him if they could go away with friends the day before and the family quickly booked the trip.

He said he was just 'trying to be a good dad' by dropping them off, and that he was returning to Texas to battle the energy crisis.

But text messages obtained by The New York Times show how Heidi encouraged other mothers on the street they live on to join them.

On Wednesday morning, she wrote: 'Anyone can or want to leave for the week? We may go to Cancun there is a direct flight at 445pm and hotels w capacity. Seriously. Covid test to come back which we will take there.'

Another mother responded: 'We are now thinking along those lines. Sounds so wonderful.' Another said: We are supposed to go to Cabo Friday.'

Heidi then booked the family's flights and informed the group and told them where they planned to stay: 'Ritz Carlton. $309 plus tax.'

One of the other mothers replied: 'Cancun Cabo even Boston sounds amazing!!! I would live (sic) to go but not freezing under the down comforter with hot chilies and a hoodie and sadly I can't leave [redacted] or my mother in law.'

Heidi, a managing director in Goldman Sachs' Houston office, also asked their friends: 'Are you guys warm enough? We have a fireplace! Let us know. Our house is FREEZING tho... we couldn't stand it anymore.'

Their daughters were never referenced in the exchange.

Hours later, the Cruzes were at the airport. They left behind their dog - Snowflake - which was spotted by a reporter staring forlornly out of the front door on Thursday, before the Senator arrived back home.

In an interview on Thursday night, Ted admitted he regretted going.

'My girls said school's been cancelled, can we take a trip and go somewhere warm. And Heidi and I, as parents, we said OK, sure,' he told Sean Hannity.

On Thursday night, Cruz doubled down on the excuse, telling ABC 13 during an interview at his Houston home: 'They said, 'Look, lets take a trip. Lets go with some of our friends and lets get out of here and lets go somewhere warm. And Heidi and I said ... lets go.'

'You question what I was thinking, and ... I was trying to take care of my family.

'I was trying to take care of my kids. It's unfortunate, the fire storm that came from it.

'It was not my intention. In saying yes to my daughters to somehow diminish all the Texans that were going through real hardship.'

Ted Cruz was fiercely criticized for his jaunt, and swiftly returned on realizing the terrible PR move.

He landed back in Houston on Thursday afternoon and said he 'regrets' flying to Cancun in the middle of the state's energy crisis for a vacation - but insisted he was 'just trying to be a dad'.

'It was obviously a mistake and in hindsight I wouldn't have done it,' he said, speaking on arrival at home in Houston.

'I was trying to be a dad.

'And all of us have made decisions - when you've got two girls who have been cold for two days, and haven't had heat or power, and they are saying: 'Look, we don't have school, why don't we go, let's get out of here.''

He added: 'I think there are a lot of parents that would be like, 'If I can do this, great.'

'That's what I wanted to do. As I said, really from the moment I sat on the plane, I began really second-guessing that decision.'

On Monday night, Cruz spoke on a radio show which airs from 5-8pm, telling the host: 'Thankfully, my home, we didn't lose power.'

This was the situation in Austin and many other parts of Texas while the Senator and his family were in sunny Mexico

The power went out at around 6pm on Tuesday, he told Hannity on Thursday.

His office previously told DailyMail.com that the power went out on Monday night.

Protesters at Houston airport held out signs as he landed on Thursday that read: '24 dead'.

Others gathered outside his home to show their anger at his jaunt.

They yelled: 'Resign!' as he spoke to local media outside his home.

He also claimed that the girls asked him 'yesterday' if they could go away, and he and Heidi 'agreed'.

Within hours they were all on the plane.

Temperatures plummeted to as low as -2F in Texas this week and snow and ice has blanketed much of the state. It has been 85 F and sunny in Cancun all week by contrast.

Cruz was slammed for both the trip and for seeming to blame it on his kids once people started criticizing him for it.

Before he released his statement, sources told Fox and The New York Times that the trip was pre-planned.

Cruz was also carrying a large carry-on which suggested he planned to stay for longer than just one night.

He later admitted he intended to stay 'throughout the weekend'.

Heidi Cruz's texts said she planned on returning to Houston on Sunday evening, landing back in the Texan city at 6pm after a four night break at the luxury Mexican beach resort.

Cruz released statement on Thursday claiming he was just escorting his wife and daughters to Texas, that the trip was last minute and that they'd also lost power. United sources said he changed his flight at 6am on Thursday amid a swell of criticism

Before flying on Wednesday, Cruz requested a police escort through Houston airport, before his flight to Cancun at around 4pm.

He was pictured at the United Airlines lounge, at the gate and on the plane before take-off.

He was also on the standby list for an upgrade to business class but didn't get it.

His wife Heidi's name wasn't on the list for an upgrade.

The family was planning on staying in a resort they've visited before, sources said, though it's unclear which exactly.

Temperatures in Texas this week dropped as low as -2 F - the lowest they have been since 1903 - and snow and ice is blanketing the state.

By contrast, it is 85 F and sunny all week.

Cruz pictured arriving on Thursday at Cancun Airport amid uproar over his planned vacation to Mexico in the middle of an energy crisis in Texas

U.S. Senator Ted Cruz speaks to the media at the Cancun International Airport before boarding his plane back to the U.S., in Cancun, Mexico February 18, 2021. He was wearing a Texas mask and spoke briefly to Telemundo, a local station, amid uproar over his planned vacation during the worst energy crisis Texas has ever seen

Ted Cruz checks in for a flight at Cancun International Airport

Cruz was due to return on Saturday, but as criticism of the trip exploded on Thursday morning, with many furious Texans demanding to know why he hadn't stayed behind to help in the crisis, he changed his plans.

He was on the list for a business class upgrade on one of the afternoon flights out of Cancun on Thursday afternoon.

To re-enter the US from a foreign country, all passengers must first test negative for COVID-19 by law.

They're then advised by the CDC to obtain a negative COVID test again, three to five days after they return, and quarantine for a full seven days after they return. Texas has no quarantine laws for entering from another country or state.

According to ABC, his office contacted the Houston Police Department staff at the airport and 'requested assistance' on Wednesday before his outbound flight.

'HPD officers monitored his movements through the terminal,' a spokesman for the force said.

The situation in Texas is so bad that people are being told to boil water before drinking to reduce any possible contaminants due to a failure in water pressure and plants.

Many can't because they don't have the power to do it.

Cruz on Monday said that his home hadn't lost power, and that he and his wife had welcomed in their children's friends who weren't as lucky.

CRUZ'S CONFLICTING COMMENTS MONDAY 'Thankfully, my home, we didn't lose power. 'If you can stay home, don't go out on the roads, don't risk the ice. … 'Don't risk it. Keep your family safe, and just stay home and hug your kids.' THURSDAY MORNING, IN A STATEMENT: 'Like millions of Texans, our family lost heat and power too. 'With school canceled for the week, our girls asked to take a trip with friends. Wanting to be a good dad, I flew down with them last night and am flying back this afternoon.' THURSDAY AFTERNOON, TO KTRT: 'It was obviously a mistake and in hindsight I wouldn't have done it. I was trying to be a dad. THURSDAY EVENING, TO HANNITY: 'I started to have second thoughts almost immediately. 'Because the crisis here in Texas you need to be on the ground, because as much as you can do by phone and Zoom, it's not the same. 'So I returned this afternoon and I'm here working to do everything we can to get the power turned on.' Advertisement

'Thankfully, my home, we didn't lose power.

'So right now we've got a bunch of the neighborhood kids all over playing with our girls, because their parents lost power and our house was lucky.

'So we've got kids running up and down the stairs right now,' he told radio host Joe Paglialuro on Monday.

He went on: 'If you can stay home, don't go out on the roads, don't risk the ice... Don't risk it.

'Keep your family safe, and just stay home and hug your kids.'

On top of outrage over Cruz's trip, he was also mocked and compared to New Jersey Governor Chris Christie who closed all of the state's public beaches in 2017 during a government shutdown over a budget standoff, then took his family to the beach.

People have abandoned their frozen homes in Texas to seek warmth in shelters across the state.

On Thursday morning, the Mayor of Galveston said the 'human suffering' he was witnessing was 'very concerning' and that the situation was worse than any hurricane the state has experienced because it's affecting the whole state and not just the coast.

Cruz was shown on the list of passengers waiting for an upgrade from coach to business on Wednesday night, under his given name Rafael Edward Cruz.

He was inundated with criticism from people who called him 'morally bankrupt'.

An unnamed Republican source confirmed to FOX News that it was Cruz at the airport.

'The photos speak for themselves,' they said.

He had earlier been forced to admit he had 'no defense' after an August 2020 tweet mocking power outages in California resurfaced.

Cruz tweeted Wednesday: 'I got no defense. A blizzard strikes Texas & our state shuts down. Not good. Stay safe!'

He had said: 'California is now unable to perform even basic functions of civilization, like having reliable electricity.

'Biden/Harris/AOC want to make CA's failed energy policy the standard nationwide. Hope you don't like air conditioning!'

Ted Cruz is pictured on Wednesday afternoon at Houston Airport jetting to Cancun with his wife and kids on a United Airlines flight while more than 3million Texans were freezing in their homes without power.

After images of Cruz at the airport surfaced online Sawyer Hackett, senior advisor and communications for Mayor of San Antonio Julian Castro tweeted: 'It appears in the middle of the worst energy crisis in the history of Texas, @tedcruz is on his way to Cancun with his family.'

Beto O'Rourke was among those who criticized him.

'Cruz seems to believe there isn't much for him to do in Texas for the millions of fellow Texans who remain without electricity/water and are literally freezing,' he tweeted on Wednesday night.

Hackett later called for Cruz to 'resign or be expelled immediately'.

Twitter user Elsa Ramon posted: 'My 73-yo dad lives in Austin and is sleeping in full winter camping gear.

He sits in his running truck with the heater on during the day for warmth, @tedcruz. Enjoy Cancun, you morally bankrupt piece of s***.'

National Weather Service lead forecaster Bob Oravec had earlier said of Texas: 'There's really no letup to some of the misery people are feeling across that area.'

Pictures then emerged of Cruz waiting in line to check in his bags and boarding the flight to Mexico.

This week's extreme weather has been blamed for the deaths of more than 30 people, some of whom perished while struggling to keep warm inside their homes.

In the Houston area, one family succumbed to carbon monoxide from car exhaust in their garage. Another family died while using a fireplace to keep warm.

Leonel Solis and Estefani Garcia use their car to heat their home in East Dallas area of Dallas on Wednesday. The couple, who lost power on Sunday, have been using electricity from a neighbor's generator and heat from their car to stay warm

The president of the Texas power grid manager, the Electric Reliability Council of Texas, said he hoped many customers would see at least partial service restored by later Wednesday or Thursday.

Problems first began with Winter Storm Uri - a brutal weather system that is sweeping the country. Every other state in the storm's path has been able to withstand it because they operate on a shared power source which means that if one state's supply goes down, it can draw from the shared reserve.

But furious Texans now want to know why the state's infrastructure wasn't properly prepared, especially after a similar storm in 2011 caused the same problems. The Texas Tribune reports that not all of the generators in the state were upgraded after 2011 to tackle the issue.

Jeff Dennis, managing director of Advanced Energy Economy, said: 'Where did those recommendations go, and how were they implemented? Those are going to be some pretty key questions.'

The upgrades are what's called 'winterizing' the energy system but experts say it is regularly put off because the changes are expensive.

Texas' deregulated energy market gives little financial incentives for operators to prepare for the rare bout of intensely cold weather, an issue critics have been pointing out for years.

Water pressure has fallen across the state because lines have frozen, and many residents are leaving faucets dripping in hopes of preventing pipes from freezing, said Toby Baker, executive director of the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality.

Texas Gov. Greg Abbott urged residents to shut off water to their homes, if possible, to prevent more busted pipes and preserve pressure in municipal systems.

Travel remains ill-advised in much of the United States, with roadways treacherous and thousands of flights canceled.

There are also delays to the COVID-19 vaccine distribution and many doses that were being stored are under threat because the freezers storing them can't operate without power.

And there are also fears that without any new gas becoming available soon, prices are about to skyrocket by as much as 20 cents per gallon.

ERCOT officials still can't say when power will be restored. 'I know it's frustrating we can't offer a time certain, but it's a process we're engaged in to get the grid back in balance,' ERCOT chief executive officer Bill Magness said during a news conference Tuesday.

The gorgeous state known as America's 'last best place' has risen to the top of the suicide charts in recent years.

With its picturesque rolling grasslands stretching across sprawling plains beneath a 'Big Sky' and snow-capped mountains, Montana seems like the perfect place to live a peaceful life.

But it also harbors the perfect storm for suicide rates, according to the National Alliance on Mental Illness.

Social isolation, high proportions of gun ownership, a scarcity of access to mental health care, high rates of substance misuse, racial trauma, high altitude, vitamin D deficiency and long winters all combine to make Montana a suicide hotspot.

'It's in the culture,' Ali Mullen, 46, an activist who lost her husband to suicide in 2021 told the New York Times. 'If you don't know someone, you know of someone who has died.'

The gorgeous state known as America's 'last best place' has risen to the top of the suicide charts in recent years

Ali, a mother-of-three who lives in Helena, a beautiful city surrounded by some of Montana's most picturesque national parks, told the newspaper her husband John Mullen was 40 when he shot himself in their backyard January 2021.

John, a handyman, and Ali, who works for the county health department, met while John was working at what is now the Whitefish Resort. Lovers of the country life, they enjoyed an idyllic life with three kids during the first few years of their marriage.

But John struggled with his mental health during the pandemic, and was hit hard by the state of American politics particularly after January 6.

The riot made him question, 'where is the country going for my kids?' John's boss, Jim Smith, told the Times.

Ali said her husband had stopped sleeping. 'Something changed in him after that,' she told the Times.

John would stay in his room with the blinds drawn rather than go out for beers, and he was prone to mood swings.

Seeing the dark clouds descending, Ali hid the keys to their safe where they kept their guns, initially to protect their children from it. But she put it back when she felt safe that John was getting better.

The evening of January 20, 2021, the Mullen family had just enjoyed dinner together when John left the table and walked outside.

'It's in the culture,' Ali Mullen, 46, an activist who lost her husband to suicide in 2021 told the New York Times . 'If you don't know someone, you know of someone who has died'

Ali sensed something was wrong and followed him out to the yard, but by the time paramedics arrived, John had died. Ali was left to pick up the pieces.

The devastated mother still carried a gun wherever she goes - but she also keeps a gun lock in her handbag for anyone who might need one. The small metal device which blocks the trigger can be found on Amazon for as little as $10.

She has channeled her grief into trying to protect others and raising awareness in her community, which is railed by suicides all too often.

Janet Lindow, chief executive of the Rural Behavioral Health Institute in Livingston, Mont., which screens children for suicide risk, told the Times small communities like Helena are often worst hit.

'There is a lot of strength in a small-town structure, but the downside is that if you lose one person to suicide, it can have a large impact on the community,' she said.

In Montana, a state of 1.1 million people, 955 people died by suicide from January 2021 through November 2023, according to the Times.

Other states in the Mountain West, including Wyoming and New Mexico, also experience higher rates.

Ali joined a group called the LOSS team- Local Outreach to Suicide Survivors - which supports those struggling. Support can be found nationwide through the Suicide and Crisis Lifeline by calling 988.";True;1;0.5555398464202881;border_pos;0

SAG-AFTRA, which represents some 160,000 actors, journalists and other media professionals, said in a statement Tuesday that is board voted ‘overwhelmingly’ that there is probable cause that Trump violated its membership guidelines.

The charges were initiated against Trump by union president Gabrielle Carteris, who accused him of promoting misinformation that inspired the deadly attack, in which five were killed - including a Capitol police officer.

Carteris further noted that the siege also threatened the safety of journalists, a number of whom are SAG-AFTRA members.

‘Donald Trump attacked the values that this union holds most sacred — democracy, truth, respect for our fellow Americans of all races and faiths, and the sanctity of the free press,’ Carteris said in a statement.

‘There’s a straight line from his wanton disregard for the truth to the attacks on journalists perpetrated by his followers.’

The Screen Actors Guild - American Federation of Television and Radio Artists (SAG-AFTRA) is considering expelling Donald Trump from its ranks

Trump has been a SAG member since 1989. His credits include The Apprentice, Saturday Night Live and many cameos in films and TV series including, Home Alone 2: Lost in New York (above), The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air and Sex in and City

SAG-AFTRA, which represents some 160,000 actors, journalists and other media professionals, said in a statement Tuesday that is board voted ‘overwhelmingly’ that there is probable cause that Trump violated its membership guidelines

Under the union’s constitution, the charges will now go to the disciplinary committee for a hearing. The committee reserves the power to issue fines, censures and reprimands.

Carteris said she is seeking the maximum penalty allowable under the union’s rules: expulsion from membership.

Article XIV of the SAG-AFTRA Constitution states that members may be suspended or expelled for ‘engaging in actions antagonistic to the interests or integrity of the union.’ Expulsion requires a two-thirds vote of the national board but the process could take weeks to complete.

David White, the union’s national executive director, also said the threats Trump has posed against journalists is a major catalyst behind their decision.

‘Our most important role as a union is the protection of our members. The unfortunate truth is, this individual’s words and actions over the past four years have presented actual harm to our broadcast journalist members,’ he told Variety.

‘The board’s resolution addresses this effort to undermine freedom of the press and reaffirms the principles on which our democratic society rests, and which we must all work to protect and preserve.’

The union, which is non-partisan and doesn’t endorse political candidates, has previously criticized Trump in the past for referring to the media as the ‘enemy of the American people.’

However, the final straw reportedly came on January 6 when Trump instructed a thousands-strong crowd of MAGA supporters to march on the Capitol and ‘fight like hell’.

‘And if you don’t fight like hell, you’re not going to have a country anymore,’ he said.

Trump has been a SAG member since 1989. His credits include The Apprentice, Saturday Night Live and many cameos in films and TV series including, Home Alone 2: Lost in New York, The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air and Sex in and City.

A White House spokesman didn't immediately respond to a request for comment Tuesday.

Losing SAG membership doesn't disqualify anyone from performing. But most major productions abide by union contracts and hire only union actors.

World leaders and commentators instantly pointed the finger at the Russian president when the news of Navalny's death broke on Friday, with questions around the cause of death fuelled by officials delaying the release of the body.

Some have suggested the 47-year-old dissident was poisoned - as he was in 2020 in a previous assassination attempt - while one source inside the prison colony where Navalny died has claimed he was likely killed by a single punch to the heart.

Vladimir Osechkin, a Russian exile and human rights campaigner, said bruising found on the opposition leader's body was consistent with the 'one-punch' execution method popular among agents of the Soviet Union's KGB security service.

'It is an old method of the KGB's special forces divisions,' Osechkin told The Times.

'They trained their operatives to kill a man with one punch in the heart, in the centre of the body. It was a hallmark of the KGB.'

It doesn't take a keen Kremlin watcher to see Navalny's death as the latest in a long list of attempts to eradicate opponents of Putin over the years.

Kremlin political critics, turncoat spies and investigative journalists have been killed or assaulted by a variety of methods straight off Moscow's assassination menu.

The attacks range from the exotic - poisoned by drinking polonium-laced tea or touching a deadly nerve agent - to the less subtle, such as getting shot at close range or being blown up in a private jet.

Some take a fatal plunge from an open window, and there being several reports of Russian executives dying under mysterious circumstances, although whether they were deliberate killings or suicides is sometimes difficult to determine.

Such killings have not been contained to Russia's borders either.

Suspected Kremlin hit squads have carried out attacks against Putin's enemies across Europe - with questions even being raised this week over the suspected killing of a Russian defector in Spain.

Here, MailOnline looks at the most prominent cases of documented killings or attempted killings, and the methods used by suspected Kremlin assassins.

Poisonings

Although Russian authorities announced Putin's key political challenger had died in an Arctic prison colony on Friday, the details of what exactly happened are unknown.

Russia's Federal Penitentiary Service said Navalny felt unwell after a walk and lost consciousness. An ambulance arrived, but he could not be revived.

Prison officials say they are still establishing why he died, with it being announced that the examination of Navalny's body would take 14 days.

His wife Yulia, his mother and other allies have said this is a ploy from Moscow to allow any toxic substance in his body to dissipate.

There is good reason to suspect Navalny was poisoned: His allies previously accused Russian officials of trying to poison him with a nerve agent in August 2020.

After being poisoned, Navalny was evacuated to a hospital in Germany. The use of a Novichok nerve agent was later confirmed in a lab

Russian intelligence officer Sergei Skripal survived falling very ill after being poisoned

Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia were found on a bench together close to Salisbury Cathedral on the afternoon of March 4 having been poisoned with nerve-agent Novichok

Navalny was flying to Moscow from the Siberian city of Tomsk when he collapsed in the aisle. The plane made an emergency landing in Omsk where he spent two days in a hospital before he was transferred to Germany.

Once there, doctors determined he had been poisoned with a strain of Novichok - a nerve agent developed by the Soviet Union and Russia between 1971 and 1993.

Specialists found traces of the nerve agent on Navalny's underwear and clothes, including his belt, while German special services suggested he could have been poisoned by Novichok in the form of a power dissolved into a liquid, most likely the tea he drank at the airport.

German experts later concluded that only Russian special services could have used such a 'deadly and complex poison' in the attempt on his life.

Russia previously claimed that it had destroyed its stockpile of the poison - which its scientists claim is the deadliest nerve agent ever made.

However, the nerve agent reared its ugly head in an unlikely place in 2018: the small cathedral city of Salisbury in the United Kingdom.

There, former Russian intelligence officer Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia were poisoned by the nerve agent and spent weeks in critical condition.

They survived, but the attack later claimed the life of a British woman Dawn Sturgess and left a man, Charlie Rowley, and police officer Nick Bailey seriously ill.

Authorities said they both were poisoned with the military grade nerve agent Novichok, carried in a small perfume or aftershave bottle which Sturgess and Rowley found in a park.

Britain blamed Russian intelligence, but Moscow denied any role.

British authorities identified two Russian nationals, using the names Alexander Petrov and Ruslan Boshirov, as the suspects behind the attack and alleged that they were active officers in Russian military intelligence.

Investigative journalism outlet Bellingcat went on to identify Boshirov as Colonel Anatoliy Chepiga, a highly decorated GRU officer, and Petrov as Dr. Alexander Yevgeniyevich Mishkin, a trained military doctor - also employed by the GRU.

Both had previously received the Hero of the Russian Federation Award - Russia's highest state award, and both had been active in Ukraine in 2014.

By the time they were charged by the UK, the pair were back in Russia.

The pair went on Russian television to claim they had been visiting Salisbury as tourists, specifically to look at the city's cathedral spire and 14th-century clock.

Putin called Skripal, a double agent for Britain during his espionage career, a 'scumbag' of no interest to the Kremlin because he was tried in Russia and exchanged in a spy swap in 2010.

Skripal was not the only ex-Russian agent to be targeted in the UK.

Investigators in protective gear are seen in England in 2018 following the Salisbury poisonings

In 2006, Russian defector Alexander Litvinenko, a former agent for the KGB and its post-Soviet successor agency, the FSB, became violently ill in London after drinking tea laced with radioactive polonium-210. He died three weeks later.

Litvinenko had been investigating the shooting death of Russian journalist Anna Politkovskaya and the Russian intelligence service's alleged links to organised crime.

Before dying, Litvinenko told journalists the FSB was still operating a poisons laboratory dating from the Soviet era.

A British inquiry found that Russian agents had killed Litvinenko, probably with Putin's approval, but the Kremlin denied any involvement.

There have been other suspected cases of poisoning, too.

In 2018, Pyotr Verzilov, a founder of the protest group Pussy Riot, fell severely ill and also was flown to Berlin, where doctors said poisoning was 'highly plausible.'

He eventually recovered. Earlier that year, Verzilov embarrassed the Kremlin by running onto the field during the World Cup final in Moscow with three other activists to protest police brutality.

His allies said he could have been targeted because of his activism.

Prominent opposition figure Vladimir Kara-Murza survived what he believes were attempts to poison him in 2015 and 2017.

He nearly died from kidney failure in the first instance and suspects poisoning but no cause was determined. He was hospitalised with a similar illness in 2017 and put into a medically induced coma. His wife said doctors confirmed he was poisoned.

Kara-Murza survived, and his lawyer says police have refused to investigate. Last year, he was convicted of treason and sentenced to 25 years in prison.

In January he was moved to a prison in Siberia and placed in solitary confinement over an alleged minor infraction.

Numerous journalists critical of authorities in Russia have been killed or suffered mysterious deaths - including suspected poisonings.

Their colleagues, in some cases, blamed someone in the political hierarchy. In other cases, the reported reluctance by authorities to investigate raised suspicions.

Yuri Shchekochikhin, a reporter at the newspaper Novaya Gazeta, died of a sudden and violent illness in 2003.

Shchekochikhin was investigating corrupt business deals and the possible role of Russian security services in the 1999 apartment house bombings blamed on Chechen insurgents.

His colleagues insisted that he was poisoned and accused the authorities of deliberately hindering the investigation.

Shootings

The highest profile killing of a political opponent in recent years was that of Boris Nemtsov. Once deputy prime minister under Boris Yeltsin - Putin's predecessor - Nemtsov was a popular politician and harsh critic of Putin.

On a cold February night in 2015, he was gunned down by assailants on a bridge adjacent to the Kremlin as he walked with his girlfriend.

His death shocked the country.

Five men from the Russian region of Chechnya were convicted for his killing, with the gunman receiving up to 20 years.

But Nemtsov's allies said that was an attempt to shift blame from the government, and an investigation by journalists from Insider, Bellingcat and the BBC found he had been shadowed by FSB agents for almost a year before he was killed.

Politkovskaya, another journalist at Novaya Gazeta - whose death Litvinenko was investigating - was shot and killed in the elevator of her Moscow apartment building on October 7, 2006 - Putin's birthday.

She had won international acclaim for her reporting on human rights abuses in Chechnya.

The gunman, from Chechnya, was convicted of the killing and sentenced to 20 years in prison. Four other Chechens were given shorter prison terms for their involvement in the murder.

Like poisonings, shootings have not been contained to Russia's borders, either.

In the summer of 2019, Zelimkhan Khangoshvili - a Georgian citizen who fought against Russia during the Chechen war in the early 2000s - was shot twice in the head at close range in a park in central Berlin.

Alleged FSB agent Vadim Krasikov was jailed for life by a German judge, for what the judge called a 'painstakingly planned' hit job.

They said Russian security services had provided Krasikov with a false identity, a fake passport and the means to carry out the assassination.

Krasikov is the only suspected FSB agent to have been caught and convicted abroad for murder, and Moscow has attempted to include him in a prisoner exchange with the West on numerous occasions.

Other notable shooting assassinations during Putin's reign as President include Movladi Baisarov, a Chechen warlord and former FSB special-task unit commander, who was shot dead on the street in central Moscow in 2006.

Umar Israilov - the former bodyguard of Chechen warlord Ramzan Kadyrov - was shot dead with two bullets to the head in Vienna in 2009.

That same year, Sulim Yamadayev - Lieutenant Colonel of Special Battalion Vostok and a Chechen rebel commander from the First Chechen War - was shot in the neck and killed while in Dubai.

Even since the death of Alexei Navalny, a shooting abroad has raised eyebrows.

A Russian pilot who defected to Ukraine with a military helicopter is reported to have been found dead in Spain last week.

Maxim Kuzminov flew his Mi-8 helicopter into Ukraine in August in a brazen operation, saying he opposed Russia's military offensive.

The full details of the shooting only came to light this week, with a spokesman for Russia's GRU intelligence agency confirming to AFP news agency on Tuesday that Kuzminov had died without providing details.

So far, Spanish authorities have refused to say if a bullet-riddled body found was his, but Spanish media - citing sources close to the investigation - have since Monday reported that a body of a man found riddled with bullets in the southeastern coastal town of Villajoyosa near Alicante last Tuesday was that of the defector.

A judicial source told AFP that the body found at the entrance to a residential complex had identity papers which corresponded to a 33-year-old Ukrainian.

Spanish police had initially been investigating the crime as a case of 'score-settling' in the area, which has a large Russian community, the source added.

Authorities later located the man's burnt-out car in a nearby town, which his killers are suspected of having used to flee the scene, according to Spanish media reports.

Kuzminov, who served in the 319th separate helicopter regiment based in Russia's far eastern Primorsky region, said in August he had secretly organized his defection for months with the Ukrainian intelligence services and called on other Russian servicemen to do the same.

Two fellow servicemen on the helicopter were not aware of his plans and were killed when they tried to flee after it landed in Ukraine, according to the GRU.

While the reports have not been confirmed by Spanish authorities, Moscow celebrated the news that Kuzminov had died.

'This traitor and criminal became a moral corpse at the very moment when he planned his dirty and terrible crime,' Russian state news agencies quoted Sergei Naryshkin, the head of Russia's SVR foreign intelligence service, as saying.

He did not confirm or deny any Russian involvement in the former pilot's death.

In October, Russian state TV reported that Russia's GRU intelligence agency had 'been given the order' to eliminate Kuzminov.

'It's just a matter of time,' a journalist for Russia's Perviy Kanal said in a TV report after talking to Russian special forces, who claimed to be on the hunt for the 'traitor.'

Unexplained deaths

There have also been several reports of prominent Russian executives dying under mysterious circumstances, including falls from a great height.

In 2013, Boris Berezovsky was found dead at his home in Ascot, UK - apparently hanged in his bathroom.

Berezovsky was a former Kremlin insider who became a vocal critic of Putin's government, and who entered self-imposed exile in the UK in the early 2000s.

Investigations and public inquiries were carried out into his death, but they did not establish anything beyond suicide being the cause of death.

However, a German forensic scientist - hired by members of Berezovsky's family - said his examination of autopsy photographs had led him to conclude that the Russian had not killed himself.

A number of Berezovsky's associates have also died under suspicious circumstances in the United Kingdom.

Georgian oligarch and Berezovsky's business partner Badri Patarkatsishvili died mysteriously in 2008 - in Leatherhead, Surrey. He had close ties to Roman Abramovich, Alexander Litvinenko, Mikheil Saakashvili and Putin himself.

In 2018, Nikolai Glushkov was found dead in New Malden, London - just one week after the poisoning of Sergei and Yulia Skripal in Salisbury.

He too was a critic of the Kremlin, with a coroner in 2021 ruling that Glushkov was unlawfully killed, and that his death was made to look like a suicide.

Yukos oil founder Yuri Golubev also died in London, in 2007.

There have also been several unexplained deaths in Russia.

Just last year, in February 2023, defence official Marina Yankina, 58, was found dead after plunging 160ft from a tower block window.

She is believed to have fallen from the 16th floor to her death.

Ms Yankina was a key figure in the funding of Vladimir Putin's illegal war in Ukraine as head of the financial support department of the Ministry of Defence for the Western Military District, which is closely involved in the dictator's invasion.

And in 2022, a string of deaths raised suspicions.

Ravil Ulfatovich Maganov, a Russian oligarch and chairman of national oil company Lukoil, allegedly 'died after falling from a sixth-floor window at the Moscow Central Clinical Hospital' on September 1 2022, reports said at the time.

Marina Yankina (pictured), 58, was discovered by a passerby at the entrance of a house on Zamshina Street in St Petersburg in 2022. She is believed to have fallen 160ft to her death

He had reportedly been hospitalised for a heart attack, with Lukoil saying he 'passed away following a severe illness'. However, Russia's TASS news agency reported his death as a suicide, and said he had been taking antidepressants.

Russia news site Baza suggested Maganov - a Putin critic - may have fallen from a balcony, and claimed CCTV footage was not available because cameras had been 'turned off for repairs'.

This only added to suspicions around his death, which came months after Lukoil's board of directors issued a statement calling for a quick end to Putin's invasion of Ukraine, which began on February 24, 2022.

There were several other unexplained deaths that year.

Ivan Pechorin, 39, director of the Far East and Arctic Development Corporation 'fell overboard' from his yacht in September; Pavel Pchelnikov, 52, a PR manager for the Russian Railways was shot dead in his Moscow apartment the same month; and Alexander Tyulakov, 61, a senior Gazprom executive found hanged at his house.

And in another case a mobile phone multi-millionaire and his wife were found stabbed to death, with the official version of events raising questions.

Naked Yevgeny Palant, 47, and his wife Olga, 50, both Ukrainian-born, were found with multiple knife wounds by their daughter Polina, 20.

Immediate briefing to the media claimed the woman took her own life in a jealous rage after Palant said he was leaving her.

Yet this was strongly disputed by the couple's best friend.

A plane crash last August which killed Yevgeny Prigozhin and top lieutenants of his Wagner private military company came two months to the day after he launched an armed rebellion that Putin labeled 'a stab in the back' and 'treason.'

While not critical of Putin, Prigozhin slammed the Russian military leadership and questioned the motives for going to war in Ukraine.

A US intelligence assessment found that the crash that killed all 10 people aboard was intentionally caused by an explosion, according to US and Western officials.

The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorised to comment. One said the explosion fell in line with Putin's 'long history of trying to silence his critics.'

Putin's spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, rejected allegations the Kremlin was behind the crash. 'Of course, in the West those speculations are put out under a certain angle, and all of it is a complete lie,' he told reporters.

In his first public comments after the crash, Putin appeared to hint there was no bad blood between him and Prigozhin.

But former Kremlin speechwriter turned political analyst Abbas Gallyamov said: 'Putin has demonstrated that if you fail to obey him without question, he will dispose of you without mercy, like an enemy, even if you are formally a patriot.'

However, Osechkin - founder of the Gulagu.net group which gathers testimony from prisoners and workers in Russia's notorious jails, is not convinced that Navalny was killed by any of the above methods.

He says that authorities would have been able to kill Navalny in any way they desired, and would not have wanted to 'leave a trace in his body and would lead directly back to Putin'.

He claims that Navalny had been forced to spend between two and a half to four hours in an open-air solitary confinement space where temperatures could dip to minus 27C the day before his death.

Prisoners are normally kept outdoors for no more than an hour and in far less extreme conditions.

'I think that they first destroyed his body by keeping him out in the cold for a long time and slowing the blood circulation down to a minimum,' Osechkin explained.

'And then it becomes very easy to kill someone, within seconds, if the operative has some experience in this.'

The single punch, an assassination technique reputedly used by KGB special forces to avoid leaving any indication of cause of death, is then said to have been used.

Before becoming Russian leader, Putin famously served for some 15 years in the KGB as a foreign intelligence officer, retiring in 1990 with the rank of lieutenant colonel.

Alexei Navalny was likely killed by a single punch to the heart, a technique used by the KGB, it has been claimed

Mr Navalny's family has been told that they cannot have access to his body for another two weeks.

Osechkin said that he believes the presence of FSB officers at the prison where Navanly died to be evidence that he was murdered by the Kremlin.

He added: 'From what I know from my sources, it was a special operation that had been prepared several days in advance.'

'It was a command from Moscow because without Moscow it would not have been possible to dismantle the cameras in the way that they did.'";True;1;0.5202962160110474;border_pos;0

The owner of the Maryland catering company that supplies meals to the National Guard protecting the US Capitol says he has nothing to hide after dozens of service members reportedly became sick from eating 'undercooked' food.

Phil Sardelis, the owner of Sardi's Catering invited DailyMail.com into his kitchen at the corporate headquarters in College Park to see how meals are prepared and precautions taken.

The visit comes after at least 50 soldiers reportedly became ill last week, with some even being hospitalized after consuming tainted food provided by the catering service.

'I'm not going to make any excuses, we made some mistakes and it's not acceptable,' Sardelis told DailyMail.com.

Sardelis said he has served more than 1.5million meals to soldiers and admitted approximately 100 of them were undercooked.

'I strive for perfection and for me one bad meal is unacceptable. I own it, it was our fault and we can only make sure it won't happen again.'

Sardelis' kitchen runs 24 hours a day seven days a week, serving 5,000 meals three times a day to soldiers, breakfast, lunch and dinner.

At one point he was putting out 60,000 meals a day when there were more soldiers deployed at the Capitol.

Food safety first: DailyMail.com observed food service workers packaging meals for the service members following last week's incident

Employees at the catering service checked the doneness of the meat by making sure it was above 140 degrees Fahrenheit

It comes after Sardi's came under fire last week for allegedly serving undercooked meat to members of the Michigan National Guard protecting the US Capitol. Members complained that they have been forced to eat raw chicken (pictured) moldy bread and meals containing metal shavings during their deployment

'When reports came back to us in mid-February there were some undercooked meals and metal shavings in the food, we got together with the National Guard and put further quality controls in place,' Sardelis said. 'Needless to say I wasn't happy about hearing this news.'

While Sardelis admits some meals may have been undercooked, he disputes the numbers that have been reported in the press.

'We serve dark meat, which is more flavorful and doesn't get overcooked as easily as white meat. When you cook dark meat it retains a greater percentage of myoglobin which converts to an iron form when cooked. This is where the pink color appears, it looks undercooked but actually is cooked.'

To illustrate this, Sardelis supplied a video of stewed meat that was taken out of a boiling pot, with a food thermometer that showed 170 degree temperature. The piece of meat was then pulled apart and it clearly showed some of the meat was pink, even though it was fully cooked.

Representatives of the National Guard come out to his kitchen every day and inspect and take the temperature of the cooked food to make sure it's up to standard.

'We randomly check the temperature of about 20 per cent of the food as it's being put into individual containers, just to make sure it's above 140 degrees.

Sardelis admitted that while some of the food was undercooked, it was only a fraction of the thousands of meals they serve daily

Sardelis said the cooked meals are put into a box and labeled with the time and temperature, with a four-hour disposal time

'The ""metal shavings"" that have been reported to be found in the chicken, may have come from a scouring pad, so we've removed them from our cooking area.'

But Sardelis said he's dumbfounded on how the metal pieces ended up on some of the chicken since they are cooked on a rotating spit.

While at the catering company, DailyMail.com observed employees taking the temperature of food at various stages of the packaging process, to make sure it's above 140 degrees Fahrenheit.

All of his employees wore masks and plastic disposable gloves when handling or near the food.

Sardelis said the cooked meals are put into a box and labeled with the time and temperature of the food with a four-hour disposal time.

The meals are then loaded onto a truck for the 20 miles journey to the DC Armory, where it's distributed to various National Guard troops.

Sardelis said if the food isn't consumed or refrigerated within a four-hour time frame that is written on the box, it's to be discarded.

'After it's dropped off at the DC Armory the food is out of our control,' added Sardelis.

Some of the dishes the troops can choose from include: Beef Bourguignon, spaghetti and meatballs, chicken cacciatore, salmon, cheeseburgers, penne rose, and chicken burrito bowls

Some of the dishes the troops can choose from include: Beef Bourguignon, spaghetti and meatballs, chicken cacciatore, salmon rose, cheeseburgers, penne rosa, and chicken burrito bowls.

'We've put out over a million meals to the soldiers. I think we've done a good job and supplied a good product. We are constantly trying to improve, there is always room for improvement.'

Sardelis who has an $11.4million dollar food contract with the National Guard that expires on March 15 says he would like to continue providing meals to the soldiers.

But it won't happen if Senator Gary Peters, a Democrat from Michigan and the 14 members of the Michigan House delegation have anything to say about it.

The lawmakers are calling for the service to terminate the contract with the company providing food to Michigan National Guard members in Washington D.C. and provide soldiers with a per diem instead.

A source told DailyMail.com that this per diem would amount to at least $76 per day, per soldier.

Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer released a statement saying Michigan National Guard members on deployment at the U.S. Capitol in Washington D.C. will come home after March 12 when the current mission is scheduled to end

Around 5,000 troops continue to guard the Capitol amid fears of a fresh siege as sources say there is intel of a militia plot to breach the Capitol on March 4

Last week it was reported that members of the Michigan National Guard complained they have been forced to eat raw chicken, moldy bread and meals containing metal shavings while they remain on guard in Washington DC protecting the US Capitol from attack.

They shared photos of pink chicken, uncooked beef and moldy food with lawmakers and online while one staff sergeant revealed dozens of meals had to be thrown out when metal shavings were found inside dishes.

But media relations officer with the National Guard Bureau of Public Affairs, Major Matt Murphy, and USAF told this DailyMail.com,

'Of the more than 1.2million meals served, approximately 50 soldiers have been treated for gastrointestinal complaints. Six of them were treated as outpatients at military treatment facilities; others were handled at aid station set up as part of the Task Force.

'In the event a Soldier or Airman feels they've received a meal where they deem something is wrong, it is discarded and they get a replacement. If they still have concerns, they have MREs (Meals Ready to Eat) available.

'The National Guard Bureau is continuing with the current food service contract and the vendor.'

Major Murphy also added that the complaints about the food came from guardsmen from two states including Michigan, but there have been no cases of foodborne illness reported, meaning there has been no proof that the undercooked food caused any issues with the soldiers.

The Michigan National Guard has approximately 1,000 out of the more than 5,000 soldiers who have been deployed to Washington, DC.

Last Thursday, Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer released a statement saying Michigan National Guard members on deployment at the U.S. Capitol in Washington D.C. will come home after March 12 when the current mission is scheduled to end.

Sardelis added that he received another report on Sunday that a member of the Michigan National Guard found a metal shaving on his donut that was in his meal for breakfast. He was later told it was a piece of aluminum foil.

He provided DailyMail.com with pictures on how he receives the donuts from a third party supplier. He doesn't know how a piece of 'metal' ended up on the outside of a donut.

Sardelis said he doesn't know what to say about the latest accusation.

'I have nothing hide, we provide a quality product,' said Sardelis.";True;1;0.5282702445983887;border_pos;0

Jamie Herrera Beutler for revealing Trump's call to McCarthy;"Marjorie Taylor Greene lashed out at fellow GOP Representative Jamie Herrera Beutler on Saturday for turning on the Republican Party, calling her 'the gift that keeps on giving to the Democrats.'

Taylor Greene is specifically referencing Herrera revealing details this week of a January 6 phone conversation between House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy and former president Doanld Trump.

'First voting to impeach innocent President Trump, then yapping to the press and throwing @GOPLeader under the bus, and now a tool as a witness for the Democrats running the circus trial,' Taylor Greene tweeted on Saturday. 'The Trump loyal 75 million are watching.'

Only 10 Republican congressmen and women voted to impeach Trump last month – exactly one week after the Capitol attack.

Taylor Greene, who famously was booted from her committee assignments earlier this month for pushing QAnon conspiracies, said the impeachment is a 'sham.'

'Another sham impeachment trial WITHOUT evidence is happening in the Senate,' Taylor Greene lamented on Twitter Saturday.

She instead, called for the impeachment of President Joe Biden.

'We should have a real impeachment in the House,' Taylor Greene said. 'Joe Biden is compromised by our enemies. Our national security is at stake.'

Marjorie Taylor Greene lashed out at fellow GOP Representative Jaime Herrera Beutler for first voting to impeach Donald Trump last month, and now revealing details of a call between the former president and House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy on January 6

'The gift that keeps on giving to Democrats': Greene says Herrera Beutler is acting as a 'tool' for Democrats in the impeachment against Trump

Herrera Beutler (pictured) told the press about McCarthy telling Trump about hearing gunshots outside the House chamber during a call between the two in the day of the Capitol storming

McCarthy reportedly briefed a number of GOP lawmakers on the call after the fact

Lead House impeachment manager Jamie Raskin piggy-backed off of a bombshell CNN report Friday which reveals details Herrera Beutler said she knew about a phone call between McCarthy and Trump on the day of the Capitol insurrection.

Raskin used that new information to make a surprise argument for calling witnesses as the fifth impeachment trial day kicked off Saturday morning.

The move to call witnesses was approved in a vote, along with support from five Republican, but Democrats quickly dropped the initiative after the GOP threatened to call more than 300 witnesses.

McCarthy told then-President Trump during a phone call in the midst of the Capitol storming on January 6 that he heard gunfire outside the House chamber.

ABC News' Jonathan Karl reported Saturday that McCarthy had made a specific reference to shots being fired as he encouraged Trump to call off the MAGA mob.

In particular, the impeachment prosecution team wanted to hear more from Herrera Beutler, who went public with what she knew about the call between McCarthy and Trump according to a briefing the GOP leader gave to lawmakers after the fact.

'For that reason and because this is the proper time to do so under the resolution the Senate adopted to set the rules for the trial we would like the opportunity to subpoena Congresswoman Herrera regarding her communications with the House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy and to subpoena her contemporaneous notes that she made regarding what President Trump told Kevin McCarthy in the middle of the insurrection,' Raskin told the Senate audience.

Jamie Raskin made the surprise announcement Saturday morning that the House Democratic impeachment managers wished to call witnesses, mainly Herrera Beutler

The House impeachment managers shared some of the CNN story sharing details of the call from Herrera's perspective

'We will be prepared to proceed by Zoom deposition of an hour or less just as soon as Congresswoman Herrera Beutler is available and to then proceed to the next phase of the trial, including the introduction of that testimony shortly thereafter,' he added.

The new twist to Trump's impeachment trial, which was expected to conclude Saturday, came after CNN reported Friday night new details about the call.

CNN said that Trump and McCarthy engaged in an expletive-laced shouting match during the riot, with the California Republican begging the president to rein in his supporters.

'Well, Kevin, I guess these people are more upset about the election than you are,' Trump said, according to lawmakers who were briefed on the call by McCarthy.

McCarthy, who was described by CNN as 'furious,' yelled at Trump that the rioters were breaking his windows.

'Who the f**k do you think you are talking to?' the top House Republican yelled at the president of the United States.

CNN's sources were Republican members of Congress, who believed that the contents of the call prove that Trump had no interest in calling off the deadly riot.

'He is not a blameless observer, he was rooting for them,' one GOP unnamed lawmaker said. 'On January 13, Kevin McCarthy said on the floor of the House that the President bears responsibility and he does.'

'This proves that the president knew very early on - what the mob was doing, and he knew members were at risk and he refused to act ... it's a violation of his oath of office to fail to come to this defense of Congress and the constitutional process immediately,' another GOP member familiar with the call told CNN.

Herrera Beutler, a Washington state Republican who voted in favor of Trump's impeachment, mentioned Trump's comments to McCarthy during a town hall this week.

She later confirmed the exchange to CNN.

'You have to look at what he did during the insurrection to confirm where his mind was at,' Herrera Beutler said. 'That line right there demonstrates to me that either he didn't care, which is impeachable, because you cannot allow an attack on your soil, or he wanted it to happen and was OK with it, which makes me so angry.'

'We should never stand for that, for any reason, under any party flag,' the lawmaker continued. 'I'm trying really hard not to say the F-word.'

And she again stood by her account in a Twitter statement on Friday evening.

She wrote: When McCarthy finally reached the President on January 6 and asked him to publicly and forcefully call off the riot, the president initially repeated the falsehood that it was antifa that had breached the Capitol. McCarthy refuted that and told the president that these were Trump supporters. That's when, according to McCarthy, the president said: 'well I guess these people are more upset about the election than you are.'

'To the patriots who were standing next to the former president as these conversations were happening, or even to the former vice president: if you have something to add here now would be the time.'

Rep. Anthony Gonzalez, an Ohio Republican who voted to impeach Trump, told CNN that he believes the exchange 'speaks to the former President's mindset.'

'He was not sorry to see his unyieldingly loyal vice president or the Congress under attack by the mob he inspired. In fact, it seems he was happy about it or at the least enjoyed the scenes that were horrifying to most Americans across the country,' Gonzalez said.

During Friday's impeachment trial, Trump's lawyers tried to deny the president even knew that individuals like Vice President Mike Pence were in peril.

'The answer is no. At no point was the president informed the vice president was in any danger,' Trump's attorney Bruce Castor said, despite Republican Sen. Tommy Tuberville of Alabama saying that on a call he had with Trump during the insurrection he mentioned that Pence was being whisked away to a secure location.

After Friday's proceedings, Tuberville told reporters he stood by his account.

In Virginia, Republican voters will select nominees to challenge two vulnerable Democratic U.S. representatives, Elaine Luria and Abigail Spanberger, in the Nov. 8 midterm elections.

Republicans are favored to win control of the House of Representatives -- and need to flip only five Democratic seats to do so -- and could also capture the Senate, as Democratic President Joe Biden's approval ratings have soured amid surging inflation.

A Republican-controlled House could stymie much of Biden's agenda while launching politically damaging investigations into his administration.

Former President Donald Trump pulled back his endorsement from GOP Rep. Mo Brooks in the Alabama Senate primary after he called on people to put 2020 behind them

In Alabama, Britt and Brooks are seeking to succeed the retiring Republican Senator Richard Shelby. Britt is Shelby's former chief of staff and led a group that represents businesses in the state, while Brooks has served 12 years in the House.

The two advanced to a runoff contest after finishing first and second, respectively, ahead of a third candidate in May.

Trump initially backed Brooks, a staunch ally who has echoed his false claims that the 2020 presidential election was fraudulent, and criticized Britt as ""unqualified."" Brooks delivered a fiery speech to Trump supporters in Washington on Jan. 6, 2021, before some of them stormed the Capitol seeking to prevent the certification of Biden's victory.

But Trump rescinded his endorsement three months ago, after Brooks at a rally with Trump urged Republicans to put 2020 behind them.

Brooks has been a fervent Trump loyalist but infuriated the former president when he called for people to look beyond 2020

Trump threw his endorsement to Republican Senate candidate Katie Britt

Ten days before Tuesday's election, Trump endorsed Britt, who has out-spent Brooks and led in recent polls.

Trump, who is weighing another White House run in 2024, has endorsed some 200 candidates so far in 2022, with mixed results in competitive races in states including Georgia, Ohio and Pennsylvania.

Tuesday's winner will be heavily favored in November against the Democratic nominee, minister Will Boyd.

VIRGINIA RACES

In Virginia, Republicans' statewide success in 2021, headlined by Governor Glenn Youngkin's victory, has given them confidence they can flip two Democratic-held seats.

Luria, a former Navy officer, and Spanberger, a former CIA counter-terrorism officer, both won Republican-held seats in 2018, when Democrats captured a majority in the House. But they are seen as vulnerable in November given the national political environment favoring Republicans.

Luria is a member of the Jan. 6 House committee that has been holding a series of high-profile televised hearings aimed at examining Trump's role in the Capitol riot.

The four Republicans vying for her seat include state Senator Jen Kiggans, also a Navy veteran who has the support of Republican House leaders, and hard-right candidate Jarome Bell, another Navy veteran who has repeated Trump's claims about voter fraud.

There are half a dozen Republicans running for the chance to take on Spanberger, led by state Senator Bryce Reeves, an Army veteran. Other candidates include Derrick Anderson, an Army Special Forces veteran who has never run for office before but has shown strong fundraising, and Yesli Vega, an auxiliary deputy sheriff endorsed by U.S. Senator Ted Cruz.

Trump has not endorsed anyone in either race, though the candidates have sought to position themselves as his supporters.";True;1;0.5824825763702393;border_pos;0

'It is great to be back with so many patriots. Dedicated to faith and freedom and the road to the majority,' Pence had said.

As he began thanking Ralph Reed, the head of the Faith & Freedom coalition, he was met with boos and people loudly shouting 'traitor!'

But speaking to Fox's Brian Kilmeade, McCarthy said: 'Mike Pence is not a traitor'.

McCarthy continued, 'Mike Pence served as not only as a member of Congress [during] which I served with him, one of the most conservative members.

He went on to tout Pence's political record, including the push during the Trump administration to fill court benches with conservative judges, including the Supreme Court.

'He was the governor of Indiana. And he was the vice president, stood right by President Trump, helped him get through the tax reform, get those judges in. Mike Pence deserves a lot of credit.'

Minority Leader McCarthy was a key Trump ally amid a fracture between the former president and his VP.

The Road to Majority conference attracted a number of conservative household names including Sens. Ted Cruz, Marco Rubio, Ron Johnson, Rick Scott, Marsha Blackburn, Lindsey Graham and House Minority Whip Steve Scalise.

And they pushed a number of right-wing talking points with Cruz, for example, remarking that 'critical race theory is bigoted. It is a lie, And it is every bit as racist as the Klansmen in white sheets.'

Cruz also said: 'I'm going to commit a radical act, I'm going to speak the truth. America is great. Christopher Columbus discovering America was a good thing. George Washington was an American hero. Thomas Jefferson was an American hero. Abraham Lincoln was an American hero.

He also lambasted the days when you could say 'Israel is our friend, boys and girls are different and the Wuhan virus came from Wuhan' without the 'fear of getting cancelled'

Audience members booed and shouted 'traitor' at former Vice President Mike Pence at an event in Orlando, Florida Friday

Pence barely introduced himself before the audience rebelled.

'And I want to thank my friend Ralph Reed for those overly generous words, I'm deeply humbled by them,' Pence said.

'Ralph Reed knows me well enough to know the introduction I prefer is a little bit shorter: I'm a Christian, a conservative and a Republican, and I'm honored to stand before you today,' he continued, as the shouts also continued.

In the lead-up to the January 6 MAGA riot, former President Donald Trump pushed Pence, who had a Constitutional duty to preside over Congress' counting of Electoral College votes, to throw out votes from key swing states - in an effort to overturn President Joe Biden's win.

'I hope Mike is going to do the right thing. I hope so. I hope so,' Trump told the crowd at the Ellipse on the morning of January 6, before droves of them stormed the Capitol. 'Because if Mike Pence does the right thing, we win the election.'

Trump falsely claimed to the crowd that Pence had 'the absolute right' to toss out Electoral Votes at his choosing.

Pence publicly said he didn't see it that way.

When rioters got to the Capitol later on January 6, some chanted 'hang Mike Pence' for his refusal to do Trump's bidding.

During Trump's second impeachment hearing, video footage showed Pence narrowly escaping from the crowd.

Trump never called to check in on him.

Earlier this month, Pence tried to push that he was still on Trump's good side telling an audience at the Lincoln-Reagan Dinner in Manchester, New Hampshire that he'd spoken to Trump 'many times' since they left office.

The reaction to Pence comes five months after he refused to overturn the electoral college votes that ratified Biden's win

Sen. Ted Cruz spoke to the crowd Friday at the Road to Majority conference in Orlando, Florida. He said that critical race theory being promoted in some schools is 'as racist as Klansmen'

He admitted, however, that they do not 'see eye-to-eye' on the January 6 insurrection.

'But I will always be proud of what we accomplished for the American people over the last four years,' Pence said. 'And I will not allow Democrats or their allies in the media to use one tragic day to discredit the aspirations of millions of Americans,' he added.

He told the audience that he 'learned a lot serving alongside President Donald Trump.'

'Some people think we're a little bit different,' the ex-veep said. 'But I think what President Trump showed us was what Republicans can accomplish when our leaders stand firm on conservative principles and don't back down.'

'It was four years of consequence, four years of results,' Pence said. 'It was four years of promises made and promises kept.'";True;1;0.7104195952415466;border_pos;0

He is being held without bail and faces life in prison. He is due back in court on Thursday

A teenaged gunman who allegedly murdered 10 people at a Buffalo supermarket planned the attack for months before he drove for three hours to carry out the vile ambush that authorities are calling an act of 'violent extremism' motivated by race.

Federal agents interviewed the parents of Payton Gendron, the teenager accused of firing a barrage of 50 shots at the store that killed 10 people, a law enforcement official said on Sunday.

Gendron, 18, of Conklin, NY, pleaded not guilty to first-degree murder following Saturday's attack. He is being held without bail and faces life in prison.

The alleged killer, who is due back in court on Thursday, is currently on suicide watch and is being held in a separate unit from other inmates, the sheriff of Erie County, John Garcia, said at the news conference Sunday.

Gendron's parents Paul and Pamela were cooperating with investigators, the official - who asked to remain anonymous - said.

Police said Sunday that they believe the attack had been planned for months and added that they are investigating a 180-page manifesto that Gendron reportedly posted before going on his rampage that included a plan to drive several counties away to carry out the shooting at the Tops Friendly Market.

Gendron identified himself as a white supremacist in the document as he explained his fears white people are being replaced by other races, police said.

'The shooter traveled hours from outside this community to perpetrate this crime on the people of Buffalo, a day when people were enjoying the sunshine, enjoying family, enjoying friends,' Buffalo Mayor Byron Brown said at a Saturday evening news conference.

'People in a supermarket, shopping and bullets raining down on them. People's lives being snuffed out in an instant for no reason.'

Seven of of the victims have been named by family members by Sunday, including security guard Aaron Salter - a retired Buffalo police officer - who fired multiple shots at Gendron. A bullet hit the gunman's armor, but had no effect. Gendron then killed Salter, before hunting more victims.

Shopper Ruth Whitfield, an 86-year-old grandmother, who is also the mother of former Buffalo fire commissioner Garnell Whitfield, and Katherine Massey, who had gone to the store to pick up some groceries, were also was killed, according to Buffalo News.

Pearly Young, 77, who fed needy residents in Buffalo's Central Park neighborhood for 25 years, was shot and killed during the massacre, reporter Madison Carter tweeted.

Celestine Chaney, 65, who was at the supermarket to buy strawberries for shortcake, was killed during the shooting, her son, Wayne Jones, 48, confirmed. Roberta Drury, 32, was at the store to buy groceries for dinner when she was fatally shot, her sister Amanda Drury, 34, said.

Heyward Patterson, who would often give people rides to and from the supermarket and help them carry their groceries, was also among the 10 people fatally shot, according to Patterson's great niece Teniqua Clark.

Officials said the rifle Gendron used in the attack was purchased legally but the magazines he used for ammunition were not allowed to be sold in New York.

Robert Donald, the owner of Vintage Firearms in Endicott, N.Y., told the New York Times on Sunday that he recently sold a Bushmaster assault weapon to the man accused of the massacre.

Donald, 75, who primarily sells collectible firearms, said the teen bought the gun without leaving an impression and was shocked when he got a call from investigators regarding Gendron.

Police say the rambling text of a 180-page manifesto that Payton Gendron (pictured here) posted included a plan of the attack which detailed driving several counties away to carry out the rampage the Tops Friendly Market

A preliminary investigation found Gendron had repeatedly visited sites espousing white supremacist ideologies and race-based conspiracy theories and extensively researched the 2019 mosque shootings in Christchurch, New Zealand, and the man who killed dozens at a summer camp in Norway in 2011, the official said.

It wasn't immediately clear why Gendron had traveled about 200 miles from his Conklin, New York, to Buffalo and that particular grocery store, but investigators believe Gendron had specifically researched the demographics of the population around the Tops Friendly Markey and had been searching for communities with a high number of African American residents, the official said. The market is located in a predominantly black neighborhood.

Police said Gendron, wearing military gear and livestreaming with a helmet camera, shot, in total, 11 Black people and two white people Saturday in a rampage that the 18-year-old broadcast live before surrendering to authorities. Screenshots purporting to be from the Twitch broadcast appear to show a racial epithet scrawled on the rifle used in the attack, as well as the number 14, a likely reference to a white supremacist slogan.

Buffalo Mayor Byron Brown told churchgoers he saw former Buffalo fire commissioner Garnell Whitfield, the son of victim Ruth Whitfield at the shooting scene Saturday, looking for his mother.

'My mother had just gone to see my father, as she does every day, in the nursing home and stopped at the Tops to buy just a few groceries.

'And nobody has heard from her,' Whitfield told the mayor then. She was confirmed as a victim later in the day, Brown said.

Pearly Young, 77, a beloved grandmother and former missionary was mourned on social media Sunday. 'For 25 years she ran a pantry where every Saturday she fed people in Central Park. Every. Saturday.

'She loved singing, dancing, & being with family. She was mother, grandma, & missionary. Gone too soon,' reporter Madison Carter wrote in a tweet.

'YOU DID NOT DESERVE THIS!!!!' Jimmie Smith posted on Facebook with a picture of Young.

Chaney, 65, a breast cancer survivor, was visiting her sister and the two of them were at the supermarket Saturday because Chaney wanted to get strawberries to make shortcake.

'She loved those,' her son told the Times, who explained that her sister made it into the freezer, 'but my mom cannot really walk like she used to... she basically can't run.'

Drury, 32, who was killed in the shooting while she was shopping for dinner, was described as 'very vibrant' by her sister Amanda. 'She always was the center of attention and made the whole room smile and laugh.'

The shooting also claimed the life of Heyward Patterson, a deacon at State Tabernacle COGIC, who was known to give people rides to and from the Tops supermarket and help them carry their groceries, according to Patterson's great niece Teniqua Clark.

Federal agents interviewed the parents of Payton Gendron, the teenager accused of firing a barrage of 50 shots at the supermarket that killed 10 people, a law enforcement official said on Sunday

Erie County Sheriff John Garcia expressly called the shooting a hate crime. 'This was pure evil,' Garcia said. Twitch said in a statement that it ended Gendron's transmission 'less than two minutes after the violence started.'

The Mass Shooting further unsettled a nation wracked with racial tensions, gun violence and a spate of hate crimes. A day before, Dallas police had said they were investigating shootings in the city's Koreatown as hate crimes.

The Buffalo attack came just a month after a shooting on a Brooklyn subway wounded 10 and just over a year after 10 were killed in a shooting at a Colorado supermarket.

President Joe Biden gave an impassioned plea during the vigil Sunday asking Americans to 'address the hate that remains a stain on the soul of America' after a racially motivated gunman opened fire at a supermarket in Buffalo.

'A lone gunman, armed with weapons of war and a hate-filled soul shot and killed 10 innocent people in cold blood in a grocery store Saturday afternoon,' Biden said during the 41st Annual National Peace Officers' Memorial Service outside the Capitol on Sunday.

The president said that while the Justice Department investigates the crime in Buffalo 'we must all work together to address the hate that remains a stain on the soul of America.'

The speech in D.C. came less than 24 hours after Gendron livestreamed his racially motivated mass shooting on Twitch at a Tops grocery store in Buffalo.

Gendron, who was confronted by police in the store's vestibule following the shooting, put a rifle to his neck but was convinced to drop it. He was arraigned later Saturday on a murder charge, appearing before a judge in a paper gown.

A witness to the shooting recalls the the horrifying moments that unfolded when she saw the gunman began firing at people in the parking lot at the supermarket across from her home on Saturday.

Katherine Crofton, a retired firefighter, told the New York Post she heard the first shot and when she turned around and 'saw him shoot the guy and the lady.'

Crofton said she then 'immediately heard a shot,' and realized 'hero' supermarket security guard Aaron Salter Jr. had been fatally shot because of the continued gunfire.

'I knew Aaron was dead because he kept going,' she said. She described him as a 'good security guard,' who 'didn't take no sh-t.' Crofton said the rampage continued.

'You hear him walk into the store shooting people, just, 'pop, pop, pop,' Crofton recalled. 'He was in full combat gear – helmet, body armor, everything. He was loaded.'

When the gunman walked back out of the store, Crofton said she remembers the look on this face. 'His face was just blank. There was no expression on his face,' she said. 'It was just blank.'

Gendron was arrested Saturday after allegedly killing 10 people at a Tops Market supermarket in Buffalo, Upstate New York. Police say the massacre was motivated by the 18 year-old's hatred for black people

The Tops supermarket released a statement on Sunday morning, according to NewsChannel9.

The Tops supermarket released a statement on Sunday morning, according to News9.

The statement reads: 'The Tops family is heartbroken over the senseless violence that impacted associates and customers at our store on Jefferson Avenue.

'We are working quickly to make sure that all of our associates have access to counseling and support that they may need.

'Tops has been committed to this community and the city of Buffalo for decades and this tragedy will not change that commitment.

'We are working to find alternatives for our customers in this community while our store is closed and will provide updates in the near future.'

The victims killed in the shooting were remembered in a vigil service at True Bethel Baptist Church in Buffalo on Sunday morning.

As True Bethel's Darius Pridgen spoke, 'someone rushed in and caused a disturbance, appeared to yell 'put down the gun,' Jon Harris with Buffalo News tweeted. 'They rushed him out and said, 'not today.' 'Don't hurt him, just get him the help he needs,' Pridgen said.

'Before that, Pridgen said a man named Charles, who is singing today at True Bethel, was at the hospital yesterday after his grandson was among those shot,' he tweeted.

In another tweet, Harris said, 'Pridgen said he's been getting calls, saying the 18 year old shooter's brain wasn't fully developed.

'His brain was developed enough to write an entire manifesto,' he said, noting he cares more about the mental health of those who lost a loved one yesterday.'

President Joe Biden condemned the Buffalo mass shooting as an act by 'a lone gunman, armed with weapons of war and a hate-filled soul' during an event honoring law enforcement officers who died in the line of duty in the last year

At the vigil Sunday at True Bethel Baptist Church, Gov. Kathy Hochul spoke about standing up to racism and ensure that a shooting like the one on Saturday never happens again.

'It's been a hard 24 hours. Our hearts are broken. ... Lord, forgive the anger in my heart right now,' she said.

'I want people to talk about Buffalo as the last place this ever happened,' Hochul continued. 'An attack on one of us is an attack on all of us, because we are all God's people.'

Officials at the Susquehanna Valley High School brought in New York State Police to investigate Gendron in June of 2021 after he made statements that he would shoot fellow students.

A year later he ended up shooting 13 people - 10 of them fatally - during an attack motivated by his hatred for black people at a Top Market supermarket in Buffalo.

'A school official reported that this very troubled young man had made statements indicating that he wanted to do a shooting, either at a graduation ceremony, or sometime after,' a government source told the Buffalo News.

After police looked into the account, Gendron was referred for mental health evaluation and counseling.

Classmates said that he often acted strangely at times and espoused extremist views on politics.

Last year, one former student recalled, Gendron wore a hazmat suit to school for a week. She believed it had something to do with protecting himself from the coronavirus, but she didn't rule out the fact that he was making a joke.

'It was the most extra thing that I ever saw him do,' a former classmate who asked not to be named said.

There were other indications of Gendron's fragile mental state.

During a class exercise in political class in which the students created their own countries with the government of their choice, Gendron's pick was an autocratic regime that the classmate described as 'Hitler-esque.'

'His views were extreme,' the student said. 'You could pick any form of government that you wanted and he picked a totalitarian government.'

The gunman opened fire around 2.30pm on Saturday while livestreaming the shooting

Bystanders and shoppers gathered outside the supermarket where the shooting took place

The classmate recalled that he almost collided with her head on in his car, but she brushed it off at the time to careless driving.

'He was definitely into video games - shooter games,' she said.

'It's so mind-blowing to think that it could have been us,' she said. 'I know he had his manifesto, but what if he decided to do a test run on us.'

For the most part he was quiet, but she said he would 'smile weirdly' when he spoke to people. She said she didn't remember him every having a girlfriend.

Gendron is one of four boys born to Paul and Pamela Gendron, two civil engineers with the state who live in Conklin, NY, three and half hours south of Buffalo. Paul coached his kids in the town soccer league and at least one neighbor found him 'strange.' His mother appeared conceited, locals said.

'He's from this pristine family,' a schoolmate said. 'They have everything together, they were just perfect.'

In photos posted by his mother on Facebook, Payton Gendron appears to tower over his father and others.

'He was 6'1' or 6'2'' his schoolmate said. 'He was a big guy.'

The family appears to be a tight-knit suburban family that played LaserTag together, when to Autumn festivals, the beach and dined together in restaurants. Neighbors said they were odd.

'To be honest, the mother was kind of snooty,' a local parent who asked not to be named said. 'Like she was better than everyone else. The father was strange. Like when you meet someone and they just seem off.'

A neighbor recalled him bringing home a human-sized Brontosaurus that he build for a school project. School records show that he was a good student and made high honors in his senior year, scoring higher than 92 percent in all his classes.

Facebook photos show that Gendron went on a few college tours and spent some time enrolled in Broome County Community College. A college spokeswoman told he Buffalo News that he was no longer enrolled.

'They have a really nice family,' neighbor Nancy Santucci said. 'They seem like regular people. In a million years I never would think that anyone from this neighborhood would drive to Buffalo to carry out a racially motivated shooting.'

'I'm just shocked,' she said.

Buffalo police department responded to the scene of a mass shooting that left 10 people dead and three wounded

The young man posted a 180-page manifesto online before the shooting espousing the paranoid white supremacist views that whites were being replaced in American by people of color.

In the screed, he says that he was radicalize by 4Chan, the same online chat group that launched Qanon. He claims that critical race theory is a Jewish plot to undermine white which he argues is a reason to kill Jews.

He also refers to other mass shootings carried out to further racist ideology like Dylan Roof, who who killed nine people in a black church in South Carolina and New Zealand lunatic Brenton Tarrant, who murdered 51 people in mosque.

Gendron also espoused the 'great replacement theory', which claims Democrats are deliberately importing illegal migrants into the US wholesale to achieve electoral dominance while driving whites to extinction.

On Saturday night, Gendron who was barefoot, masked and wearing a paper smock, told the judge that he understood the charge against and was not guilty at an arraignment Saturday evening.

He has only been charged with one count of first-degree murder. Erie County District Attorney John Flynn said the judge ordered a forensic examination and ordered him held without bail.

'We have taken the necessary steps to get him behind bars,' he said. 'That was justice. Getting that first murder charge filed immediately.'

The suspected gunman, seen here, killed ten people and wounded three others in a Buffalo supermarket

The DA said that they are working with federal authorities to bring further terrorism, hate crime and murder charges.

He made no other comment, and Gendron's lawyer confirmed he planned to plead not guilty to the killings. Conklin has since been pictured in social media profiles.

Hours earlier Gendron was caught by police emerging from the Tops Friendly Supermarket, at 1275 Jefferson Avenue about 2.30pm after shooting 13 people, 10 fatally.

Survivors have since told of how they fled to the supermarket's freezer in terror. And operations manager Shonnell Harris told of how she fled out the back of the shop to what she hoped was safety - only to see Gendron gun down a victim in front of her.

Police said 11 of those shot were black, with the other two white, and suggested Gendron had walked through the supermarket looking for specific people to target, although didn't say whether this was based on the color of their skin.

Aaron Salter Jr, a former Buffalo police officer, is the first victim that's been named in the attack. The father of three is being hailed as a hero after exchanging gunfire with Gendron inside the market.

Gendron apparently scrawled the n-word on his rifle before carrying out Saturday's massacre at Tops Friendly Supermarket in Buffalo.

Gendron lived-streamed the assault as he opened fire inside the Tops Friendly Supermarket, at 1275 Jefferson Avenue, at about 2.30pm.

Police described the incident as a 'heavily armed' attack.

'He exited his vehicle. He was very heavily armed. He had tactical gear. He had a tactical helmet on. He had a camera that he was livestreaming what he was doing,' city Police Commissioner Joseph Gramaglia said at a news conference.

Gendron shot four people outside the store, three fatally, the commissioner said. He then went into the supermarket where he exchanged gunfire with Salter. The ex-cop shot at him multiple times but the bullets hit the shooter's body arm and left him unfazed, the commissioner said.

Gendron then killed Salter.

A further six victims are believed to have been shot dead inside.

Salter's son, Aaron Salter Jr., hailed his father for trying to stop the maniac gunman.

'Today is a shock,' he told the Daily Beast. 'I'm pretty sure he saved some lives today. He's a hero.'

The killings were broadcast live on streaming site Twitch, although the clip was removed within two minutes of its posting.

Ruth Whitfield, the 86-year-old mother of retired Buffalo fire commissioner Garnell W. Witfield, was also killed during the shooting spree.

'My mom was the consummate mom. mother was a mother to the motherless. She was a blessing to all of us. She loved God and taught us to do the same thing,' the former commissioner told the Buffalo News.

New York Governor Kathy Hochul blasted Gendron's 'demented' killings and called for a crackdown on social media firms, who she said effectively acted as an 'accomplice' by letting mass-shooters like Gendron glorify their crimes.

President Joe Biden expressed his condolences to the families who lost loved-ones in the attack and denounced the white supremacy as 'repugnant.'

'Tonight, we grieve for the families of ten people whose lives were senselessly taken and everyone who is suffering the physical and emotional wounds of this horrific shooting,' Biden said. 'A racially motivated hate crime is abhorrent to the very fabric of this nation. Any act of domestic terrorism, including an act perpetrated in the name of a repugnant white nationalist ideology, is antithetical to everything we stand for in America. Hate must have no safe harbor. We must do everything in our power to end hate-fueled domestic terrorism.'

'This was pure evil, it was straight up a racially motivated hate crime,' the Erie County Sheriff John Garcia said.

'This is the worst nightmare that any community can face, and we are hurting and we are seething right now,' Buffalo Mayor Byron Brown said at a news conference. 'The depth of pain that families are feeling and that all of us are feeling right now cannot even be explained.'

The shooting took place on Saturday at the Tops supermarket (pictured) at 1275 Jefferson Avenue, in Buffalo, New York. At least 10 people were shot

Buffalo gunman, 18, 'had name of a Waukesha Parade victim on his rifle when he murdered 10 in racist attack' six months after five died when SUV sped through crowd in Wisconsin The gunman who killed 10 people in a racist attack at an upstate New York grocery store appears to have had the name of a white woman who was run over at a Christmas parade in Wisconsin last year scrawled on his gun. Photos of the rifle used by Payton Gendron, 18, in the live-streamed massacre show the misspelled name of Virginia Sorenson. Sorenson, 79, was at the Waukesha Christmas to perform as part of the 'Dancing Grannies' troupe when a man in an SUV plowed into the crowd, killing her and five others. The assailant in the November attack, Darrell Edward Brooks, is a black man who had shared social media posts promoting Black Lives Matter and violence toward white people. Gendron shot a total of 13 people at the Tops Friendly Supermarket in Buffalo at about 2.30pm on Saturday. The teenager, described as an outcast with extreme views, had a 180-page manifesto that focused on the 'great replacement theory,' which holds that whites are being deliberately outnumbered in the US by immigrants to skew elections in favor of Democrats. Buffalo police did not respond to questions about the writing on the gun, the Daily Beast reports. Photos of the rifle used in the shooting appear to show Virginia Sorenson's misspelled name along with the N-word written across the barrel. Sorenson was killed on November 21 during the Waukesha Christmas parade attack. She was one of four members of the 'Dancing Grannies' that were mowed down by Darrell Brooks, who had espoused his own controversial views about race. In a Facebook post from June 9, 2020, Brooks wrote: 'LEARNED ND TAUGHT BEHAVIOR!! so when we start bakk knokkin white people TF out ion wanna hear it...the old white ppl 2, KNOKK DEM TF OUT!! PERIOD..' followed by a middle finger and expletive emoji. The post was among several that emerged in the wake of his arrest after he drove his red Ford SUV in a crowd of kids and elderly dancing groups during the parade in the Milwaukee suburb. Waukesha police later determined that Brooks had not planned the attack and that he did not seek to target any specific ethnic or racial group. He is awaiting trial on 77 total charges, including six counts of first-degree intentional homicide. On Saturday evening, Payton Gendron pled not guilty to one count of first degree murder for his supermarket rampage that killed 10 people. Gendron, of Conklin, New York, was barefoot, masked and wearing a paper smock. He told the judge that he understood the charge against and was not guilty at his arraignment. He has only been charged with one count of first-degree murder. Erie County District Attorney John Flynn said the judge ordered a forensic examination and ordered him held without bail. 'We have taken the necessary steps to get him behind bars,' he said. 'That was justice. Getting that first murder charge filed immediately.' The DA said that they are working with federal authorities to bring further terrorism, hate crime and murder charges. Gendron's 180-page Google Drive document detailed his twisted reasons for carrying out Saturday's massacre at the Top Market supermarket. A large part of the manifesto focused on the 'great replacement theory.' Gendron said he'd chosen to target the upstate New York store because it sat in the zip code 14208, which he said 'has the highest black percentage that is close to where I live.' He included a rudimentary map of the store, but didn't name it prior to the shooting, saying he didn't want to tip anyone off should his manifesto end up in the hands of law enforcement. The manifesto said that he'd been radicalized entirely by the internet - rather than anyone he'd met in real life - and added that he'd been inspired by Brenton Tarrant. Tarrant is a white supremacist who live-streamed himself murdering 51 Muslims at a mosque in Christchurch, New Zealand, in 2019. Gendron said: 'The truth is my personal life and experiences are of no value.' Gendron said Tarrant 'radicalized him the most' while discussing what had spurred him to shoot 13 people, 10 of them fatally. Also named as an inspiration in the manifesto was white supremacist mass-murderer Dylann Roof, who killed nine black worshippers at a South Carolina church in 2015. And Norwegian killer Anders Breivik – who massacred 77 people in 2011 – was also cited as an inspiration by Gendron. The Google Document that contained Gendron's manifesto remained online for several hours. It was later taken down after Google said its contents had violated the web giant's terms of service. Screen grabs of its contents remain online. The gunman discussed his hatred of blacks, Jews, left-wing people and transgender people. He also offered biographical detail of his mundane life, saying he'd grown up in Conklin, New York, around three-and-a-half-hours away from Buffalo. Gendron added: 'I was never diagnosed with a mental disability or disorder,' he wrote. I believe to be perfectly sane.' The troubled teenager had threatened to shoot up his high school graduation last year, according to school officials. Officials at the Susquehanna Valley High School brought in New York State Police to investigate Gendron last June, after he made statements that he would shoot fellow students. 'A school official reported that this very troubled young man had made statements indicating that he wanted to do a shooting, either at a graduation ceremony, or sometime after,' a government source told the Buffalo News.

The young man drove hours from the white suburban town of Conklin, just outside Binghamton, to the scene of the massacre.

As the shooting unfolded, Gramaglia said, Buffalo police charged into the store and confronted the gunman in the vestibule.

'At that point the suspect put the gun to his own neck. Buffalo police personnel - two patrol officers - talked the suspect into dropping the gun. He dropped the gun, took off some of his tactical gear, surrendered at that point. And he was led outside, put in a police car,' he said.

The video of the arrest seen by DailyMail.com shows police cuffing the suspect and trying to get people away from the scene as several bodies lie motionless on the ground.

'A shooter, it's a mass shooter type s***,' one of the onlookers says as police and emergency responders detain the man in the military uniform.

'Damn, look at him, a young boy,' the onlooker adds as he comments on one of the bodies.

Police then instruct the onlookers to back up as they take control of the situation.

Hours after the shooting, Erica Pugh-Mathews waited outside the police tape wondering what happened to family members who were inside the store.

'We would like to know the status of my aunt, my mother's sister. She was in there with her fiance, they separated and went to different aisles,' she said. 'A bullet barely missed him. He was able to hide in a freezer but he was not able to get to my aunt and does not know where she is. We just would like word either way if she's OK.'

Officials speaking under the condition of anonymity cautioned the investigation was in its preliminary stages and that authorities hadn't yet discerned a clear motive, but they are looking into racial animus a possibility.

The FBI is investigating the spree as a hate crime and a 'case of racially motivated violent extremism,' Special Agent in Charge of the Buffalo field office Stephen Blodgett told the New York Times. The U.S. Attorney for the Western District of New York will also investigate the case. But he was not on their radar previously.

Buffalo supermarket shooter's chilling 180-page manifesto said 'great replacement theory' of whites being outnumbered drove him to kill - and New Zealand mosque shooter Brenton Tarrant was his inspiration The Buffalo supermarket killer says he was driven to kill by the 'great replacement theory' which claims white people are being driven to extinction by migrants. Payton Gendron's 180 page Google Drive document detailed his twisted reasons for carrying out Saturday's massacre at the Top Market supermarket, killing 10. A large part of the manifesto focused on the 'great replacement theory'. IT claims whites are being deliberately outnumbered in the US by migrants from other countries to skew elections in favor of the Democrats. Gendron said he'd chosen to target the upstate New York store because it sat in the zip code 14208, which he said 'has the highest black percentage that is close to where I live.' He included a rudimentary map of the store, but didn't name it prior to the shooting, saying he didn't want to tip anyone off should his manifesto end up in the hands of law enforcement. The manifesto said that he'd been radicalized entirely by the internet - rather than anyone he'd met in real life - and added that he'd been inspired by Brenton Tarrant. Tarrant is a white supremacist who live-streamed himself murdering 51 Muslims at a mosque in Christchurch, New Zealand, in 2019. Gendron said: 'The truth is my personal life and experiences are of no value.' Gendron said Tarrant 'radicalized him the most' while discussing what had spurred him to shoot 13 people, 10 of them fatally. Also named as an inspiration in the manifesto was white supremacist mass-murderer Dylann Roof, who killed nine black worshippers at a South Carolina church in 2015. And Norwegian killer Anders Breivik – who massacred 77 people in 2011 – was also cited as an inspiration by Gendron. Police said 11 of the people he shot were black, with the other two white. Like Tarrant, Gendron live-streamed his massacre. Tarrant used Facebook Live, while Gendron used streaming service Twitch. It is most popular among video gamers, with Twitch removing Gendron's video less than two minutes after it was uploaded. A Twitch spokesman said they were 'devastated' that their platform had been used. The Google Document that contained Gendron's manifesto remained online for several hours. It was later taken down after Google said its contents had violated the web giant's terms of service. Screen grabs of its contents remain online. They also include hundreds of racist memes, and grabs of liberal publications Gendron deemed offensive to his believes. And although the manifesto is widely-believed to be authentic, with Gendron identifying himself, he used a fake photograph. The snap he uploaded, which he claimed was him, was actually of comedian Sam Hyde. That image of Hyde - posing outdoors while holding an assault rifle - has been repeatedly used to falsely identify other mass-shooters. It is unclear if Gendron used Hyde's image in his own manifesto in a twisted attempt at humor. So far two victims have been identified, both of whom are black. Grandmother Ruth Whitfield, 86, was gunned down while shopping for eggs. And store security guard Aaron Salter, a father of three, was killed after opening fire on Gendron. Salter did so after seeing Gendron shoot other shoppers dead, but the teenage killer had worn enough body armor to protect himself from Salter's bullets. Gendron discussed his hatred of blacks, Jews, left-wing people and transgender people in his manifesto. He also offered biographical detail of his mundane life, saying he'd grown up in Conklin, New York, around three-and-a-half-hours away from Buffalo. Gendron added: 'I was never diagnosed with a mental disability or disorder,' he wrote. I believe to be perfectly sane.' The killer was arrested after walking out the front of the supermarket, and arraigned at a court Saturday night. He has so-far been charged with one count of first-degree murder, although more charges will follow. Gendron spoke only to confirm that he understood the charge, with his lawyer saying he'd deny it. That comes despite him saying he'd plead guilty to his crimes in his manifesto. Gendron also likely faces federal hate crime and terrorism charges, which could see him put to death. Advertisement

The supermarket is located in a predominately black neighborhood, about 3 miles north of downtown Buffalo.

U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland was briefed on the shooting, according to Justice Department spokesman Anthony Coley.

Eric County Executive Mark Polonczar confirmed that there had been a shooting in the area and that residents should stay away from the supermarket.

'I have been advised of an active multiple shooting event at the Tops Markets on Jefferson Street in Buffalo,' Poloncarz tweeted. 'Police are on scene. Please stay away from the area.'

New York Governor Kathy Hochul tweeted that she was 'closely monitoring the shooting at a grocery store in Buffalo,' which is her hometown. She said the state has offered assistance to local officials.

Braedyn Kephart and Shane Hill, both 20, pulled into the parking lot just as the shooter was exiting.

They described him as a white male in his late teens or early twenties sporting full camo, a black helmet and what appeared to be a rifle.

'He was standing there with the gun to his chin. We were like what the heck is going on? Why does this kid have a gun to his face?' Kephart said.

'He dropped to his knees. He ripped off his helmet, dropped his gun, and was tackled by the police.'

Will G., a frozen dairy worker at the supermarket, said he walked out of the cooler to stock milk when the shooting occurred.

'I just heard shots. Shots and shots and shots,' he told Buffalo News. 'It sounded like things were falling over.'

He added that he hid in the cooler and that more people joined him to take shelter from the gunfire.

'I hid. I just hid,' he said. I wasn't going to leave that room.'

Police officials and a spokesperson for the supermarket chain did not immediately respond to messages from The Associated Press seeking comment.

The surrounding area is primarily residential, with a Family Dollar store and fire station near the store.

Police closed off the block, lined by spectators, and yellow police tape surrounded the full parking lot. Mayor Byron Brown was at the scene late Saturday afternoon and expected to address the media.

The shooting came little more than a year after a March 2021 attack at a King Soopers grocery in Boulder, Colorado, that killed 10 people.

Investigators have not released any information about why they believe the man charged in that attack targeted the supermarket.

Joe Biden slams 'hate-filled soul' gunman who killed 10 in Buffalo supermarket shooting and claims cops have it 'a heck of a lot harder than ever' as he honors law enforcement killed in the line of duty by demanding MORE funding Joe Biden gave an impassioned plea Sunday during a memorial for fallen law enforcement by asking Americans to 'address the hate that remains a stain on the soul of America' after a racially motivated gunman opened fire at a supermarket in Buffalo. 'A lone gunman, armed with weapons of war and a hate-filled soul shot and killed 10 innocent people in cold blood in a grocery store Saturday afternoon,' Biden said during the 41st Annual National Peace Officers' Memorial Service outside the Capitol on Sunday. The president said that while the Justice Department investigates the crime in Buffalo 'we must all work together to address the hate that remains a stain on the soul of America.' The president and first lady Jill Biden attended the event kicking off Police Week Sunday afternoon outside the Capitol honoring the lives of law enforcement who were killed in the line of duty in the last year. 'Being a cop today is a heck of a lot harder than it's ever been,' Biden said during his remarks for the event hosted by the National Fraternal Order of Police. Biden insisted during his near 18-minute remarks Sunday that his agenda is clearly in favor of funding police, contrary to the far-left calls that began the summer of 2020 for the complete defunding of law enforcement across the country. 'We should agree, it's not to defund the police, it's to fund the police,' Biden said to cheers from the audience. 'Fund them with the resources, the training they need to protect our communities and themselves and restore trust on the police and the people,' he added. The White House says that around 20,000 attendees are at the service and 5,000 family members of the fallen. Attorney General Merrick Garland is also in attendance. Seated next to the President at the dais outside the Capitol were his wife, Senate sergeant at arms Karen Gibson, Senator Patrick Leahy, House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, associate Attorney General Vanita Gupta and the architect of the US Capitol Brett Blanton. The first couple flew to D.C. Sunday morning from their home in Delaware, where they spend most of their weekends away from the nation's capital. National Police Week begins Sunday, May 15 and turns through Saturday, May 21. Biden closed his remarks by saying he is 'committed to remaining' a partner for law enforcement and lauding his budget for Fiscal Year 2023, which includes a doubling in funding for community policing. The speech in D.C. came less than 24 hours after Payton Gendron, 18, livestreamed his racially motivated mass shooting on Twitch at a Tops grocery store in Buffalo, New York. Ten people were killed and three others were injured – 11 of whom were black and two who were white. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg said Sunday that he classifies the attack as an act of terrorism. 'Whether it's called that legally or not, this was terrorism, this was hate,' Buttigieg told CBS Face the Nation host Margaret Brennan during an interview Sunday. He added: 'This would be a good day for every politician in this country left, right and center, every media figure in this country, left, right and center to come out and unequivocally condemn white nationalism, so-called replacement theory, and any other hateful ideology that could have contributed to something like this before it happens again.'

An investigation by French national police authorities was under way last night into the first known case of gun tactics to halt a migrant boat launch.

It marks a major escalation of tension on the beaches as gendarmerie night patrols struggle to control the armada of boats heading for Britain.

The shooting happened in darkness at Dunkirk as eight Iranian Kurds carried a dinghy towards the sea. It was destined to bring 40 migrants from France.

French police have shot migrants with potentially lethal rubber bullets to stop their illegal boat crossing the Channel to the UK

Two Iranian Kurds hit by the bullets were taken to hospital, one with a fractured leg and the other with a broken hand. Those carrying the boat claim that the group of gun-toting police laughed at them as their injured comrades fell to the ground.

One of the shot migrants, 24-year-old Juanro Rasuli, was last night still in Dunkirk central hospital with a fractured left leg, which was wrapped in bandages. He did not want to speak out because of the fear of reprisals.

The second man, who was shot in the hand, is undergoing medical treatment as an outpatient.

The beach shooting is believed to have followed a noisy altercation between the Iranian Kurds intent on launching the boat and the French patrol unit determined to stop them.

Home Secretary Priti Patel has threatened to withhold £54million in payments by Britain to the French government for beach patrols in northern France if officials do not reduce the stream of migrant boats.

This year more than 17,000 migrants of multiple nationalities have reached the UK after making the 21-mile Channel crossing.

Those involved in the incident were asked by the Daily Mail if they were people traffickers or assisting the trafficking gangs for money. They have denied it, insisting they are would-be asylum seekers hoping to reach Britain.

Last night an Iranian Kurd calling himself Mohammed recalled what he saw of the shooting in the early morning of September 22.

At a coffee bar in a migrant camp in Dunkirk, he said: 'There were eight of us holding the boat near the beach. We were getting ready to launch it for 40 people who wanted to cross to your country.

'Then three or four police arrived in one vehicle. One policeman shot Juanro Rasuli at point blank range. I can't remember how many times they fired the rubber bullets.

'When the police saw us, they shouted stop, We stopped and they still shot us. Then we ran away as best we could.' A video of the aftermath of the shooting, taken by the migrants, shows Mr Rasuli lying on the ground with his leg bleeding.

The other shot man shows his injured hand to the camera. A voice says in Kurdish: 'You can see the police laughing at us.'

Rubber bullets are potentially lethal and have also caused blindness and permanent disabilities in those struck in the past. Typically, they have a metal core with a rubber coating and are often used in France in riot control.

The bullets were considered so dangerous that they were banned from use by the police in mainland Britain until 2001.

They were invented by the Ministry of Defence for security services to combat protesters in Northern Ireland and are said to have killed 17 people during the Troubles.

The migrants' shooting took place five miles from Grande Synthe, a suburb of Dunkirk where hundreds of migrants live in squalid camps in woods awaiting a boat to Britain.

French judicial sources insist their beach patrols only use such a show of force when it is 'proportionate' and if the officers are placed in danger by a 'seriously hostile situation'.

Jean Carroll verdict;"Former President Donald Trump has even more legal troubles coming down the pipeline after a New York jury decided Tuesday in favor of writer E. Jean Carroll, finding the ex-president liable of sexual abuse, battery and defamation - to the tune of $5 million.

Carroll's case was a civil case, and while the jury voted in her favor they also said they didn't believe she was raped, knocking the liability down to sexual assault.

In other unrelated cases, Trump could be criminally charged.

And he was already charged in late March in the Stormy Daniels hush-money case.

Here's a breakdown of the barrage of legal troubles the former president is facing:

Former President Donald Trump (left) has even more legal troubles coming down the pipeline after a New York jury decided Tuesday in favor of writer E. Jean Carroll (right), finding the ex-president liable of sexual abuse, battery and defamation

The Stormy Daniels hush-money case: Trump makes history by being the first former president to ever be indicted of a crime

On March 30, Trump made history and became the first former president to ever be indicted.

He returned to New York on April 4 for his day in court - with both pro and anti-Trump demonstrators surrounding the courthouse.

Trump was charged with 34 felony counts of falsifying business records in relation to the Stormy Daniels hush-money scheme in the run-up to the 2016 presidential election.

He pleaded not guilty at the New York Criminal Court, as the 16-page indictment was unsealed. Additionally, a 13-page statement of facts was released by the Manhattan district attorney's office.

It said that between August of 2015 to December of 2017, Trump 'orchestrated a scheme with others to influence the 2016 presidential election by identifying and purchasing negative information about him to suppress its publication and benefit the Defendant's electoral prospects.'

The alleged crimes included writing monthly checks to his former lawyer Michael Cohen throughout 2017 as part of a 'retainer agreement,' with prosecutors saying that there was no such retainer agreement and those payments were actually to pay Cohen back the $130,000 given to Daniels to keep her quiet about her 2006 tryst with Trump ahead of Election Day 2016.

Trump has denied the affair.

Since the initial indictment, Trump's legal team has tried to move the case out of state court to federal court, in hopes that the jury pool would include more conservative jurors from New York's suburbs.

Additionally, on Monday Judge Juan Manuel Merchan ruled that Trump wasn't allowed to post any evidence or other materials from the discovery process onto social media sites.

The former president also isn't allowed to look at evidence without his lawyers present, Merchan ruled.

January 6th: Pence testifies before the federal grand jury and DOJ says Trump can be sued for his role in the Capitol attack

Meanwhile, the Department of Justice's investigation into Trump's role in pushing false election fraud claims and the January 6 Capitol attack plugs on under the portfolio of Special Counsel Jack Smith.

In late April, Vice President Mike Pence testified in front of the federal grand jury assembled to hear evidence from the probe.

Pence had resisted - claiming privilege as the president of the Senate - and a judge acknowledged some of those claims, but green-lit the testimony to go forward.

Trump's legal team had also tried to stop Pence's testimony, but didn't succeed.

That setback comes after the Justice Department said in March that Trump can be sued by injured Capitol Police officers and Democratic lawmakers over January 6, in a federal court case testing Trump's legal vulnerability for his speech before the riot.

The Justice Department told a Washington federal appeals court in a legal filing that it should allow the lawsuits to move forward, rejecting Trump's argument that he is immune from the claims.

In December, before Republicans took control of the House, the House-based January 6th Committee referred Trump to the Department of Justice to pursue at least three criminal charges, including inciting an insurrection.

The recommended charges for Trump concerned four criminal statutes: obstructing an official proceeding, making false statements, defrauding the U.S. and inciting an insurrection.

It's unclear if more charges are on the table for Trump.

In a series of high-profile hearings last year on the aftermath of the 2020 election, which Trump falsely claims he won, the committee made its case that Trump was pressuring Pence to throw the election results back to the states in an attempt to overturn the election results.

Pence did not testify to the Congressional committee, but a number of other top Trump officials did - including Pence's chief of staff Marc Short, Ivanka Trump, Jared Kushner, former Attorney General Bill Barr and Roger Stone.

Trump addressed his supporters on the Ellipse - the area right outside the White House - on the morning of January 6th.

Later that day a mob of his supporters marched to the Capitol and broke into the building to stop the certification of President Joe Biden's win in the Electoral College.

The documents Trump took from the White House to Mar-a-Lago when he left office

The Justice Department - also under Special Counsel Jack Smith - is conducting a criminal investigation into Trump for retaining government records, including some marked as classified, after leaving office in January 2021.

The FBI seized 11,000 documents from Trump's Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida in a court-approved August 8 search, including about 100 marked as classified.

Some were designated top secret, the highest level of classified information.

Special Counsel Jack Smith is overseeing a criminal investigation into classified materials Trump removed from the White House after leaving office in January 2021

The department began its investigation after the National Archives, the U.S. agency responsible for preserving government records, tried to get Trump to return missing government property and received 15 boxes with classified documents mixed in.

Trump has accused the Justice Department of engaging in a partisan witch hunt and claims the documents he took were part of his personal records and were declassified when he left office.

Both Pence and Biden are also being probed for having classified documents amid the materials they brought home after leaving office.

Georgia's criminal probe into efforts to overturn the 2020 election

Trump is facing a criminal probe in Georgia over his efforts to overturn the election.

A special grand jury was selected last May to consider evidence in a Georgia prosecutor's inquiry into Trump's alleged efforts to influence that state's 2020 election result.

The investigation focuses in part on a phone call Trump made to Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, a Republican, on Jan. 2, 2021. Trump asked Raffensperger to 'find' the votes needed to overturn Trump's election loss.

Additionally, last July, Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis' office revealed that the 16 individuals who posed as fake Electoral College electors were targets of her investigation.

Last week, the news broke that at least eight of those electors had agreed to immunity deals.

It will be Willis' decision - and not that of the grand jury - on whether to charge Trump with crimes.

Legal experts said Trump may have violated at least three Georgia criminal election laws: conspiracy to commit election fraud, criminal solicitation to commit election fraud and intentional interference with performance of election duties.

Trump could argue he was engaging in constitutionally protected free speech.

A California federal judge said in October in a separate lawsuit that Trump had knowingly made false voter fraud claims in a Georgia election lawsuit, according to emails the judge reviewed. It is not immediately clear what ramifications Trump could face from the ruling.

New York Attorney General Letitia James' $250million civil suit claiming Trump inflated property values to mislead banks and investors

New York Attorney General Letitia James said in a civil lawsuit filed in February that her office uncovered more than 200 examples of misleading asset valuations by Trump and the Trump Organization between 2011 and 2021.

James accused Trump of inflating his net worth by billions of dollars to satisfy loan terms and get better insurance coverage.

Mar-a-Lago was valued as high as $739 million when it should have been closed to $75 million, the 200-page lawsuit against the Trump Organization claims.

Trump withdrew his own countersuit against James in January after a judge accused him of using the courts to seek revenge.

Trump and his lawyers were ordered to pay almost $1 million by a judge in Florida for suing Hillary Clinton and others over his claims that the 2016 election was rigged.

James is seeking to permanently bar Trump, his sons Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump and his daughter Ivanka Trump from running companies in New York state, and to prevent them and his company from buying new properties and taking out new loans in the state for five years.

James is also seeking to have the defendants disgorge around $250 million that she described as obtained through fraud.

After James announced the lawsuit, Trump in a social media post called the action 'Another Witch Hunt.'

A lawyer for Trump called the lawsuit's claims 'meritless.'

James said her probe also uncovered evidence of criminal wrongdoing, which she referred to federal prosecutors and the Internal Revenue Service for investigation.

Trump appeared back in New York for a deposition last month as part of the case.

New York criminal probe into Trump Organization's 'tax-free perks' to top executives

The Trump Organization is on trial in New York on criminal tax fraud charges.

The Manhattan district attorney's office last year accused the Trump Corporation and Trump Payroll Corp. of giving executives tax-free perks such as rent-free apartments, school tuition feeds and leased luxury cars.

Its former chief financial officer Allen Weisselberg, also named as a defendant in the James lawsuit, has pleaded guilty and is required to testify against the company as part of his agreement with prosecutors.

Alvin Bragg, the Manhattan district attorney, has also been investigating whether Trump misled lenders and others about asset valuations.

Sources close to the discussions have said the government's plan would initially bar access to a category of Chinese students who form the single largest foreign student groups in the country.

According to the New York Times, further educational restrictions could follow, as could retaliations from the Chinese government through implementation of similar visa restrictions on U.S. students and researchers in China.

The plan is the latest escalation in an on-going feud between the two superpowers, which have been using restrictions on trade, technology and media access as ammunition, causing diplomatic relations to be at their lowest point in decades as each new measure is met with fresh retribution.

The Trump administration is set to cancel visas held by Chinese students from universities with ties to the PLA

To make matters worse, China's parliament rubber-stamped a new security law to give Beijing sweeping powers over Hong Kong on Wednesday, sparking global outrage.

The bill gives the Communist Party draconian powers to punish 'secession, subversion, terrorism and foreign interference' and allows its security agencies to operate openly in Hong Kong.

In response, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said that Hong Kong no longer deserves special treatment under trade laws as it no longer maintains a 'high degree' of autonomy from China.

Pompeo issued the statement a day after President Trump issued a threat that if China imposes its new national law on Hong Kong the island would lose its role as a 'financial hub.'

'No reasonable person can assert today that Hong Kong maintains a high degree of autonomy from China, given facts on the ground,' Pompeo said in a statement.

His statement did not revoke any of Hong Kong's specific trade privileges, although some reports suggest that the administration will impose the same tariffs on Hong Kong exports that it does on goods from mainland China amid a trade war that cooled slightly when the U.S. and Beijing reached a 'Phase One' agreement.

Pompeo spoke out after China's parliament voted in favor of laws that would give it sweeping powers over Hong Kong, saying 'No reasonable person can assert today that Hong Kong maintains a high degree of autonomy from China'

While Trump administration is in discussions over how it can punish China for its new Hong Kong laws, plans to cancel some Chinese academics' visas were reportedly already being considered before the latest crisis, which could accelerate the plans.

The move to cancel visas is expected to be met with resistance from U.S. universities, however, many of which rely on tuition payments from foreign students, particularly from the large groups that travel from China to study. The exchange of foreign students is also prized for its intellectual value.

The New York Times reports that official estimates suggest at least 3,000 students could be affected by the proposed visa cancellations, and while that is a small percentage of the 360,000 Chinese students in the U.S., some could be working on important research projects.

University lecturers and administrators have reportedly been briefed by the F.B.I and Justice Department in recent years about the potential national security threats posed by Chinese students, but many argue that the benefits out-weigh the risks.

Institutions say that they have sufficient security measures in place, and that Chinese student's exposure to the liberalizing effects of Western Universities, and their expertise in subject fields, means they are valuable assets to the country.

There are fears among university employees that visa restrictions, coupled with growing scrutiny, will add to anti-Asian racism, risks causing another 'red scare', and could lead to biases against them, for example when applying for jobs once they have graduated.

Frank Wu, a law professor who is also the incoming president of Queens College in New York, told the New York Times: 'In China, much more of society is government-controlled or government-affiliated. You can't function there or have partners from there if you aren't comfortable with how the system is set up.'

'Targeting only some potential professors, scholars, students and visitors from China is a lower level of stereotyping than banning all,' he said, adding 'But it is still selective, based on national origin.'

U.S. Intelligence officials fear that Chinese exchange students can be used by their government to gather information from inside universities, with the government paying their tuition fees if they follow such instructions.

For this reason, the F.B.I and Justice Department are said to be particularly wary of students from schools with ties to the military.

However, others see Chinese students from such schools as potential recruits to do the reverse - to spy on the Chinese military on behalf of U.S. intelligence institutions.

On Wednesday, tensions between the U.S. and China mounted further as lawmakers in the city mourned 'the end of Hong Kong' and said the former British colony 'just becomes another Chinese city' under Beijing's authoritarian control.

Washington said the move would 'fundamentally undermine Hong Kong's high degree of autonomy and freedoms' which were promised when it returned to Chinese rule under a 'one country, two systems' formula in 1997.

Taiwan accused China of 'shattering' the city's freedom, offering Hong Kong residents the chance to move to Taiwan and escape Beijing's rule under a plan for 'humanitarian assistance'.

The security law was 'only the latest in a series of actions undermining Hong Kong freedoms, Mike Pompeo told Congress.

Beijing reacted angrily to Pompeo's statements, saying the decision to revoke Hong Kong's special status 'is the most barbaric, the most unreasonable and the most shameless'.

China says the law was necessary because Hong Kong has become a 'national security risk' following years of anti-Beijing demonstrations.

Chinese authorities and the Beijing-backed government in Hong Kong say there is no threat to the city's high degree of autonomy and the new security law would be tightly focused.

Premier Li Keqiang said lawmakers had 'passed the decision to maintain national security, and it represents the steady and lasting [execution of] one country, two systems, and the safeguard of the long-term prosperity and stability of Hong Kong.'

The move from China prompted immediate warnings that the law would be used to persecute protesters, and China could bring charges of subversion and terrorism against them.

https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/dec/29/maine-trump-ballot-us-supreme-court;US supreme court under pressure to rule swiftly on states’ Trump ballot bans;"A decision by Maine’s secretary of state to prevent former president Donald Trump from appearing on the state’s presidential election ballot will now probably end up before the US supreme court. Maine’s move follows a similar decision in Colorado this month.

There is mounting pressure on the conservative-leaning judicial body to swiftly rule on Maine and Colorado’s application of section 3 of the 14th amendment prohibiting anyone who “engaged in insurrection” from holding office. But neither decision will be the last ballot eruption in an already convulsive election which is likely to see a rematch of Trump versus Joe Biden.

Lawsuits seeking to remove Trump from the ballot have been filed in about 30 states but more than half have already been dismissed, including in California where this week the secretary of state, Shirley Weber, decided to keep Trump on the certified list of candidates for the state’s 5 March primary, and in Michigan.

There are now active lawsuits in 14 states, including Alaska, Arizona, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, South Carolina, Texas, Vermont, Virginia, West Virginia, Wisconsin and Wyoming, seeking to remove Trump ahead of their primaries citing the same constitutional clause.

The 14th amendment, ratified three years after the conclusion of the civil war in 1865, covered a range of issues, including guaranteeing rights to former slaves and a provision to disbar anyone who had taken the oath of office to uphold the constitution who “shall have engaged in insurrection or rebellion against the same, or given aid or comfort to the enemies thereof”.

Like other civil war-era laws that have been utilized to try to contain political extremism – including a failed attempt to prosecute the leaders of a 2017 neo-Nazi Unite the Right torchlight rally under a federal civil statute known as the KKK Act – the section 3 clause was only rediscovered after January 6 riot at the US Capitol.

Technically, section 3 doesn’t require a criminal conviction to take effect.

Nor is it clear if section 3 applies to the presidency. An early draft mentioned the office, but the final draft did not. If it does apply to the presidency, Trump’s lawyers will argue that it is a political question that should be decided by voters and any effort by judges to get involved is a denial of the candidate’s right to fair legal procedure because it was made without the benefit of a public trial.

They may also argue that January 6 was not an insurrection but more akin to a riot that Trump was not himself involved in and that he wasusing his rights of free speech when he cajoled the crowd: “We fight like hell. And if you don’t fight like hell, you’re not going to have a country any more.”

In Maine, the secretary of state, Democrat Shenna Bellows, broke ranks with other similarly positioned officials in other states. In her decision, she cited the Colorado supreme court ruling that the January 6 attack “was violent enough, potent enough, and long enough to constitute an insurrection”.

In her ruling, Bellows said that Trump had “used a false narrative of election fraud to inflame his supporters and direct them to the Capitol to prevent certification of the 2020 election and the peaceful transfer of power” and that he “was aware of the likelihood for violence and at least initially supported its use given he both encouraged it with incendiary rhetoric and took no timely action to stop it”.

The Maine decision was immediately appealed by the state’s Republican party and must first travel through the state’s court system before it can reach the US supreme court.

But both Colorado and Maine are small players in the electoral college system that decides presidential elections. In Maine, Democrats won in in 2016 and 2020 but Trump won one of four electoral votes under an unusual system that allows the state to split its four votes proportionally. In Colorado, Trump failed to win its nine votes in both elections.

Across the political spectrum, private lawsuits aimed at getting Trump off the ballot are being treated as funky, freelance efforts by elected politicians.

The California governor, Gavin Newsom, said Trump should be beaten in the polls and warned that while the former president was a “threat to our liberties” the lawsuits and back-and-forth ballot rulings were a “political distraction”.

After Maine’s decision on Thursday, the Republican senator Susan Collins said voters in her state should decide who wins the election – “not a secretary of state chosen by the legislature”, adding that the decision would “deny thousands of Mainers the opportunity to vote for the candidate of their choice, and it should be overturned”.

For a mere $500, Cameo patrons can receive a customized video from the former president's son, ranging from anything to wishing someone a happy birthday or a requesting a rousing MAGA video clip and nearly everything in between.

On the heels of his father being banned from Twitter, Don Jr appears to be picking up the MAGA mantle, using the Cameo app to further his family's political agenda.

'Guys, Donald Trump Jr here, really excited about being on Cameo, look forward to communicating with you guys,' the 43-year-old said in a brief recorded introduction.

The former president's oldest child, who is the executive vice president of the Trump Organization, described himself as a 'Father, Patriot, Outdoorsman, Political Commentator and #1 NYT Bestselling author' on his Cameo app profile.

Don Jr's Cameo profile appears to be another platform for the Trump family to spread the MAGA gospel after his father was banned from Twitter following the deadly riot at the US Capitol in January.

His presence on the Cameo app has a charitable purpose as well, according to his profile's intro video.

'Also really look forward to helping my friend, Benghazi survivor Mark Geist raise some money for his incredible charity The Shadow Warriors project.'

'Getting K-9s in the hands of vets that need them. Looking forward to doing all that and speaking to you guys real soon. It’s good to be here.'

As of Wednesday, his Cameo profile had a perfect five-star rating based off of 19 reviews, with 411 members of his Cameo 'fan club'.

'Wow!!! Thank you so much Donald Trump Jr. for the fantastic personal video message for my husband. I also want to thank you and your family for all you do for the American people. God Bless the Trump Family!!!' one five-star reviewer commented.

'We appreciate it! We made some Make Fishing Great Again hats. We would love to get you one. Lmk where 2 send (Hidden by Cameo) Erik met you on a hunting trip a while back,' another happy Cameo patron commented.

While Don Jr's $500 price tag may seem hefty to some, it's a bargain compared to Floyd Mayweather Jr's Cameo prices, which will set patrons back a whopping $999 for a personalized message from the retired undefeated boxer.

For those looking for cheaper alternatives, a personalized Cameo video from rapper Flavor Flav is only $250, and $300 for actor David Hasselhoff.

Patrons of Don Jr's Cameo page can provide the former president's son with a customized script of no more than 250 characters

But for bargain-minded Cameo patrons determined to hear from the former president's son, Don Jr is also offering direct messages for $19.99, according to his profile.

The Trump's have a contentious relationship with social media and similar applications, with the former president no longer allowed on his preferred platform after Twitter banned him in January to lessen 'the risk of further incitement of violence', according to the social media app.

Trump Sr remains banned on the Twitter app as of this article's publication date.

The Cameo app was launched back in 2017 with the intention of allowing fans to purchase personalized video messages from their favorite celebrities and athletes.

Users of the app provide a script to the Cameo celebrity of their choice (no more than 250 characters per video), and receive the customized clip shortly thereafter.

Bronson, aged 70, of Luton, was first jailed in 1974 for armed robbery, when he was 22.

He took part in one of the country's first public parole hearings earlier this month and changed his surname to Salvador in 2014.

One of Britain's most notorious prisoners, he has been in jail for almost 50 years after a string of convictions both in and out of prison.

Read on below for all you need to know about the life and crimes of Charles Bronson.

Charles Bronson at his parole hearing - the second in the UK to be held in public

What crimes did Charles Bronson do?

Spending most of his life in prison, Bronson has been found guilty of committing a number of different crimes throughout his life.

Among them are offences related to thefts, firearms and violent offences, including 11 hostage-taking incidents across nine separate sieges.

He was given a discretionary life sentence, with a minimum term of four years in 2000, after taking a prison teacher hostage for 44 hours at HMP Hull.

How long will he stay in prison for?

A release from the Parole Board after Bronson's hearing stated: 'After considering the circumstances of his offending, the progress that Mr Salvador has made while in custody and the evidence presented at the hearings, the panel was not satisfied that Mr Salvador was suitable for release.

'Nor did the panel recommend to the Secretary of State that he should be transferred to an open prison.'

As a result, Bronson is not scheduled to be released from prison any time soon. How long he remains behind bars for is unknown.

Will Charles Bronson ever be released?

Given the latest ruling by the Parole Board, as well as Bronson's old age, it is unlikely that he will be released from prison.

With the panel 'not satisfied' that he meets the conditions for release, he may be condemned to spending the rest of his life in prison.

What was Charles Bronson first arrested for?

The man dubbed 'Britain's most dangerous prisoner' indulged in petty crime from a young age and spent time in juvenile detention, but began his first spell in prison in 1974 aged 22 when he was jailed for seven years for armed robbery.

The years that followed began what would become a familiar pattern - with Bronson constantly having years added onto his original sentence due to his uncontrollable violence behind bars.

While in Walton Gaol - now HMP Liverpool - he randomly attacked two prisoners and was sent to Hull in 1975.

In the next few years, Bronson continued to attack other inmates, adding months to his sentence and being switched between prisons.

Did he ever meet the Kray twins?

At HMP Wandsworth, he tried to poison another prisoner, leading to him being sent to Parkhurst psychiatric facility where he befriended the infamous Kray twins.

He would go on to describe the pair, who ruled the East End of London with their gang during the 1950s and 1960s, as 'the best two guys I've ever met'.

Long criminal history of 'Britain's most violent prisoner' 1974: Bronson's first conviction aged 22. He was jailed for seven years for robbery, aggravated burglary, assault with intent to rob and possession of a firearm. He was convicted for numerous assaults behind bars in 1975, 1978 and 1985, leading to his sentence being extended. 1987: He was released from prison at the age of 34. 1988: After 69 days he was back in prison, sentenced for seven years for robbery at a jewellers' shop. 1992: He was released but weeks later was jailed for eight years for intent to rob. He has been behind bars since then for violent offences committed while in custody. 1994: He was given seven years for false imprisonment and blackmail, then in 1997 he took a deputy prison governor, staff and three inmates hostage for which he received five years. 1999: He took an art teacher hostage for three days and was given a life sentence with a minimum term of three years which expired in 2003. 2014: He was further sentenced to three years for assaulting a prison governor.

What other crimes did Bronson commit in prison?

Again, he continued to attack other prisoners, threaten police officers, took people hostage and even attempted suicide as he was moved from prison to prison.

In 1982, he performed a rooftop protest at Broadmoor, removing tiles from the top of the building. He took part in a number of protests over the years, causing hundreds of thousands of pounds worth of damage.

He was eventually released in 1987, and began boxing in the East End of London, changing his name to Charles Bronson after the actor.

After just 69 days of freedom, he was once again jailed for armed robbery for seven years in 1988.

In 1989, he created a spear out of a broken bottle and a broom handle and ran riot in the nude.

Three years later, he was released - this time lasting 53 days outside jail. He was arrested for conspiracy to rob.

In 1993, he took a librarian hostage and asked police to get him a cup of tea, a helicopter, and an inflatable doll.

Three years later, he took two Iraqi prisoners hostage in Belmarsh, demanding a plane, sub-machine guns and ice cream from police negotiators before releasing them.

He was handed a life sentence in 1999 for taking Phil Danielson hostage and trashing the prison in a 44-hour long siege.

Is he still a Muslim?

In 2001, he married Fatema Saira Rehman, and converted to Islam, demanding to be known as Charles Ali Ahmed.

After they divorced four years later, he renounced the religion.

In 2014, he changed his name to Charles Salvador, after Salvador Dali - his favourite artist.

Bronson's marriage to Paula Williamson

Bronson met a new penpal, the soap actress Paula Williamson, in 2016, and Bronson later proposed to her in 2017 by serenading her a version of the Frank Sinatra classic My Way, from a prison pay phone.

Wearing a black suit, white shirt and dark glasses, he told the panel: 'I've had more porridge than Goldilocks and the three bears. I've had enough of it'

Bronson has repeatedly had years added onto his sentences due to violence behind bars. He's seen here leaving the High Court in London on May 3, 2001

They married in November 2017, and walked down the aisle to the Death March. They had their marriage annulled in June 2019.

She was found dead at her home in Sneyd Green in July that year in her bedroom after taking drink and drugs.

What does Bronson say about his past today?

In total, Bronson has taken hostages in ten prison sieges and attacked at least 20 prison officers.

At his parole hearing yesterday, he insisted he is now a 'man of peace' and asked to be freed for the sake of his 95-year-old mother, who he called 'the duchess'.

Wearing a black suit, white shirt and dark glasses, he told the panel: 'I've had more porridge than Goldilocks and the three bears. I've had enough of it.

'I've been naughty. I've been an activist. I've been up on prison roofs and I loved every one.

'I was protesting against the brutality.

'I've had 11 hostages. Am I sorry?

'Maybe. Would I do it again? Definitely not.'

He described having an epiphany and becoming an artist behind bars when an ex-forces prison officer approached him whilst he was in solitary confinement in HMP Wakefield and gave him 'a pile of paper some crayons and some pencils and said: 'Why don't you do something positive and creative?''

Brinson memorably described the notorious Kray twins as 'the best two guys I've ever met'

'I'm now a born again artist and that's down to him,' he said, telling the panel that he wants to be released so he can 'go home and make a good honest living with my art'.

He told the panel that his pictures sell for £2,000 each now and every week he creates a piece for charities, including Macmillan nurses, which is auctioned off.

'I've raised thousands and thousands of pounds for charities,' he said.

He told the panel he has not had an adjudication in prison since September 2018 when he exposed his penis to his then wife during a visit.

But he insisted he had forsaken violence, telling the panel that he has 'learned how to switch off with deep breathing' whilst listening to birdsong in his cell, rather than resorting to violence in stressful situations.

'I'm ready now. I'm a chilled out man. I'll be going out with a bus pass. I know that if I do anything again I'll die in prison and I'll never get out,' he added.

https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/aug/05/tiktok-gen-z-millennials-data-privacy-trump-china;'I don't care': young TikTokers unfazed by US furor over data collection;"Mauren Sparrow downloaded TikTok in March to pass the time during lockdown. Since then she’s posted tutorials on crafting and videos of her two cats, Calcifer and Jiji, some of which have accrued millions of views and likes.



But with the Chinese-owned app now under fire over data privacy concerns, Sparrow, 29, and other young users have reacted with a resounding shrug.

I’m so used to all social networks having my data that I feel it’s just the price I have to pay to connect with others Mauren Sparrow, TikTok user

“I don’t really care that these corporations have my data as long as I know they have it,” Sparrow says. “At this point, I’m so used to all social networks having all of my data that I feel it’s just the price I have to pay to connect with others.”

TikTok’s future has been in flux for weeks after the US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, hinted at a potential ban in early July. Most recently, Donald Trump approved of Microsoft’s efforts to acquire a part of TikTok’s business, but only if the deal was completed by 15 September. A price has not yet been arrived at but could top $10bn.

Threats of action against the app – which some US authorities fear could share user data with the Chinese government – sent shockwaves through the TikTok community, with many content creators rushing to launch live streams to direct followers to alternative platforms. Videos reacting to the potential ban ranged from technical tips on how to evade it, to anger at Trump, to indifference over data privacy.

“Am I the only one who doesn’t care if China collects my data?” a user in one viral video stated. “Let [the Chinese government] have my data. They know me better than I know myself,” another joked.

TikTok is one of the world’s most popular apps and has been downloaded roughly 2bn times, meaning a ban would not be easy, or popular. Forty-seven per cent of millennials and 59% of Gen Z – the biggest demographic on the platform – said the app should not be banned. Meanwhile, 25% of Gen Z users said they would be more likely to use TikTok if the US banned it. Just 9% said a ban would make them less likely to use it, according to a US survey from the market research firm Morning Consult.

“I think that there would be a riot if TikTok were somehow truly banned in this country,” Sparrow said.

The debate over TikTok’s future has also underscored the generational divide between the lawmakers legislating technology platforms and the people who use them. For Gen Z, which has grown up on Facebook, Snapchat and Instagram, having their personal data collected is a given. TikTok in particular thrives on oversharing, with young people using music to share embarrassing stories and photos of themselves, to the tune of millions of likes and comments. “Some of you are too comfortable on here” is a common refrain in the comments of videos.

On a more fundamental level, most do not believe they have the choice to opt out of data collection, said Josh Golin, the executive director of the non-profit Campaign for a Commercial Free Childhood.

“If you gave most young people a choice between protecting their privacy by getting off social media or staying on social media, they will stay,” he said. “But what if you had a choice to be both on social media and have your privacy protected?”

With a historic hearing involving big tech firms last month and new data privacy laws in California and Europe, there have been incremental steps towards that goal. But many users are not in a hurry to force companies to change their data practices. Studies show Gen Z is more tolerant of targeted advertising and less bothered by surveillance. While 46% of Gen X and 45% of millennials are concerned companies will use their data against them, just 37% of Gen Z is worried, according to a 2019 survey from the marketing firm Mobile Marketer.

It feels ridiculous to worry about China when it seems everyone is literally recording us as we grow up Annie, 19-year-old TikTok user

Annie, a 19-year-old TikTok user who downloaded the app to pass the time during quarantine and now uses it daily, said she finds the US government’s focus on China “ridiculous” when US companies “do the same”.

“Our personal data is collected by endless amounts of private corporations who just sell our details to the highest bidder,” said Annie, who asked to use a pseudonym to protect her privacy. “It feels a bit ridiculous to worry solely about China when it seems everyone is literally recording us as we grow up.”

A spokeswoman from TikTok told the Guardian the company’s security team was led by an experienced, US-based chief information security officer with “decades of industry and US law enforcement experience”. All US user data was stored in the US, she added, with strict controls on employee access. The company has also released a series of informational videos on the app about how to keep user data private and secure.

“Protecting the privacy of our users’ data is critical to TikTok,” she said. “We know it’s not enough to build strong security protections; we’re also educating our community.”

TikTok does collect user data, but not significantly more than many US-based apps. While there are some legitimate concerns about the app – such as whether its content could be influenced by censorship in China or how securely the platform is coded – some have speculated that Trump is targeting TikTok in retaliation for his Tulsa rally, during which TikTok users organized campaigns to book tickets en masse then fail to show up, leaving thousands of seats empty.

Stunts like these, coupled with the app’s popularity in an election year, could make TikTok seem like a threat to the administration, said Ari Lightman, a professor of digital media and marketing at Carnegie Mellon University.

“There is a conservative side of TikTok, but the use of the platform for organizing, activating the masses and doing things to mess with the Trump administration is apparent,” he said.

But while legislators continue to fret, young users remain defiant about their plans to stay on the platform.

Nicole, a 16-year-old who lives in San Diego and uses TikTok as much as five hours a day, said she used it to stay connected with friends – especially during the pandemic. “I wouldn’t leave even if Trump tried to ban it.”

She said her algorithm was geared toward her interests in spirituality, motivational videos and comedy and said TikTok “has allowed people from different parts of the world to connect in ways I didn’t think was possible.

“It made us realize things we thought made us strange or weird were more common than what we thought. It is a place where you can find other people think like you.”";True;0;0.838863730430603;high_neg;0
https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8251389/RICHARD-KAY-former-Eton-Head-Master-Eric-Anderson-died-83.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490;RICHARD KAY on former Eton Head Master Eric Anderson, who has died at 83;"Reclining in her favourite armchair, dogs sleeping at her feet, the Queen Mother was at her most relaxed.

She had watched benignly as her guest honoured her entreaty to do justice to the sumptuous Sunday teatime spread laid out in the saloon at Royal Lodge, her home in Windsor Great Park. And now she was ready to talk.

Between them a tape recorder whirred silently as Sir Eric Anderson, then Head Master of Eton College, gently and with great charm, prodded her to recall from her prodigious memory and intimate knowledge, some of the pivotal moments of the 20th century she had lived through.

Honorable: Sir Eric Anderson

There were ten such exchanges between the last Empress of India and the ruddy-faced and softly-spoken Scotsman, spread over many weekends, and they represented a remarkable collaboration built on trust.

Over the course of the conversations, Sir Eric, who has died at the age of 83, elicited countless stories from her — but she never let her guard down. She had made it a rule never to talk about the Royal Family to anyone, ever since a youthful indiscretion when, aged 22, she spoke about her engagement to the then Prince Albert, Duke of York, which upset her future father in law King George V.

And she saw no reason to change even in her tenth decade.

She did tell Anderson that it was 'a terrible surprise' when King Edward VIII decided to abdicate to marry American divorcee Mrs Simpson. 'It was just a terrible tragedy, it really was. We all loved the Prince of Wales and we thought he was going to be a wonderful King. It was a dreadful blow to his brother (her husband who had succeeded him to the throne) because, you see, they were great friends.'

The Queen Mother had no need to worry about her interviewer. Sir Eric was the most honourable and discreet of men who, after their encounters, transcribed the tapes, typed them up and gave them all to the Royal Archives at Windsor Castle, where years later they were used by Queen Elizabeth's biographer William Shawcross.

From pupils to PMs: Prime Minister Tony Blair pictured in a school group at Fettes College

But Eric Anderson was far more than a safe repository for royal secrets. He was not only the most successful of Eton's modern headmasters but the best connected academic in Britain.

He had the unique distinction of having taught three Prime Ministers — Tony Blair at Fettes, in Edinburgh, and David Cameron and Boris Johnson at Eton. He also taught the heir to the throne, the Prince of Wales, at Gordonstoun where he cast Charles as Macbeth in a production the Queen and Prince Philip saw.

To Blair, Sir Eric was a mentor and inspiration; to Charles — from whom in that play Anderson is said to have drawn a performance of 'naked sensitivity and humanity' — he was the reason the Prince entrusted Eton to educate both Prince William and Prince Harry.

Of his own abilities, Anderson was typically modest insisting his contemporary Dennis Silk of Radley was 'the best headmaster of our generation'.

Quite possibly, but no one, surely, had ever been entrusted with so many confidences. Not once did it cross his mind to cash in on all that knowledge, even though as tutor and confidant to princes and future premiers he had such an abundance of material. He could have enriched himself on the lecture circuit but instead lived modestly in retirement with his beloved wife Poppy, whom he had met at St Andrews University where they both were students.

For this son of an Edinburgh kilt-maker, his passion — along with a love for the writings of Walter Scott — was education. And he spoke out freely on what he saw as the nation's educational disaster.

To Sir Eric, the heart of what was wrong was an ideological aversion to selection by ability. Rather than raising the standards for the many, he believed, it had held back the brightest while creating an 'educational underclass'.

His speech to the Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference in 2006 must have been uncomfortable for his former pupil — the then Prime Minister Tony Blair — as Anderson declared Labour's comprehensive school revolution had left a legacy of 'watered down intellectual education' and 'permissive' teaching theories which allowed pupils to ignore grammar and spelling. It was the equivalent of six of the best for his protégé at Fettes where he was Blair's housemaster.

'There was a sort of chemistry between us,' he recalled. 'Tony was genuinely clever — he had a good enough mind to have become a don — but he was also rumbustious, maddening, pretty full of himself and very argumentative.

'He was forever knocking at my study door. Round it would come, the grinning Blair face which said: 'Sir, I don't think this or that rule is right, can we change it?'

'After that we'd have 15 minutes of brisk argument and then go away, neither having convinced the other but with a degree of mutual respect.'

On one occasion he had to admonish a 16-year-old Blair after the future PM and some friends had sneaked out of his boarding house for a late-night excursion. Young Tony was caught half-way up a ladder breaking back in to the school by police who thought he was a burglar.

Anderson recalled reading 'the riot act' to the boys. 'Tony took it very well,' he added. 'He treated it as, literally, a fair cop.'

Years later another future prime minister was in his headmaster's study waiting to receive punishment too. This was David Cameron who had been reported for smoking cannabis on a small island in the middle of the Thames which he and some friends had reached in one of the school's double sculls rowing boats.

Cameron recalled it as the 'worst moment of my life so far', later writing: 'The strange thing about that interview was that he seemed more nervous than me. I think he found the whole episode shocking, and he was clearly still coming to terms with the words for various drug paraphernalia.

'Because I was so keen not to implicate anyone else, I claimed — totally falsely — that I had only smoked cannabis once at Eton, and all the other times were 'at home in the village'.

'This involved me telling a more and more elaborate set of lies. I am not sure he believed a word I said, but my abiding memory is the moment he asked, 'Yes, Cameron, but who rolled the joint?' '

As for Boris Johnson, Anderson remembered a less than convincing role in Shakespeare's Richard III with Boris playing the king.

Johnson hadn't learned the lines and had them pasted on various pillars. 'The performance consisted of him running from one side of the stage to the other failing to read them properly,' Sir Eric said. A fifth generation member of the Edinburgh family firm of kilt-makers, Kinloch Anderson, Sir Eric declared: 'I live by Scottish standards of rectitude, probity and loyalty. It may sound pious but I believe they matter.' But after school at George Watson's College, Edinburgh, and winning a Carnegie scholarship to Balliol College, Oxford, he decided on teaching, not kilt-making.

At Gordonstoun the ambitious young English graduate took Prince Charles under his wing. In the first play he put on, Henry V, he wanted to give the prince the lead because, as he told his wife, Charles was 'the best reader and, I suspect, possibly the best actor'. But he didn't, fearing it would be interpreted as being 'keen to be noticed by royalty'.

A lifelong friendship followed and it was Charles who encouraged his adored grandmother, then in her 90s, to reminisce with Anderson. He also arranged for Anderson to give Princess Diana informal tutorials in history and literature in the early years of their marriage. Her brother Earl Spencer was a pupil at Eton at the time. As diarist Kenneth Rose noted sardonically: 'I am not sure he made much headway.'

Despite his political conservatism, Sir Eric was viewed by Etonian standards as a liberal when he became head in 1980, abolishing the cane and moderating the school's snooty image. He stayed 14 years and returned later for a further nine years as Provost.

'Like all great school masters, he had a presence. Aided by a lingering burr of a Scottish accent, he had a natural authority without having to display it,' Vice-provost Andrew Gailey said yesterday.

'Remarkably, he was a Head Master liked by both beaks (teachers) and boys.'

Boardroom U-turns do not come much more screeching. Chief executive Alan Jope referenced a “strong message” from shareholders about their opposition to a £50bn tilt at GlaxoSmithKline’s consumer products division, but could equally have described the corporate equivalent of a riot in the ranks. Boards are expected to know when the investors have zero appetite for a “transformational” deal.

Drawing a line under the GSK misadventure won’t be easy, and will require more than a peace offering in the form of a two-year €3bn share buyback. At least the numbers for 2021 were a reminder of the basic solidity that comes with owning an international portfolio of big brands. At 4.5%, Unilever’s rate of underlying sales growth was the fastest for nine years, even if 2021 was a recovery year (especially in China and India) and many peers will be doing better.

Jope should also have a half-chance of quietening the grumbles about Unilever’s supposed obsession with seeking purpose in mayonnaise and suchlike. Come on, it’s the wrong complaint. Modern consumers, if not grizzly fund managers, expect brands to have a view on issues like food waste. Unilever’s problem isn’t “purpose” or “sustainability”; it’s the failure to convert those credentials into superior profits in the way that, say, Nestlé does.

Still, that entire debate looks trivial compared to what’s coming down the track – a serious bout of input cost inflation. In recent years, €100m-€200m has been the annual norm at Unilever, the sort of sum that can be lost in the wash of regular efficiency programmes. Now it’s staring at €3.5bn for 2022. Cue a warning that the whole lot can’t be recovered from consumers and that operating profit margins will fall to 16%-17%, from 18.4% in 2021. The already-abandoned target of 20% now feels distant.

The real test for Jope, then, is his ability to ensure a hiccup on margins doesn’t turn into something worse. The “bulk” will be recovered in 2023, he says, and the rest in 2024. That’s not quite a precise target, but it’s close to being one. And, since Unilever has been around the input inflation track in 2008 and 2011, the company ought to have a reasonably clear view of what’s achievable.

One assumes Jope will survive to lead the fight because the GSK mistake belonged to the entire board, especially invisible chair Nils Andersen. The delivery of operational targets, on the other hand, is obviously the executives’ responsibility. Investors will tolerate some temporary margin erosion in exceptional circumstances, but any diversion from the new virtuous path of day to day predictability would risk another uproar. Keep things boring.

Public accounts committee criticises HMRC’s Covid fraud-chasing abilities

The Public Accounts Committee has clearly hit a raw nerve with today’s highly critical report on HMRC’s Covid fraud-chasing abilities. The response from government came quickly and furiously: no fraudulent payments have been written off and the new taxpayer protection taskforce, a Rishi Sunak creation, is expected to recover £800m-£1bn. So don’t call us ignorant or inactive.

Who’s right? Well, it’s fair to cut HMRC and the government some degree of slack. Covid support schemes such as furlough and Eat out to help out were conceived in emergency conditions and were designed to get money out of the door quickly. It was accepted that there would be more leakage than normal, and there’s no point denying history now.

Yet the numbers here are enormous. HMRC currently expects to recover only £2bn of the £6bn in Covid grants it estimates has been lost to error and fraud in 2020-21. A £4bn gap – and probably more when the 2021-22 estimates are added – deserves a fuller explanation than any we’ve heard already.

Indeed, the plea from government that an “estimate” of a loss is not the same thing as a write-off sounds suspiciously like an attempt to manage expectations. The MPs on the committee are not obliged to play along with it. They should keep pushing.";True;0;0.9042225480079651;high_neg;0

The bad boy of British indie rock music, the former Libertines star ricocheted from one calamity to the next during the noughties as he was caught in a life of drug-use and excess.

Whether it was dating kate moss or Amy Winehouse, sparking a riot at his gigs or being found partying with a grubby entourage of hangers on in 'crack dens', he was rarely out of the headlines.

His infamy reached its peak after he was found to be present at a house party where Cambridge graduate Mark Blanco was 'murdered', with his own 'minder' later 'confessing' to the killing.

But these days the former Babyshambles singer appears to have left the debauchery of his youth behind for the relative comfort of married life in France, becoming a father for the third time earlier this year with his wife Katia de Vidas.

Such has been Doherty's troubles with drugs that for large parts of the noughties it overshadowed his music career. Pictured: The rocker at C a vous in Paris in April 2019

It's a far cry from the wild antics that saw the Northumberland-born rocker catapult into the public consciousness in the 2000s.

His band The Libertines, which had Doherty as the frontman, had gained a cult following after forming in the late 1990s, but it wasn't until they released their debut album 'Up The Bracket' in 2002 that they found mainstream success.

But with success came growing issues with Doherty's drug-use, a problem that would overshadow large parts of his career and personal life.

He was arrested countless times for drug offences – once when 13 wraps of heroin fell from his pocket during a criminal hearing – and pleaded guilty to possession of crack cocaine, heroin, cannabis and ketamine.

Doherty was jailed numerous times, including once in 2003 after he broke into bandmate Carl Barât’s Harley Street flat and stole a guitar and a laptop while The Libertines were touring Japan without him.

As The Libertines rose to fame in 2003, Doherty started a romance with singer Lisa Moorish, something that saw them welcome a son, Astile.

However, the relationship wouldn't last and after they broke up the rocker found himself banned from seeing his son due to his drug habit.

The following year his bandmates kicked him out of The Libertines, citing his rampant drug-use as the deciding factor and urging him to seek help.

Doherty took the opportunity to focus on his new band, Babyshambles, although his tumultuous times continued.

The band triggered a violent riot after they failed to show up to one of their gigs at London Astoria in December 2004.

More than 100 angry fans stormed the stage after being told the rockers would not be performing following a two-hour delay to the midnight show.

Security staff battled to contain the pandemonium as the furious crowd of people started destroying the venue.

Describing the chaos at the time, a witness told NME: 'The curtains were torn down, drinks were thrown, the drum kit was smashed and essentially the entire contents of the stage were destroyed. The security forced the kids back to the other side of the barrier.'

Just one year later in 2005, Doherty would meet supermodel Kate Moss at her 31st birthday party - triggering a relationship marred by chaos and drugs.

At first they were Britain's most talked-about celebrity couple, with their A-list party lifestyle documented daily in the tabloids.

And he admitted having a secret romance with Amy Winehouse when he spoke to the Mail on Sunday in 2012, a year after her death

Moss kept a dignified silence throughout, while Doherty, who at the time was ravaged by a heroin addiction, also gave little away.

But years later he revealed the turbulence that defined their relationship in his autobiography 'A Likely Lad', claiming he once accidentally set off a panic alarm in Moss's bedroom at her home in St John's Wood, North-West London, prompting 12 armed police officers to turn up at the door.

He confessed he pressed the button, which is thought to have been linked to the local police station, while looking down the side of the supermodel's bed for a piece of crack cocaine he had lost.

Doherty's drug-taking has plagued his career, and once led to him pleading guilty in court to seven charges of possession. He managed to avoid being jailed but was ordered to go to rehab – another regular occurrence in his relationship with Moss.

In 2005, she promised to stand by Doherty, the son of an Army Major, when he admitted himself to the Meadows rehab clinic, popular with celebrities, in Arizona.

It was just two months after Moss had been caught appearing to snort cocaine at a West London recording studio, so she was adamant he didn't leave the clinic until he had completed his treatment.

But his trip to the US ended in yet another falling out with Moss. After he told her how miserable he was in the clinic, she said she would cheer him up by taking him by helicopter over the Grand Canyon. She failed to turn up, and shortly afterwards he checked himself out. Moss then dumped him.

In an extract in The Guardian, Doherty said: 'When I set off for my treatment at the Meadows, I had all my drugs hidden in my luggage.'

Arriving at the clinic, he said the staff 'found all the bits in my baggage, plus what I'd hidden inside the lining of my jeans – they really knew their stuff. It was a different vibe than UK rehab – a mix of absolutely loaded trust-fund kids and people trying to avoid federal convictions by doing rehab.

'One guy shared in the group therapy how he was in for looking at child porn on the internet. I couldn't handle that. I refused to be in a group with him. I was horrified.

'After two weeks, Kate was supposed to come and visit me and take me to the Grand Canyon in a helicopter, and I got the right hump when she didn't show up. In the end I did a runner. When Kate found out I hadn't finished the treatment, she told me point-blank that was it, there was no way we could see each other now.

'I said, ""yeah, but you were supposed to come and get me in a helicopter for a day trip to the Grand Canyon"".'

Unsurprisingly, Doherty admits Moss was not happy and the episode was one of the factors that led to the end of their tumultuous two-year relationship in July 2007.

It was during his relationship with Moss that Doherty became embroiled in an incident that continues to raise its head 17 years later.

In 2006 the rocker and his entourage turned up at a house party in east London being held by his drug addict friend Paul Roundhill.

Also present was Cambridge graduate Mark Blanco, who later in the night was allegedly thrown off a first-floor balcony to his death.

Mr Blanco's mother Sheila remains convinced that her son was pushed off the balcony

While police have never charged anyone with his death, Doherty's 'minder' Johnny Jeannevol, known locally as 'Johnny Headlock', later confessed to murdering him. He later retracted this confession and blamed it on taking drugs.

CCTV footage from the night in question showed Doherty with another girlfriend, 19-year-old Kate Russell-Pavier, and Jeannevol fleeing the scene, callously swerving Mark's body.

Officers investigated the case and Doherty was implicated after an inquest into the actor's death but there have been no charges to date.

A new Channel 4 documentary about Mark's death, called 'Pete Doherty, Who Killed My Son?', which follows his mother Sheila Blanco on her quest for answers, was released this week.

Responding to the relaying of the tragic event, Doherty handed a one-line sentence to Channel 4 that read: 'I am sorry for Mrs Blanco's loss and I welcome any assistance people can give her to come to terms with what happened.'

The same year he had one of the most unlikely romances in showbusiness, after it was reported he had a short fling with Big Brother star Nikki Grahame days after he rekindled his romance with Kate.

He reportedly serenaded Grahame at his flat with his guitar, after they met during a night out at London hotspot Boujis.

Nikki's ex-flatmate told The People: 'She'd had a lot to drink and they ended up going back to his place in Notting Hill, just the two of them. He got his guitar out and started singing to her.

Party guest Naomi Stirk recalled that there had been a 'sinister' atmosphere that evening

Renowned FBI agent Grand Fredericks has claimed there must have been 'more than one person on the balcony' the night that a Cambridge graduate was allegedly thrown to his death

Fredericks said the 'reverse projection clearly shows there couldn't be just one person on the balcony'

'Nikki thought he was really sweet and caring but his flat was disgusting. There were needles everywhere and it was filthy.'

In an interview in 2006, Nikki also revealed that Pete was one of her clients during her brief stint as a £500-per-hour escort.

She told MailOnline: 'He was my first booking. He often used the agency. I went round to a flat in London. It was a complete s*** hole full of other druggies playing guitars and just hanging out.

'I ended up snogging him but we didn't have full sex. He was so wasted on drugs he wasn't capable.'

The rocker's brushes with the law would continue, especially in relation to drugs, with numerous arrests, culminating in a 14 week prison sentence in 2007 after he breached a probation order.

In 2011 he had a fling with model Lindi Hingston, a romance that saw the birth of his second child, daughter Aisling.

A week after Linda shared the news of her birth in 2012, Pete said: 'The little girl was two months premature. I said I'd try to be there for the birth... Yeah, she's mine.'

Doherty also revealed that year that he had had a secret romance with Amy Winehouse, speaking out a year after her death from alcohol poisoning.

Speaking to The Mail On Sunday in 2012, he said: 'Amy and I were lovers. I loved her then and, well, I still do today.

'But towards the end, as only lovers can, she became quite mean and cruel to me. She didn't suffer fools... and believe me, she had a mean right hook.'

It is believed that since 2012 the rocker has been in a relationship with Puta Madres bandmate Katia Vidas, a fellow musician, whom he married last year.

Although he now lives a quieter existence, his troubled ways have not entirely left him when in 2020 he was before the courts again, albeit not for drugs.

The singer appeared at Margate Magistrates' Court where he was banned from driving after police officers caught him in the middle of night riding an e-scooter while searching for his dog.

Doherty was already banned from driving at the time and told the court he was unaware he wasn't able to ride an e-scooter while disqualified.

The singer and his The Libertines bandmates opened new hotel The Albion Rooms, in Margate, Kent, in 2020, and gave it a £500,000 revamp guests described at the time as 'ghastly'

That same year he opened up trendy five-storey hotel The Albion Rooms alongside his The Libertines bandmates in seaside town Margate, Kent.

It was given a £500,000 revamp with garish decor guests described as 'ghastly' in 2020, with rooms named after famous poets such as Emily Dickinson and William Blake.

Today, a seven-night stay in its The Delaney double room costs £1,309, while a sea view suite is a jaw-dropping £2,060.

Doherty, who is now overweight in a shocking contrast to his trademark gaunt look during his rock star heyday, has tried to leave his toxic past behind.

He says: 'It's a quiet, simple existence. I get up before sunrise and take the dogs for a walk. Then I go back to bed at six or seven, then get up again.'

He then strolls into the village, buys a French newspaper, which he says he 'pretends to read', and has a coffee and a brandy at about 11am.

'Then I go back home and maybe watch some… movies, listen to some Tony Hancock, have a siesta, walk the dogs again and go to bed.'

Yet Doherty appears in more recent years to be crawling out from underneath his French rock and thrust himself back into the spotlight.

Earlier this year he announced his first solo tour in a decade with 13 dates in the UK and Ireland spread across two months, which included gigs at The Royal Albert Hall.

While last year The Libertines celebrated 20 years of their debut release with a show at London's Wembley Arena.

Which begs the question, why has he chosen to return to the limelight? Something Kate Moss will probably be wondering, too.";True;0;0.8616330623626709;high_neg;0
https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2021/aug/23/we-love-everybody-the-french-drag-couple-making-non-traditional-wedding-dresses;‘We love everybody’: the French drag couple making non-traditional wedding dresses;"On the third floor of a typical Alsatian building in Strasbourg, a door opens on to a bright atelier, dotted with mannequins draped in bridal wear. This is where James and ViviAnn Du Fermoir-de-Monsac live and work, designing couture wedding gowns watched over by their cheerful mascot – a yellow parakeet named Adam. And they do it in drag.

The pair say seeing clients in their drag personas creates an atmosphere where people can be accepted for who they are. They know the traditional experience of buying a wedding dress is not always easy for everyone in a world where the vision of an ideal bride is often still someone thin, white and able-bodied.

“That’s why we chose to open in drag, because we wanted to say to everyone that you are welcome, no matter who you are,” ViviAnn says.

Dresses start at €1,500 (£1,290), and are designed after a two-hour consultation with the client about their needs. ViviAnn’s influences include Jean Paul Gaultier and Christian Dior, while James is a devoté of Coco Chanel and the flapper era; ViviAnn is “obsessed with shoulders”, and takes inspiration from the sparkly costumes she wore back when she competed in dance contests, while James focuses on fine-detailed embroidery work.

James says the different approaches complement each other.

“I calm her down a bit with all the rhinestones, she pushes me to go a bit further,” he says.

But, they say, their main focus is on what their clients want, whether that’s a cape that works for a wheelchair user, or a style that other designers wouldn’t attempt – a recent customer came to James and ViviAnn after a wedding shop told her she couldn’t get married in trainers.

“The marriage industry is still a little bit classical, and there are many people who are forgotten,” ViviAnn says. “No matter what your taste is, no matter what shape your body is, we love everybody and we want everybody to love themselves.”

“We want people to be the best version of themselves on their wedding day,” says James.

Du Fermoir-de-Monsac’s first client was a four-year-old boy who wanted to wear a dress to a wedding, but whose mother feared doing so would attract negative attention. So the pair made him a kilt, which ViviAnn says he now wears to school. “It’s the cutest thing ever,” she says, holding up a picture of the tiny boy in his purple tartan.

James, a chocolatier for Pierre Hermé, and ViviAnn, a hairdresser, met at a drag competition in 2019 – James was a judge and ViviAnn a contestant. They bonded over the fact that they had both made their sisters’ wedding dresses. ViviAnn had studied fashion in Paris at the École Duperré. James is self-taught – he started sewing at the age of 13 on his grandmother’s machine.

When France locked down for the first time in spring 2020, and with no work to be done cutting hair or making chocolate, James called ViviAnn and asked her if she wanted to open a wedding boutique. ViviAnn said yes, as long as they could name it Du Fermoir-de-Monsac (after her father’s pet name for her mother) and as long as she could do it in drag. James decided to join her and quickly got to work on his new persona, named after his favourite childhood film, James and the Giant Peach. (They asked that the names of their drag personas be used for this piece.)

The boutique opened in April and in June they launched the first Du Fermoir-de-Monsac collection in a runway show – a riot of lace, leather, spikes and tulle tailored to a variety of body types.

After the show, James and ViviAnn’s drag personas got “married” in a faux ceremony (though in life they remain friends and housemates).

ViviAnn wore a striking white gown with a ruffled neoprene shoulder piece, James a plunging black jumpsuit and train held in place with a studded leather belt.

“We are close friends in our lives, and we decided, as we were building a bridal dress company, to marry James and ViviAnn,” ViviAnn says. “We married in the name of couture.”

In the year to come, the pair will be presenting their designs at bridal shows, seeking out new clients and, they hope, hiring a small team. At a time when the economic outlook is uncertain and the future of the pandemic unknown, they exude a rare sense of optimism.";True;0;0.9063957929611206;high_neg;0
https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/feb/16/tuesday-briefing-expect-delays-on-route-out-of-lockdown;Tuesday briefing: Expect delays on route out of lockdown;"Top story: Cummings’ role in hiring of friends’ firm

Hello, Warren Murray here, and we can’t fit it all in, therefore careful choices have been made.

Boris Johnson has declared coronavirus case rates will have to be “very low indeed” before England enters a “cautious but irreversible” easing of lockdown restrictions. The emphasis on infection rates is likely to inflame tensions with Conservative MPs who see it as overturning commitments given by Matt Hancock, the health secretary. Anti-lockdown MPs argue case rates will matter less once vaccinations take effect. The prime minister confirmed he would set out a roadmap for ending restrictions on Monday 22 February, including possible dates. “If, because of the rate of infection, we have to push something off a little bit to the right – delay it for a little bit – we won’t hesitate to do that.”

Dominic Cummings was instrumental in a Covid contract going without tender to a company called Public First that was run by his friends, according to court documents. The not-for-profit Good Law Project has brought a judicial review about the granting of the contract for holding focus groups. “I am a special adviser and as such I am not allowed to direct civil servants,” Cummings in a witness statement submitted to the high court. “However, as a result of my suggestion I expected people to hire Public First.” An official at the Cabinet Office wrote in an internal email at the time that it was a case of “Tory party research agency tests Tory party narrative on public money” – the author later claimed it was meant lightheartedly.

The WHO has approved the Oxford vaccine, clearing the way for its rollout via the Covax system that aims to bring vaccinations to poorer countries. For further updates would you ever head to our global live blog.

‘Free speech’ or fines – Proposed laws would allow “no-platformed” academics, students or visiting speakers to sue universities by claiming infringement of free speech. The University and College Union is accusing the government of “fighting phantom threats to free speech” as the education secretary, Gavin Williamson, today introduces plans including a “free speech champion”. A free speech condition would be imposed for universities to stay registered and get public funding, and laws would also cover students’ unions. Williamson said he was “deeply worried about the chilling effect on campuses of unacceptable silencing and censoring”. Hillary Gyebi-Ababio from the National Union of Students said: “There is no evidence of a freedom of expression crisis on campus, and students’ unions are constantly taking positive steps to help facilitate the thousands of events that take place each year.” Universities UK said it was waiting to see the details but “there are already significant legal duties placed on universities to uphold freedom of speech”.

‘The industry is reeling’ – Post-Brexit visa rules for British artists, actors and theatre workers to work in Europe have become a “towering hurdle”, according to an open letter signed by stars including Sir Ian McKellen, Julie Walters, Patrick Stewart, Miriam Margolyes and Anne-Marie Duff. The performing arts union Equity is imploring the prime minister to go back to the negotiating table to ensure visa-free work in the EU.

Equity’s general secretary, Paul Fleming, said the arts and entertainment were worth more to the economy than banking. The UK government says the EU rejected proposals for creative professionals to continue working easily across Europe. “We hope member states will act on these calls by changing the rules they apply to UK creatives. We’re working urgently with our cultural sectors to resolve any new barriers they face.”

‘Facts and causes’ – The US Congress will move to establish an independent commission into the Capitol attack on 6 January. Nancy Pelosi, speaker of the House of Representatives, said it would look at the “facts and causes” of the deadly insurrection. Donald Trump was acquitted in his second Senate impeachment trial because of the political mathematics but both Democrats and senior Republicans have said he incited the deadly riot. The Capitol complex remains guarded by more than 5,000 national guard troops and ringed with eight-foot fences rimmed with razor wire. The troops are expected to remain through mid-March. More than 200 people have been charged with federal crimes and a huge investigation continues.

‘Nowhere near enough’ – Thousands of British military personnel dismissed for being homosexual will be able to have their service medals restored. Gay rights campaigners say criminal records, lost pension rights and blemished service records must also be dealt with by the Ministry of Defence. Gay men and lesbian women were banned from serving in the British military until 2000. Before that about 200 to 250 were thrown out each year and sometimes sent to prison.

Joe Ousalice, 70, a Falklands veteran, was handed back his long service and good conduct medal by the defence secretary, Ben Wallace, last year. They had been removed in 1993 after a court martial when he had served 18 years in the Royal Navy. “This is nowhere near enough,” Ousalice said. “By taking my medal and three good conduct badges that I had, my rank was cut. I had to wait until 60 before drawing a pension, whereas I could have got it immediately.”

Coventry volts ahead – Coventry city council is seeking pre-emptive planning permission for a “gigafactory” beside the city’s airport to make electric car batteries. So far only one company, BritishVolt, has announced it wants to build a UK factory, at a site in Blyth, Northumberland, near Nissan’s Sunderland plant. A joint venture between Coventry council and Regional City Airports aims to attract an experienced manufacturer to start production by 2025. Many in the industry believe the West Midlands will also require a battery plant to supply carmakers such as Aston Martin Lagonda, BMW and the taxi and van company LEVC. The Jaguar brand is to switch to pure electric technology by 2025, before its owner JLR ceases all production of petrol and diesel vehicles by 2036, meaning it will require hundreds of thousands of batteries a year.

Today barring a twist will be a Test match that concludes with India squaring the series at one-all – our live coverage is up and running. Australian Open day nine is likewise under way so get all the updates from the first day of the quarter-finals at Melbourne Park – in developments so far, Naomi Osaka has reached the semi-finals by defeating Hsieh Su-wei 6-2, 6-2. A resolute Jürgen Klopp has vowed to correct Liverpool’s faltering season and denied he needs a break after a difficult time in his private and professional life. Chelsea are remembering why it helps to have a manager who trusts in his tactics and style of play after Thomas Tuchel led his side to a 2-0 win over Newcastle. Sport is facing a “massive spread in the cancer of match-fixing” during the Covid-19 era, investigators have said, with fixers diversifying into new areas and targeting especially vulnerable teams, players and officials. Simone Biles says she would not allow her daughter to be part of the USA Gymnastics set-up following the organisation’s handling of the Larry Nassar sexual abuse scandal. Lando Norris believes he will face the hardest challenge of his career in the new Formula One season.

Business

Asia-Pacific shares have advanced today, putting world equities on course to extend their bull run for a 12th consecutive session as optimism about the global economic recovery and expectations of low interest rates drive investments into riskier assets. Severe freezing weather in the US has helped push oil prices to a 13-month high. The MSCI index of Asia-Pacific shares ticked up 0.45% while Japan’s Nikkei rose 0.4% to a 30-year high. The Hang Seng surged 1.79% to a 32-month high in its first session since Thursday following the lunar new year holidays. Mainland Chinese markets will remain closed until this Thursday while Wall Street was also shut on Monday. The FTSE has picked up on the positive vibe and is set to open higher. The pound is worth $1.394 and €1.148 at time of writing.

The papers

A quarantined arrival giving the thumbs-down from behind a hotel window features across several front pages today. Others look out longingly – the Metro calls it the “Radisson blues”. The i has “Border farce on day one of new hotel quarantine” –picking up, as our story does on how border staff, received their instructions – a lengthy email with five attachments – only two and a half hours before they came into force. The Guardian has “Anger over Cummings role in Covid contract” and stars calling for the government to bring back visa-free work in the EU for creative practitioners.

“Johnson: this must be the final lockdown”. That’s the Telegraph while the Times has “Vaccination is reducing admissions and deaths” – which might further embolden Tory MPs who believe high vaccination rates are enough to warrant lifting restrictions. The Express says “PM: we can be optimistic … but no time to relax”.

The Sussexes’ decision to go even more public via an Oprah Winfrey interview is everywhere. “Harry and Meghan: the final straw” says the Mail: it reports they are set to be stripped of their remaining royal patronages. The Mirror can’t resist doing it as “Royal soap Oprah” and says the palace “fears explosive claims”. The FT leads with “JLR ditches diesel in plan to go electric in 15 years” – our version of that news here. Its picture lead is Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, who has become the first female and first African leader of the World Trade Organization.

https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/feb/09/portrait-of-a-killer-art-class-in-one-of-mexicos-most-notorious-prisons;Portrait of a killer: art class in one of Mexico’s most notorious prisons;"After two decades working in some of Mexico’s toughest prisons, warden Ángeles Zavala thought she had seen it all. Then one morning in 2016, she arrived for work at Puente Grande prison to find a local artist waiting for her. The man had recently completed a few workshops with inmates in another part of the prison, and had a proposal. Speaking in rapid-fire bursts, the artist told Ángeles he wanted to move into the maximum-security prison and live there for six weeks, in order to teach some of the country’s most dangerous inmates how to paint. Through art therapy, he would help them change their lives. And he wanted to start with the veteran narcos of Mexico’s violent drug war.

“I was thinking: ‘What is wrong with him?’” Ángeles said later. “‘Everyone is trying to get out and César wants to live here?’”

César Aréchiga, then 36, had achieved a mild degree of regional renown for his realist paintings the size of barn doors. He was a bear of a man, but with his artistic verve, clear-framed glasses and pack-a-day smoking habit, he seemed more at home in Guadalajara’s trendy coffee shops than in a prison full of gang members. Ángeles was intrigued. There are almost no art programmes for Mexican prisoners; few people are brave enough to teach inside the prisons. If César was crazy enough to try, why not see what might happen?

Ángeles started drawing up a list of inmates, and chose 15 who were either clinically depressed or had a record of fighting. If César was looking for a challenge, she reasoned, she would send him those who seemed most in need of change. “To be honest, my first thought was: ‘All his art supplies will be stolen, and that will be it.’”

César grew up in Guadalajara, Mexico’s third-biggest metropolitan area and a narco stronghold. His life had been marked by the violence plaguing the country as rival cartels vied for control of the lucrative drug trafficking routes into the US. In 1993, when César was a boy, he and his family were caught in a shootout at Guadalajara’s airport. They hid behind a ticket counter, the sound of gunfire and screaming reverberating around the terminal for what felt like hours.

“More than anything, I remember the panic on people’s faces,” César said. A Mexican cardinal was killed in the shootout, which was subsequently seen as a harbinger of the violence that would come to consume much of the country. Later, as a young man, César was on his way to school when gunfire erupted on the street around him. A few feet away, a man crumpled to the ground as the shooter sped past on a motorcycle.

Mexico’s murder rate has more than tripled since 2007, shortly after the military began an offensive against the cartels that have supplied the US’s insatiable demand for cocaine, heroin and cannabis. More than 350,000 people have been killed and 72,000 disappeared in the years since. César painted wounded flesh and the outlines of missing people, incorporating statistics on crimes and fragments of police reports on his work. His first exhibited work, titled Numberless Victim, depicts a young person, bound and gagged, but looking defiantly at the viewer. It was this work that introduced him to Puente Grande prison: he won a contract to paint a large outdoor mural there in 2016. It was a difficult process. As he tried to work, prisoners crowded around him. One inmate asked him how much he was getting paid for the gig, a hint of menace in his voice. Another prisoner said if he really wanted to help, the artist should teach them to make handicrafts to sell instead. Under the blazing sun in the open air courtyard, the idea grew on him: why not teach inmates to paint and sculpt?

“Killers, that was my idea,” he said. It would be therapeutic. He would give people who had used their hands to destroy an opportunity to create.

It was, in many respects, a ridiculous idea. César wanted to enter the prison with scissors, knives and sculpting gouges. But he had an uncanny knack for convincing people, and eventually got permission from the authorities.

Patricia Ortiz

César assembled a small crew to help with his project and film the result – because, he figured, no one would believe him otherwise. None of them had worked in a prison before. One of the first people he turned to was Patricia Ortiz, an actor and old friend. Patricia has elfin features, a pale complexion and long brown hair. She has a tendency to speak in stories, her expressive face coming alive as she recounts a previous job working on a theatre project in Tepito, the historic home of gang activity in Mexico City.

When César told her about his art therapy project, she jumped at the chance to be involved. They are the same age, but Patricia speaks of César with a loving frustration usually reserved for wayward younger siblings. From her perspective, her role was to keep him in line. She knew his impulsive nature and stubbornness had got this project off the ground, but she feared it could also get them into trouble. “César lives a life of extremes,” she told me. “When you’re beside him you can experience incredible things, but also some of the worst things in your life.”

On an autumn morning in 2016, Claudia Becerril was at her therapist’s office in Mexico City talking about the six weeks she was about to spend working in prison. Small but tough, with a broad smile, she was the only woman on her university cinematography course. One tutor tried to haze her into quitting by giving her the heaviest equipment to carry. A keen rock climber, Claudia managed just fine. Her doubts about working in prison were less about the inmates than herself. Fresh out of a long-term relationship, she was feeling a little fragile. Was a maximum security prison the best place to get over a breakup?

A few months earlier, César had come across Claudia’s reel from film school and noticed how she had expertly filmed sculpture using close shots of hands at work. He decided she was a perfect fit for the project, and asked if she wanted to join him at Puente Grande. She said yes immediately. She believed in rehabilitation, and jumped at the chance to understand what drove the violence that was scarring the country. Like César and Patricia, she was part of a generation of middle-class Mexicans who grew up in the shadow of the drug war. What better way to understand the seemingly senseless violence than to go to prison?

On the first day of the project, César, Patricia and Claudia were still a few miles from the prison when they started losing phone signal. (The prison’s signal blockers are supposed to make it impossible to reach the outside world.) As they rounded a bend, Puente Grande’s hulking grey outline came into view. In the car park, throngs of vendors hawked goods as family members queued at the gate to bring food to loved ones inside. With more than 10,000 inmates and a constant flow of visitors and staff, the Puente Grande complex felt more like a city than a prison.

Puente Grande is, for many, a symbol of successive governments’ failure to control organised crime as well as crime’s power to corrupt authorities. Joaquín “El Chapo” Guzmán escaped from the prison in 2001, purportedly in a laundry cart. (According to another version of the tale, the guards simply opened the doors and he walked straight out.) In 2016, Mexico was approaching the 10th anniversary of the disastrous “war on drugs”, and the country’s murder rate was surging toward an all-time high. Whatever the authorities were doing, it wasn’t working.

Entering the prison was like going into a labyrinth. Accompanied by two security guards, the three artists walked down concrete passageways as clanging doors reverberated loudly in the enclosed space. When César entered the communal area, he could glimpse daylight from windows at the top of high walls. He waited in an empty room as guards led in the inmates, shackled at the wrists and ankles. Lined up in silence, the inmates listened as César made his pitch. He would move his apartment into the prison, he said: “I’ll be in your house, and you’ll be in mine.”

The inmates just stared.

One Honduran American inmate, Parvis – then in his early 30s with a boyish face, short hair and tattoos creeping up his neck – had spent the best part of a decade in prisons in the US and in Mexico. He recalled the curious sight of seeing an educated, well-spoken man who appeared to have wandered into their world by mistake. “He was very sincere,” Parvis said of that first meeting, “but you could tell he was afraid. He was shitting bricks.”

The prisoners had doubts. Art classes, cameras, women in the prison? It was all hard to believe. More importantly, they were concerned that by appearing on film, they risked revealing to their enemies where they could be found. “I didn’t know if as soon as I got back out I’m going to die, if they’re going to pick me up, chop me up and kill me,” said Parvis. They also didn’t know anything about César and his crew – who were these people, and who had sent them? To assuage those concerns, César promised that once the course was complete, he would return to the prison and show them the footage before he showed it to anyone else. If the prisoners didn’t like some parts, he would delete them. They had power of veto.

Despite their misgivings, the inmates agreed, eager to do anything that got them out of their underground cells. Taking part in the workshop could also help their cases before the Parole Board. César and his crew began moving his furniture and art equipment into the prison. He brought sofas, armchairs, coffee tables, rugs, plants and a chess set from his home. Then came the turpentine, paintbrushes, easels, two tonnes of dried clay, staplers, sculpting tools and scissors for workshops. The guards scanned and inspected each item for hidden weapons or drugs.

The first day of class was on 1 November 2016. Hands manacled behind their backs, the men were led single-file out of their underground cells and up to the hall. The doors opened and the prisoners stared at the furniture bathed in sunlight. As the guards uncuffed the men, César stood waiting to shake their hands, as though he was welcoming them into his home.

One prisoner plopped down in César’s chair and exclaimed to no one in particular: “It’s been 15 years since I’ve sat in an armchair.” Another stretched out on a sofa and promptly fell asleep.

César tried to sound upbeat, and began showing the men all the material they would be using: canvas, clay, paper. It was hard to tell whether they were interested in the work, but the men revelled in their status as the privileged few allowed to spend hours out of their cells. Behind them, inmates not in the workshop pressed their faces up to the glass to watch. As César gave instructions, he was interrupted by shouting outside. Turning, he saw a gigantic figure banging on the glass and demanding to be let in.

The next day, the giant returned and again asked to take part. César asked the warden about him. “He has the worst disciplinary record in the prison,” Ángeles told him. “He won’t be able to do the workshop.” But César insisted, impressed by the man’s enthusiasm, and eventually Ángeles relented. Better known as “Escalera” or “the Ladder” for his towering 6ft 6in frame, Enrique was charismatic, funny and had the square jaw and strong features of a Hollywood leading man. But he could also be unpredictable, aggressive and deceptive.

César thought clay would be a good place to start. As he poured dry clay and water on to a large tarp in the middle of the room, he told the prisoners to take off their shoes and use their feet to mix the materials. “We’re not allowed to take our shoes off, it’s against the rules,” one prisoner replied as guards watched from a distance. César waved away their objections. “Just do it,” he told them. A few minutes later, he watched as two members of rival cartels gleefully stomped up and down shoeless in the dirt alongside each other, orange uniforms rolled up to their knees.

“We were like little kids running around,” Parvis said. “Outside, we were enemies. We would probably have killed each other as soon as we saw each other, but here we were having fun in the mud.”

When it was time to make sculptures with the fresh clay, a diminutive man with salt-and-pepper hair and a wide, infectious grin quickly demonstrated his passion for the task. He would ignore the surrounding chatter and become absorbed in the work. “I’ve spent a long time looking at my hands and how they have changed over the years,” he said while holding them up, his face alight with the pleasure of recognising this newfound talent. Claudia, the photographer, said: “Only later did we learn he used to make bombs.”

Claudia had been warned to avoid divulging personal details in case it made her an extortion target. But as she sat around the dining table where the crew and the prisoners shared meals, she was honest when answering the prisoners’ questions. When they asked what she earned in a month, she hesitated a second before telling them. The inmates just laughed. “I used to tip that much in the bar!” Enrique said, howling with laughter.

Parvis – despite being in his 30s and having eyeballs tattooed on his eyelids, and what looks like an anchor on his right cheek – had a youthful enthusiasm and openness that made him seem more like a teenage rapper than a prison veteran. When César had the inmates cover the prison’s brick walls with huge sheets of brown paper and paint over them, Parvis began drawing the anarchist circle-A, a large version of the tattoo he got on his hand as a rebellious teenager. Then he added multicoloured handprints and hearts.

One prisoner, a small man with a downturned mouth and penetrating gaze, recalled his life before prison while César painted his portrait. As a young man he had planned to follow in the footsteps of his upright, hardworking father who had waited tables and washed dishes until he eventually ran a restaurant. “I saw how people looked down on him for being a worker,” he said. “At that point I get this rage inside me, this bitterness.” He realised that whatever his father achieved, people wouldn’t respect him. “Then I got tired of serving. And I wanted other people to serve me,” he said. “That’s why I did certain things.”

Enrique, the towering troublemaker, turned out to be César’s star pupil. The two shared a dry, sometimes dark sense of humour. Through Enrique’s jokes about corrupt politicians and bribing judges, César felt like he’d glimpsed the truth about how Mexico really worked. And in return, Enrique threw himself into the work, quickly demonstrating an eye for painting. For the first few weeks, the inmates kept up their tough-guy facades when talking about the past. Enrique was the first to open up.

That moment came in the third week. During a break between classes, Enrique sat on the floor, sketching an outline of his cell for César. There was a brief silence as the conversation dwindled. “I have kind of a dramatic story,” Enrique said, long arms hugging his knees.

“What’s that?” César asked.

“I’m only here because of some stupid shit,” Enrique replied. He explained that he had attended one of Mexico’s best universities in Tijuana, and had been studying to become a dentist. One day in his second year of college, Enrique heard from a friend that another student had grabbed his girlfriend’s butt. Enrique punched the guy so hard the man stumbled backward, fell from a second-storey balcony and died. As a result, Enrique served a year in a notorious maximum-security prison near Tijuana. “And that’s when I got connected,” he said. “The truth is, this is Harvard, this is the university of crime.”

For César, the conversation was a revelation. In Enrique’s story he saw the tragedy of the criminal justice system. But it was also personal. In Enrique’s version of events, where one mistake threw his life off course, César saw himself.

Years earlier, César had seemed bound for a promising career in the US. But while returning from a visit back to Mexico, he was questioned by US customs officials over apparent irregularities in the sale of several of his works in New York, where he’d been living for five years, rubbing shoulders with the art scene’s elite. Adamant it was a mistake, he says he tried to explain away the issue, grew frustrated when he couldn’t, and raised his voice. Next thing he knew, he was in Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention awaiting deportation. That was the moment everything went wrong. His assets frozen and art contacts suddenly worthless, in a matter of days César Aréchiga went from being a fast-rising artist in New York to being broke, banned from the US and forced to move back in with his parents.

Ultimately, he got back on his feet, though not back to New York. César was middle-class and knew how to speak to the rich and powerful, but he knew that one mistake could change everything. “I saw those guys in orange,” César said, “and I felt that fear, that, for some stupid shit, I wouldn’t get out of there.”

Enrique deputised himself as César’s right-hand man. When the others remained stretched out on the sofas after lunch, Enrique would stand up and say: “Let’s get to work.” And they did. No one else would get away with this, but from Enrique they tolerated it.

When a gouge for sculpting clay went missing one afternoon, Patricia started to worry. It could be used as a shiv, and they had to find it – the project depended on it. At the same time, if they accused the inmates of stealing and the gouge was merely mislaid, the crew could ruin the delicate trust they’d built. Then Enrique stepped in. “No one leaves here until we find it,” he announced. They all searched the room, and the gouge reappeared.

Patricia’s role was to build trust with the inmates. She made a point of showing that she wasn’t scared of them by making eye contact and engaging them in small talk about their soccer teams or home towns. When it was time to start a new project, she would guide them with a gentle hand on the shoulder. As the prisoners painted, she would circle the room and ask about their work, which often led to other topics.

Santiago, a middle-aged man with a fatherly air, was initially reserved, but began opening up as he painted a scene from his home town. “You listen. You talk to us like normal people,” he said, by way of explanation. Parvis, in particular, spoke for hours while he worked on landscapes. “You can’t talk to another cartel member and tell them ‘I feel bad about what I did’,” Parvis said. “You don’t do that. You just don’t do that.” With a 36-year sentence hanging over him, he wasn’t sure he would ever get out. But the interest César and his team showed encouraged Parvis to keep thinking about what had led him to this point.

Over long afternoons painting and talking with Patricia, Parvis could almost forget where he was. He told her about the tough years he spent in Honduras as a small child amid worsening gang violence; how the family was forced to flee when his father was threatened, making the perilous journey through Mexico and into the US. They settled in Arizona, but when his father was arrested, Parvis was placed in a group home. He joined a gang soon after.

As Patricia listened, she thought how easy it would be for anyone who had grown up like that to make the same mistake. But then a thought occurred to her: “I love this bastard, but I knew these eyes that I was staring into were the last thing someone saw before he killed them.”

Enrique mellowed as the weeks wore on. Talking about his estranged family seemed to help him find a new, more sensitive side of himself. When he arrived one day looking morose, he said simply: “I miss my kids.” The structure of the classes also helped him find purpose. “Normally people like us don’t like to work,” Enrique said. “But this teaches me to keep going. I look at myself and I like what I see.”

When guards handed Enrique a stack of letters from his family, going back months, he flew into a rage, convinced they had been intentionally withheld as punishment for fighting. But César managed to calm him down. By the end of the day, Enrique and César were laughing, smoking cigarettes and reading the letters together.

With their newfound liberty in the classes, the prisoners also began to reexamine the hardships of prison life they had become accustomed to – and the contrast could be brutal. After a day painting landscapes or talking about his childhood, Parvis began to resent the pat-downs, daily searches of his cell and having a camera watch him every moment of every day. For the inmates in César’s programme, each search threatened to cut short the time they could spend in the workshop. “When the guards start getting a little strict with you, you’re like: ‘You know what, I could end up killing for this moment, dude, because I’m probably never going to get it again,’” he said.

The growing bond between crew and inmates caused other problems, too. With the attention and special treatment they lavished on the workshop’s chosen few, the crew had inadvertently destabilised the prison’s balance of power.

Things escalated one lunchtime. The crew and inmates were lined up to eat together, as usual. One by one, they were handed trays of food by the guards. But when Patricia arrived, they told her there was none left. Something had gone wrong with the order, they said. The inmates were used to this: Santiago, the normally reserved older prisoner, offered to go without so Patricia could eat. She snapped. “We want food for everyone,” she yelled, now surrounded by other prisoners.

“We’ve had enough, you bastards,” a prisoner yelled. A chair went flying. Patricia saw Santiago, surrounded by other prisoners, his face filled with rage.

Fearing a riot, César pulled Patricia aside. “What are you doing?” he hissed. She caught herself and backed down. Patricia asked Santiago to help her, while César herded the inmates back to the workshop to avoid further confrontation.

“It was stupid,” Patricia said. “I was able to walk out the door and eat in a hotel, and they would end up in the hole.”

After several weeks, Enrique was so trusted that no one questioned him putting himself in charge of helping to collect supplies at the end of the day. Then one evening after packing up, a crew member told César some paints were missing. He suspected Enrique was stealing them to trade for cigarettes. César was initially disappointed, but decided not to immediately confront Enrique. First of all, he didn’t want to alienate a man who had become the poster boy of his art therapy workshops. But he later chose to believe that the theft signalled something else: others in the prison wanted to paint enough that they were willing to trade cigarettes for art supplies.

At times, this growing closeness made the crew uncomfortable. While chatting in a group, one inmate made an offhand comment about another, a younger man who kept to himself. “He’s the one who killed those students,” the first prisoner said. When she left the prison later, Patricia couldn’t stop thinking about it. She felt the dissonance of going from protesting against the 2014 disappearance (and presumed killing) of 43 students, an event that shocked the world, to teaching art to someone who had apparently committed similar crimes against other student demonstrators. She thought of the thousands of people looking for their disappeared relatives in mass graves, then saw herself teaching those responsible how to paint: “I started to ask myself whether we really were doing something to benefit people, or if we were led by our egos or a romanticisation of art.”

At the end of the course they ate a last meal together, and said their goodbyes, hugging like old friends.

About a year later, César was painting in his studio in downtown Guadalajara. Outside, trucks carrying rifle-wielding police in body armour trundled through the oppressive traffic. His phone bleeped – it was Enrique. He was using a Facebook profile under a different name, but César recognised his photo. “What’s up fatso,” wrote Enrique, who, despite his affection for César, was never exactly polite. Enrique was out, he explained, and back living with his wife and children, fixing up motorbikes. “I’m trying to make this work,” he said. He sounded happy.

On the walls of César’s apartment hung portraits of the inmates he had painted. There was Enrique, looking dashing, and Parvis. Santiago’s clay sculptures, of birds and people in Aztec and Olmec styles, stood on a table in his living room. Cesar felt hopeful that his project had made a positive impact, at least for someone.

A few weeks later, César got another message from Enrique’s profile. “Hi César, how are you?” it said. He knew immediately something was wrong – Enrique was never this well mannered. It was Enrique’s wife. He had been kidnapped by rivals in the drug trade, she told him. A few days later, the prosecutor’s office called. César listened as the man told him that Enrique had been found dead.

Not long after, César finished work on a documentary about his time in prison, exploring the artistic process and redemption. It premiered to acclaim at the Guadalajara film festival. For César, it was a bittersweet moment. He was proud, but the person he had most wanted to see the film, Enrique, never would.

Visiting her home town in northern Mexico for Christmas some time later, Patricia made an impromptu stop to buy a sweater. She was inside the changing room when her phone rang. “Number unknown” flashed up. She answered and a familiar, playful voice spoke: “Can you guess who this is?” It was Santiago. He was just calling to say hello, he said, and made small talk. She inferred immediately that he was back with the cartel. It saddened her to think that he had picked up right where he left off. Patricia suddenly felt that the workshops alone were useless: they had been trying to fix a few cogs of an unimaginably vast machine.

Meanwhile, César still hasn’t finished the portrait of Parvis. For a while they swapped messages, then Parvis disappeared again. Recently César heard his old student is out and living in a medium-size city somewhere in Mexico.

In a tree-covered garden earlier this year, Parvis took a rare break from his busy schedule to talk to me. A short beard partially covered his neck tattoos. For the first time in a while, he thought back to that time spent years earlier with César, Patricia and Claudia in the prison. Lately, he has been teaching his kids to draw. Sometimes, he thinks about going back to the US.

Every day, Parvis picks up the phone and dials the US, where he calls clients in English and Spanish for his work at a paralegal firm. It’s still a struggle sometimes. He heard what happened to his friend Enrique. But he cites his time with César as important in leaving his old life behind. “If that project hasn’t changed everyone,” he said, “it has most surely made a difference in my life and in my children’s lives.”

Somewhere within the hallowed precincts of London’s Royal Courts of Justice on Monday, one of Britain’s most notorious criminals will launch an extraordinary bid to get out of jail.

Even if he isn’t there in the flesh, Charles Bronson’s very recognisable — some might say terrifying — face will be beamed into the room via video link from high security HMP Woodville in Buckinghamshire as he pleads, not for the first time, for his freedom.

Bronson was sent to jail for armed robbery in 1974 but has spent nearly half a century locked up because of violence committed inside prison.

He will argue that, at 70, he is a reformed character, a ‘born-again artist’ who — in his own characteristically theatrical words — is more likely to be found carrying a ‘sawn-off paintbrush’ than a ‘sawn-off shotgun’ now that he is in his dotage.

His dream — says the Category A prisoner notorious for attacking prison staff and inmates, taking hostages and staging rooftop protests — is to live out the rest of his life, peacefully, in a caravan on the south Devon coast and make money by selling his paintings.

A heartwarming image indeed — but could Bronson, who was handed a life sentence in 1999 for holding a prison art teacher hostage for three days and threatening to kill him with a makeshift spear, really be about to get his longed-for happy ever after?

Notorious prisoner Charles Bronson, here 58, leaving the High Court in London, 3 May 2001

For while he may be the first prisoner in British legal history to request and be granted a public — rather than closed-door — parole hearing, even members of his own family told the Mail this week that they doubt he will be let out any time soon.

‘He’s got absolutely no chance of getting parole at the moment,’ says one relative, who has asked not to be named. ‘You don’t get released out of a Category A prison. He’s not even been downgraded to an open prison. You have to work your way down the system.’

While a panel of legal experts, psychologists and probation officers will examine his case on Monday and Wednesday next week, even Bronson’s most ardent supporters fear he may have already scuppered his own chances.

At the root of their concerns is a Channel 4 documentary which aired this week featuring footage of Bronson — who now calls himself Charles Salvador, after the surrealist artist Salvador Dali — speaking from his prison cell via video calls.

The Mail has discovered that the videos were covertly recorded during lockdown when all in-person visits to prisons were cancelled and Bronson — who knew by then that he would be getting a public parole hearing — was given temporary permission to make the calls.

More, in a moment, of what he said on camera about his past crimes — not to mention his ‘regret’ that he missed out on the infamous 25-day riot at Strangeways Prison in 1990.

Bronson was moved to a different prison just three weeks before violence erupted at the Manchester jail, resulting in the death of one prisoner and injuries to 147 prison officers and 47 prisoners, with £55 million of damage caused.

‘I f*****g missed it by three weeks. It is a great regret of mine,’ he lamented. ‘I would have loved... I think I’d have still f*****g been up there.’

Speaking about his time in prison, he added: ‘I’ve gotta be honest with you, I’ve had a f*****g party.’

When asked if he felt remorseful about his violent behaviour, Bronson’s response that ‘you can’t live your life, regretting your life’ is not likely to go down well with next week’s Parole Board panel.

The onus will be on him and his solicitor to show that he is no longer a risk to the public. Bronson has already tried and failed seven times to convince Parole Board members of exactly that.

But this time around, he says he can ‘actually smell and taste freedom like I’ve never, ever done in my life’.

Among those praying that he’ll finally get out is Bronson’s 70-year-old first wife, Irene Dunroe. She still refers fondly to her ex-husband — whose real name is Michael Peterson — as Mick.

Speaking exclusively to the Mail this week at her home in Wirral, Cheshire, she said: ‘I strongly believe he should be released. Mick is no threat to anybody any longer and he deserves to be free.’ The pair, who married in 1972, divorced in 1975 and have a 50-year-old son, Michael, speak on the phone regularly.

Bronson, she says, wants to live ‘down south’ and get two dogs named Ronnie and Reggie — after the Kray twins with whom he was friends while inside — and take them for walks on the beach. The pair, who are close but do not intend to get back together, have made other plans.

‘If Mick does get out,’ she says, laughing, ‘we are going to run the London Marathon.

‘He will be dressed in a robber’s outfit and I will have a police uniform on and be handcuffed to him. I jog every morning for 70 minutes.’

If he does leave prison, Bronson says he plans to retire to the countryside to paint

Irene also says that Bronson, who was a bare-knuckle fighter in his youth and has prided himself on keeping super-fit in his prison cell, has been challenged to a one-off fight which ‘will make him a lot of money’.

But what he wants above all, she says, is to be able to devote himself to his artwork. ‘He loves his art,’ she says. ‘He just wants to get out of prison and enjoy painting.’

He is apparently particularly desperate to work with oils, which are banned in prison because they are flammable. Bronson says his art has helped him survive life in jail over the past near half century.

He has won 11 awards for his art and poetry from the Koestler Trust which works with prisoners. Some of his pen and pencil drawings went on display at the Henarch Galleries in East London last week in the hope of boosting Bronson’s chances of parole. Entitled Stay Sane, the collection included works priced from £700 to £30,000 for a series of nine pen and paper drawings — all said to showcase the ‘ingenuity and creativity’ of Charles Salvador Bronson.

According to the show’s curator, Oliver Hammond: ‘If we can show that Charlie genuinely wants to be released from prison to work on his art, I think there’s definitely a good chance this can help with his parole. Why would someone want to create the works he’s created behind a cell door. Why wouldn’t he continue that on a larger scale?’

Bronson’s supporters say he has been through ‘hell’ while being held in solitary confinement but that by channelling his emotions into art, which he sells to raise money for children’s charities, he has managed to rehabilitate himself.

Such claims are ironic given that it was said to be a gentle word of constructive criticism about one of his drawings that led Bronson to attack and take hostage mild-mannered prison art tutor Phil Danielson during a class in HMP Hull in 1999.

Bronson tied a skipping rope around Mr Danielson’s neck and, over a 44-hour period, tugged him about, jabbing him with a spear made from a knife fixed to a snooker cue with bandages, telling him he was going to kill him. He later told his rescuers: ‘I thought I was going to be sacrificed on the snooker table.’

Mr Danielson, now 60, was diagnosed with PTSD after the incident and has been unable to work since the attack. He told the Channel 4 documentary: ‘I remember him telling me: “Take your last breath because this knife is going in you.” I was terrified out of my mind.

‘The damage that was caused by him has moulded my whole life since 1999 — 23 years nearly. It will be with me for the rest of my days. The big dilemma is how long does it go on? Is it better that he stays in for the protection of us all? Is it better he is let out because he has served so long?’

Tellingly, while speaking about the incident during the video call shown on the documentary, Bronson failed to say he was sorry for what he did.

‘I went over the top as I normally do,’ he said. ‘I never hurt the man. Mentally, obviously. He didn’t deserve what he got, but did I deserve a life sentence just for wrapping him up?’

The kidnapping, which came on the back of several violent incidents behind bars, saw Bronson given a life sentence at Luton Crown Court in February 2000. Mr Danielson said that while he would never forgive Bronson for what he did, ‘part of me does think maybe justice has been done’ because ‘it’s 23 years’.

He said Bronson should only be released if he is genuinely sorry: ‘He needs to show remorse and it needs to be documented not just clever talk to get himself back in the papers.’

Born Michael Gordon Peterson in Luton in 1952, Bronson later changed his name thinking the moniker of his Hollywood actor namesake would make him appear tougher.

He is the second of three sons born to Joe Peterson and his former beauty queen wife Eira, who once ran the Conservative Club in Aberystwyth.

While Bronson’s brothers have both done well in life — one is a businessman who emigrated to Australia, the other, a retired military policeman who served in the Navy, the Falklands and Bosnia — he showed signs of dysfunction as a child, attacking fellow school pupils and even battering a teacher.

After leaving education, he worked on building sites and as an industrial painter. At 18 he married Irene and they had their son, Michael.

At 21, he embarked on what he would later call ‘a week-long mission of madness’. After robbing a post office for just £20, he was found guilty of armed robbery and, in 1974, jailed for seven years.

After being released in 1987, he embarked on an illegal bare-knuckle boxing career in the East End of London but was arrested just months later and convicted of planning another robbery.

In another bizarre twist in the never-ending drama that is Bronson’s life, the video calls in the TV documentary were recorded by retired paparazzo George Bamby, who since 2017 has claimed to be the criminal’s long-lost son — a claim refuted by Bronson’s family and friends.

Bamby says that he ignores Bronson family members who accuse him of doctoring a DNA test certificate to make a ‘fake’ claim about being his son.

‘I don’t have anything to do with anyone else,’ he told me this week. ‘I concentrate on working with him and that’s it.’ Irene, the first of Bronson’s three wives, is among those who say Bamby’s claim is a hoax. ‘We have all asked George to take a proper DNA test. If he did and it came back positive that he is Mike’s son we would welcome him into the family with open arms,’ she says.

The relative who spoke to the Mail this week said that Bronson had gone along with the ‘long-lost son’ story, believing that Bamby would use his media contacts to raise publicity for his case and get him out of prison.

The relative adds: ‘It’s all utter nonsense. Bamby won’t agree to do a proper, legally binding DNA test. The stories he’s put in the paper over the years haven’t done Charlie any good whatsoever and I’m worried this documentary has put the final nail in the coffin.’

Bamby stands by his decision to show the footage, saying: ‘People need to see Charlie as he is now. He’s a 70-year-old man. I’m passionate about him and the way he has been treated. He’s not a danger to society. The only thing he’s a danger to is an A4 pad and a packet of crayons.

‘He’s been really nasty and evil and horrible in the past but that was years ago. He wants to be a full-time artist and dedicate the rest of his life to his artwork.’

The businessman, who lives in Torbay, Devon, and owns a crime museum in nearby Paignton where Bronson memorabilia is on display, insists that next week’s hearings are ‘the nearest Charlie has ever got to being released into society’.

He has set up a Just Giving page to raise money to buy Bronson’s longed-for caravan home and has so far raised nearly £3,500 of his £25,000 target.

On the eve of his long-awaited parole hearing, then, the Bronson merry-go-round is turning faster than ever.

For wherever Bronson is, trouble never appears to be far away.

Whether or not the Parole Board think he is ready for release remains to be seen, but perhaps the wider question is whether Bronson, who speaks so nostalgically of his prison days, of his friendships with the likes of the Kray twins and those behind the Great Train Robbery, will ever be able to cope with a quiet life by the sea.";True;0;0.9092928171157837;high_neg;0

Mizzy has made himself famous by posting videos on TikTok showing him entering uninvited into the houses of strangers, stealing an elderly lady's dog in a park, making fun of Orthodox Jews and going up to young girls in late night train stations, stroking their hair and asking them if they want to die.

His defence is that he is actually asking them if they 'want to dye' and anyway; 'I'm a black man doing these things and that is why there is such uproar on the internet.'

This is the level of idiocy we are dealing with; this is the sea of malicious delinquency into which we have sunk. Mizzy — real name Bacari-Bronze O'Garro from Hackney, East London — won't even acknowledge that his victims are vulnerable citizens being terrified by his actions.

Clearly, he has no idea of how, for example, young women feel; of their constant stranger-danger awareness, daily harassments and necessarily fragile trust in the world. And if he did, he wouldn't care.

Mizzy — real name Bacari-Bronze O'Garro from Hackney, East London — won't even acknowledge that his victims are vulnerable citizens being terrified by his actions

He and his teenage accomplices have the cocksure faith of those who know there will be little consequence for their actions in an adult world cowed into submission by politically-correct concerns and the perennial threat of being sent to woke jail.

Dear God, what has become of us? Everyone is so scared of this generation of cultural despots that the little horrors are being allowed to run riot.

Here we all are, taking great pains to respect their pronouns, examine our unconscious bias, worry about our inherited privileges while coddling their half-baked beliefs about oil or history or James Bond and protecting them from any thoughts, books, films, songs, cartoons, language, ideas or behaviours they might find triggering — and what do we get in return? Someone like Mizzy.

For O'Garro it's all a huge joke, but his genuinely scared victims didn't know that. In the moment, they don't know if he and his gang are armed with iPhones or 9-in knives. If their intentions were noble, criminal or none of the above.

If anyone came up to me on a station platform late at night, touched my hair and asked me if I wanted to die, I think I actually would die — of sheer fright.

And note again that the victims he chooses are invariably the softest of soft targets; young girls, unworldly Jewish scholars, little old ladies sitting on park benches.

I'd like to see him ask a bunch of scaffolders on a Bermondsey building site if they 'want to die'.

I'd like to see him attempt to steal Knuckles Headlock's pet dobermann from the car park of The Flying Bottle.

I'd like to see him walk uninvited into the home of the kind of person who'd give him a kick up the backside for his troubles, even if I am not the kind of person who condones violence.

In court on Wednesday, O'Garro was given a two-year Criminal Behaviour Order and had to pay £365 in fines and costs. Not much of a deterrent, as he acknowledged himself.

'UK laws are weak, simple as,' he said on the Piers Morgan show on TalkTV that evening, displaying as much repentance as a cat deep in a vat of double cream. And of course he wasted no time in complaining yet again that he was the victim of racial prejudice and accused the host of racism.

'Why would I care what colour your skin is? I just think you're an idiot,' said Piers, and it was hard to argue.

For there is something about Mizzy and his antics that is absolutely enraging, utterly infuriating — but it is not because, like Ali G, he 'is black'.

It is more that his practical 'jokes' are so disrespectful to innocent people; so engineered to cause maximum alarm and distress — and all to engender clicks and laffs on social media.

Where is the decency, the respect for the boundaries of others, the humanity? Nowhere in sight. Yet while Mizzy feeds off the fear of the blameless, woe betide anyone who fails to respect him.

It would be nice to dismiss O'Garro as just another teenage dirtbag were it not for the fact that he represents something terrible about the casual depravity of online culture; a world in which the depersonalisation of others can lead to the aggrandisation of their tormentors.

How soon before Mizzy is in the reality show jungle, a panellist on 8 Out Of 10 Cats or making a guest appearance on the Billy Bragg stage at Glastonbury?

He also represents the kind of entitled, selfish, post-pandemic youngsters who seem to have no respect for their elders or anyone else.

It is more that his practical 'jokes' are so disrespectful to innocent people; so engineered to cause maximum alarm and distress — and all to engender clicks and laffs on social media

Where is the decency, the respect for the boundaries of others, the humanity? Nowhere in sight

Part of the blame for this surely must lie with an education system that has also been shaped by fashionable thinking and finds itself unable to exert any kind of meaningful discipline on its charges.

Instead of being reprimanded for bad behaviour, mollycoddled pupils today are merely told they made the wrong choices.

Teachers who do try to impose discipline and strictness have been dismissed as bullies for their trouble.

His mother apparently despairs, but couldn't she have done more to control her son? It's not the first time he has been in trouble with the police, after all.

And despite his lawyer's claims in court that O'Garro is repentant and won't repeat his offending, the TikTok pest is already boasting of making new films — and that the police can do nothing to stop him.

The terrible thing is, he has a point. If going around acting like an idiot and frightening people were crimes, then most of our recent intake of prime ministers would be in jail.

Anyway, this has all upset me more than it should. Not least because he seems like a bright but deluded kid who is just making a mess of his life, simple as.";True;0;0.9088582396507263;high_neg;0

Buckingham Palace will breathe a sigh of relief after the Princess of Wales' uncle, Gary Goldsmith, was evicted from the Celebrity Big Brother house last night after a week of toe-curling insider revelations, a royal expert has suggested.

The outspoken brother of Kate's mother, Carole Middleton, joined the cast of the reality TV show on Monday night, but was evicted last night as the public voted to save TV personality Lauren Simon instead.

Mr Goldsmith, 58, shared royal insight while in the Big Brother house which was said to have 'infuriated' his family as Kate Middleton recovers from abdominal surgery.

Speaking to MailOnline today, royal expert Richard Fitzwilliams suggested the news would come as a relief as the Middletons 'will have pleaded with him not to go on Big Brother', adding 'I certainly wouldn't want to be in his shoes when he and Carole Middleton next meet up!'

'Good riddance to Uncle Gary,' he said. 'He thought he could trade on his royal connections, but the public will not have forgotten his conviction for assault in 2017 despite the hype surrounding his appearance. He had nothing to offer other than mumbled platitudes.

'These were, however, embarrassing, especially during this stressful period, for the royal family. However, the public sent him to the Tower early as he proved to be an abominable No-Man.'

Mr Goldsmith, who made his money in recruitment and was once worth £30million, left the house after less than a week - but not before offering some controversial opinions on royal matters and sharing his insight into royal life.

Discussing the Sussexes, the 58-year-old said: 'I genuinely think their titles should be taken away'

Prior to his departure, it was revealed Kate's mother had harsh words for her brother before he entered the Big Brother house amid fears he could reveal secrets about the Royal Family.

An insider told The Sun: 'Gary said he's been read the riot act by Kate's mum Carole and her dad Michael.

'They aren't happy he's going into Celebrity Big Brother. It is infuriating to them. Kate doesn't need this stress.'

Asked during Monday's launch by host AJ Odudu whether the Princess of Wales would be watching, Gary joked: 'She will be hiding behind the sofa if she is watching.'

While Mr Goldsmith claimed he did not need the Firm's stamp of approval to appear on the show, it is said the Palace was watching his every move.

Among the disclosures made in the Big Brother house, Mr Goldsmith commented on his niece's health amid the torrent of speculation online.

He told presenter Fern Britton: 'She's getting the best care in the world and all the family has done is put the wagons around and look after family.

'They put a statement out that just said, ""We'll just take some time to recoup and we'll see you in Easter.""

Mr Goldsmith added: 'She's amazing, she'll be back, of course she will.'

Sharing his own opinions, Mr Goldsmith also called for Prince Harry and Meghan to be stripped of their royal titles on Tuesday night's episode.

He said: 'I genuinely think their titles should be taken away'.

Mr Goldsmith also said Meghan Markle put a 'stick in the spokes' and claimed she is creating drama.

A royal expert previously said it was unlikely the family would do anything to intervene unless Mr Goldsmith said something 'completely outrageous'.

The businessman and film producer also said that he and the Princess of Wales' mother, Carole, was a multi-millionaire by the age of 30.

On Wednesday's episode, Gary was chatting about his family with TV presenter Fern Britton when the topic of his family came up.

Although they had a humble upbringing, he said: 'We were both multi's [millionaires] by 30,' referring to him and his sister Carole.

'Really?' Fern said, sounding shocked. He nodded and said they earned their wealth from a variety of sources.

He then added: 'I get a bit narky when they say Kate’s a commoner. There's nothing common about their family.

'Look at all those posh people who are skint,' Fern said. 'With big houses,' Gary added.

The candid revelation was a shift from comments to MailOnline in 2022, when Mr Goldsmith said, on meeting William: 'Kate was a commoner, so certainly didn't fit the royal mould.

'Her maternal grandfather, my father, was a painter and decorator and her grandmother was an accounts clerk, and what they gave her was a huge work ethic.'

During his time in the house, Mr Goldsmith also admitted he wants the chance to change the public's perception of him, after always being known as the 'black sheep' of the Middleton family.

Sharon Osbourne said to him on the show: 'So, we're going to have a nice little chat Gary. Tell me why did you accept the offer to come into the house?'

Mr Goldsmith said: 'It does bother me what the public perception of me is. The black sheep of the family. I'm a normal bloke. It just so happens that my niece married Will.'

The businessman then insisted that he has no interest in being a celebrity himself.

He said: 'If I could show people I'm not that person. I've really put myself out there because this isn't my world.

'Ultimately, I'm not a celebrity. I don't want to be a celebrity, I don't want to go down that path.

Speaking in his first interview on Late & Live, Mr Goldsmith echoed the thought: 'I've had the best time, I went in with one agenda and I've achieved it in five days.

'I don't consider myself to be a celebrity, I just happen to be related to someone who is a big celebrity.'

When pressed by Louis Walsh on whether he found it difficult 'being related to famous people', Mr Goldsmith replied: 'I didn't vote for it, it happened to me, and then suddenly there's a spotlight on you.'

Discussing his thoughts about his nickname, he says: 'They call me the buncle! Have you heard of a buncle? Bad uncle, apparently every family has them.'

Mr Goldsmith has been married four times and was convicted in 2017 of assaulting his fourth wife, Julie-Ann.

He pleaded guilty to one count of assault by beating and was fined £5,000 and handed a 12-month community order with 20 sessions of rehabilitation.

'The first time I met William, Catherine was cooking, and William said, ""hi, do you want a cup of tea?"".'

In his video, Mr Goldsmith says people often consider him 'a bit of a bad boy', and that going on the show will be 'lovely to put the record straight'.

But it would appear Nigella Lawson's passionate attitude to food extends beyond her own cooking to more down-to-earth culinary pleasures.

She will now be seen this Christmas suggestively biting into a Gregg's 'festive bake' in the bakery's first ever festive advert.

Nigella, famously branded the 'Domestic Goddess' after releasing a hit cookbook about baking in the early 2000s, is the unlikely star of the bakery chain's 'playful' festive offering.

The 64-year-old, who has released numerous bestselling cookery books, is shown returning home to a house full of fairy lights and a Christmas tree decked out with Gregg's baubles.

She then goes on to enthuse about the 'rapturous riot of flavour' in the chain's 'festive bakes'.

In the advert she says: 'Succulent filling, creamy sauce, all wrapped up in the flakiest of flaky pastries, in one or both hands, say hello to the Greggs festive bakes.'She is then seen enjoying an apparent moment of bliss as she tucks into one of them.

The advert ends with a shot of a kitchen table full of items from the Greggs Christmas menu, which goes on sale this Thursday.

In recent days there have been reports that despite signing up to take part in the advert, that she did not want to endorse the chain's well-known sausage rolls.

But Greggs has insisted the claims were 'inaccurate', saying the new ad campaign with Lawson was to promote the Christmas menu.

The company added that she had never been asked to endorse its sausage rolls.

In the past she has been credited with having huge influence over shoppers with her recommendations.

Sales of goose fat doubled at Waitrose and Tesco in 2006 after she had recommended using it for roast potatoes.

When she used prunes in one of her recipes for Nigela's Christmas Kitchen, Waitrose reported sales of dried fruit had rocketed by 30 per cent.

Lawson said of the new advert: 'As a longtime fan of Greggs, and especially their sausage rolls, I'm thrilled to be collaborating with them to celebrate the return of the iconic Christmas menu.

'Greggs brings joy wherever and whenever you choose to enjoy it, and I'm delighted to be sharing this with the nation this Christmas.'Lawson released her first cookbook How To Eat in 1998.

https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/dec/05/conor-mcgregor-political-run-ireland-mma-ufc;Conor McGregor isn’t the first MMA star to flirt with the right;"In response to a comment from a right-wing influencer last week, Elon Musk appeared to endorse the idea of Conor McGregor – the former UFC champion – running for political office in Ireland.

“Not a bad idea,” Musk posted to his 164 million followers.

The billionaire, who also criticized Ireland’s taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, claiming that “the Irish PM hates the Irish people,” is the latest in a series of controversial figures to endorse McGregor in the wake of the riot that took place in Dublin last month.

Much of that support came after Irish police began investigating various social media accounts for “hate speech” to determine whether they incited the chaotic events that resulted in shops being looted, vehicles set ablaze, and anti-immigrant thugs clashing with officers. McGregor is reportedly among the figures being investigated.

“Ireland, we are at war,” McGregor posted the night before the riots.

As rioters descended on Dublin following rumors that a knife attack that left three children hospitalized was committed by an immigrant of Arab descent, McGregor continued to stoke tensions, asserting that “we are not backing down, we are only warming up. We are not losing any more of our women and children to sick and twisted people who should not even be in Ireland in the first place.” In a separate post, he added: “You reap what you sow.”

McGregor subsequently stated on X that he did not “condone” the riots before hinting at a possible pivot to politics.

In response to far-right figure Paul Golding urging the UFC fighter to lead a “freedom march” in Dublin, McGregor asserted that he is “in the process of arranging. Believe me, I am way more tactical and have backing.”

He added: “There will be change in Ireland, mark my words. The change needed.” Then, on Sunday he tweeted a photo of himself with the caption: “Ireland, your president”.

This isn’t the first time that McGregor has hinted at his interest in politics. When asked by TMZ Sports in 2018 whether he was considering the move, he said: “Maybe, who knows?! I know they’re shakin’ in their boots anyway!”

It’s important to note that any talk from McGregot about running for office should be taken with a pinch of salt: his recent interest in politics could be merely his latest ploy to gain attention. But he has remained vocal about the Irish government’s handling of immigration. He claimed that the incumbent government makes him “ashamed to be Irish” and urged his fellow citizens to demand change. His approach suggests that he no longer has faith in the government or Varadkar, and that he may be throwing his hat in the ring.

On the surface, it is difficult to imagine McGregor being taken seriously as a political candidate in Ireland. Then again, that’s why they said about Donald Trump in the US. The MMA star’s career has been plagued with scandal. He pleaded guilty to disorderly conduct for his role in an attack on a bus at a UFC event in 2018, was fined for punching a man in a Dublin pub in 2019, and has faced several allegations of sexual assault and indecent exposure, none of which have resulted in criminal charges.

Yet McGregor has found a way to leverage anti-immigrant tensions and diminishing faith in his government’s policies to resonate with a subset of Irish conservatives, as well as the far-right community around the world. The UFC fighter’s comments have been defended by the likes of Chaya Raichik, the woman behind the anti-LGBTQ+ social media account Libs of TikTok, US based white supremacist Nick Fuentes, and American conspiracy theory website Infowars, among others.

And McGregor wouldn’t be the first UFC fighter to pivot to rightwing politics.

In 2020, former UFC champion and QAnon adherent Tito Ortiz won a seat on the Huntington Beach city council in California, becoming mayor pro tem of the city, a largely ceremonial role that would have required Ortiz to step in if the mayor became incapacitated. He resigned less than a year later following a series of controversies.

Two years later, former UFC lightweight champion BJ Penn launched a campaign to win the Republican nomination for governor of Hawaii. He lost by a significant margin but refused to accept defeat despite the Hawaii supreme court dismissing his election complaint.

Most recently, former UFC heavyweight Alistair Overeem ran for a seat in the Netherlands’ House of Representatives as a member of the right-wing populist Belang van Nederland party in 2023. Neither he, nor the party won any seats in parliament.

Numerous UFC fighters have actively supported right-wing populist leaders such as Trump and former Brazilian leader Jair Bolsonaro. And several MMA fighters, including legendary heavyweight Fedor Emelianenko, have campaigned for Vladimir Putin, while other Russian fighters (including a handful in the UFC) have publicly supported their country’s invasion of Ukraine.

McGregor, too, has endorsed such controversial figures, labeling Putin as “one of the greatest leaders of our time” and hailing Trump as a “phenomenal president.”

While McGregor is part of an ongoing trend of MMA fighters pivoting to right-wing activism and politics, he would also be one of the most popular and influential fighters to make the switch, making him a potential threat to the current establishment.

McGregor has more than 58 million followers on his social media platforms and was once the highest paid athlete in the world. His wealth and influence ensures that he would have the resources to fund his ambition and an unrivalled platform to reach his audience.

The 35-year-old already appears to be switching tactics following his incendiary social media posts, focusing instead on messages of reform. In a statement to the Guardian last week, McGregor said that he did not condone violence and is “praying that the streets will remain calm and peaceful. We Irish are known for our beautiful hearts, and we have a proud history of not accepting racism.” But he also called on the government to reform Ireland’s immigration and refugee policies and that officials needed to act “in the best interest of Irish citizens.”

In a post on X last week, McGregor also accused the government of using him as a “scapegoat” to distract from recent events: “if it makes you feel better, I will take it,” he wrote.

It remains to be seen whether McGregor will leverage his newfound political clout into a run for office, and the political and social landscape is very different from that of the United States. And much of the support thrown his way appears to be from outside Ireland. Yet as far-right activists continue to fuel angst related to crime and immigration, the potential for the fighter to emerge as a prominent figurehead for their populist movement seems increasingly likely.";True;1;0.935575544834137;high_pos;0

An Obama-appointed judge presiding over Donald Trump's quest to block the release of more than 700 pages of White House documents to the Democrat-led House committee investigating the Capitol riot is weighing a ruling that could potentially be a win for the firmer president.

US District Judge Tanya Chutkan appeared on Thursday to back the Biden administration's decision to waive executive privilege over the documents, but conceded that 'there has to be some limit' on what House lawmakers can ask for, according to reports after the hearing.

Acknowledging that the deadline for the first round of documents is coming up on November 12, Chutkan vowed to make a decision 'expeditiously.'

At one point during the proceedings, she laughed off the former president's lawyers when they were presenting their case today.

Chutkan asked Trump's attorneys for evidence to back their claim that two other probes already cleared Trump of wrongdoing.

She called it a 'rather startling' conclusion and asked, 'What's your basis for that assertion?' in reference to a legal brief they filed earlier this week.

'Just a published article from Reuters with respect to the - quoting the FBI...' the attorney explained, according to audio of the hearing obtained by RawStory.

Chutkan replied, 'You cite an article - and by the way, the article says the FBI has found scant evidence, but I mean -'

She paused for a stunned chuckle before continuing on.

'I mean, that's your only support for that statement?' she asks.

The article in question appears to be a Reuters story from late August, titled 'Exclusive: FBI finds scant evidence U.S. Capitol attack was coordinated - sources.'

Chutkan was handed the case at random last month. She's known for handing down harsh words and harsher sentences to people who participated in the Capitol riot, once denouncing them from the bench as a 'violent mob.'

The case will test the bounds of executive privilege, which the ex-president successfully invoked as a defense in past probes while he was commander-in-chief.

Trump has denounced the House's investigation as a 'witch hunt' and claims he should have control over the release of his White House files

Chutkan is hearing Trump's lawyers explain why they believe the National Archives should be blocked from releasing his executive records.

She could issue the highly-anticipated ruling as early as this afternoon.

Trump has denounced the House select committee's investigation of January 6 as a 'witch hunt' and argued that he should have sole control over access to the records of his White House.

The files, which could include phone records, visitor logs, speech drafts and memos of Trump and his closest aides, have the potential to be groundbreaking for the bipartisan House probe.

The National Archives has already agreed to hand over the documents, and Joe Biden's White House said it would not stand in the way.

Lawmakers led by Democratic Committee Chair Rep. Bennie Thompson of Mississippi and Republican Vice Chair Rep. Liz Cheney of Wyoming have sought to paint the documents as critical to their probe.

'In 2021, for the first time since the Civil War, the Nation did not experience a peaceful transfer of power,' committee lawyers said over the weekend, according to CNN.

Lawmakers led by Democratic Committee Chair Rep. Bennie Thompson and Republican Vice Chair Rep. Liz Cheney have argued the documents are critical to their probe

They argued, 'A peaceful transfer of power from one President to another is crucial to the continuation of our democratic government. It is difficult to imagine a more critical subject for Congressional investigation, and Mr. Trump's arguments cannot overcome that pressing legislative need.'

Trump's lawyers told Chutkan's court this week, 'Permitting the expansive request here would harm future presidents and their close aides by allowing invasive congressional fishing expeditions that will certainly chill candid advice and harm the institution of the presidency.'

Among the records they're trying to block are files from ex-White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows, who was subpoenaed by House investigators in September.

They also include call logs between Trump and Vice President Mike Pence, who was forced into hiding at the Capitol while the ex-president's supporters broke in.

Ex-White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany's binders containing 2020 election talking points and documents belonging to adviser Stephen Miller are also on the list.

Chutkan, whose decision today could either make or break the House investigation, called the Capitol rioters as a 'violent mob seeking to overthrow the lawfully elected government' during the sentencing hearing of one participant, Matthew Mazzocco, who she sentenced to 45 days in jail despite prosecutors not recommending any incarceration.

Chutkan has been known to hand down harsh sentences to Capitol rioters appearing in her courtroom

The 59-year-old judge was appointed by Barack Obama in 2013.

Public records show she donated around $2,200 to Obama in 2008, when she was a partner at Boies Schiller Flexner.

Already Chutkan is known for handing down sentences of at least 14 days for Capitol riot defendants who've entered her courtroom.

During the sentencing hearing of Capitol rioter Mazzocco, she condemned the Trump supporters as a 'very real danger' to democracy, CNN reported.

Prosecutors recommended home confinement for Mazzocco's misdemeanor charge but Chutkan reportedly disagreed.

'There have to be consequences for participating in an attempted violent overthrow of the government, beyond sitting at home,' she said in court.

Chutkan said the rioters had 'soiled and defaced the halls of the Capitol.'

She went after Trump directly when she said Mazzocco didn't go to the Capitol on January 6 'out of any love for our country.'

'He went for one man,' the judge said

She also slammed comparisons to earlier Black Lives Matter protests in DC.

'To compare the actions of people around the country protesting, mostly peacefully, for civil rights, to a violent mob seeking to overthrow the lawfully elected government is a false equivalency and downplays the very real danger that the crowd on January 6 posed to our democracy.' Chutkan said.

An earlier case of Chutkan's made headlines in 2019 when she sentenced Russian spy Maria Butina to 18 months in prison for conspiring to infiltrate the National Rifle Association. That sentence was in line with the government's recommendation.";True;1;0.9349172115325928;high_pos;0
https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-10523277/Insane-prison-riot-Wellington-NSW-caught-CCTV.html;Insane prison riot in Wellington, NSW caught on CCTV;"Shocking CCTV footage from a riot involving hundreds of prisoners inside one of Australia's toughest jails has been revealed, as guards say they received rape and death threats by crazed criminals.

Wellington Correctional Centre in New South Wales' central-west erupted on April 11, 2020 after a cell fire saw officers move about 40 inmates into the recreation yard.

There they wreaked havoc, creating weapons out of anything they could find and encouraging prisoners in other blocks to join in on the carnage.

It kicked off a four-hour siege that saw guards injured, a criminal climb onto the roof of the jail and help brought in from surrounding facilities to end the riot.

'They made threats to kill officers, they made threats to rape female officers. It was violent, it was brutal,' an officer named India told Nine's Australia Behind Bars.

Shocking CCTV footage from a riot involving hundreds of prisoners inside one of Australia's hardest prisons has been revealed (pictured), where detainees fashioned weapons out of anything they could find

Wellington Correctional Centre (pictured) in New South Wales' central-west erupted on April 11, 2020 after a cell fire saw officers move about 40 inmates into the recreation yard

The 'Battle of Wellington' kicked off on the morning of Easter Saturday at the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic.

Inmates were on edge after staff had cancelled all in-person visits due to fears surrounding the virus, with officers believing it may have cut off their access to narcotics.

'Some inmates ask friends and wives to bring in drugs for them. I think inmates were in a detox stage and that escalated the riot,' an officer named Daniel said.

A fire was discovered in a cell in D-block, forcing guards to move criminals into the yard. There they tore apart barbecues, ripped doors off hinges and found whatever else they could to use as weapons.

Fired-up inmates started smashing at windows and walls while others threatened to murder and rape guards.

'We had four or five hundred inmates rebelling at the same time,' officer Daniel said.

'They were starting to arm up with whatever they could get. They feed off each other, they gang together, they just erupt.'

'They made threats to kill officers, they made threats to rape female officers. It was violent, it was brutal,' an officer named India (pictured) told Nine's Australia Behind Bars

Officers eventually fired chemical munitions to subdue the rioting criminals and end the siege

The guard said he was shocked to see prisoners he had a good relationship with now saying they wanted him dead.

'Inmates I was just talking to were telling me they were going to kill me. I said ""are you kidding me? We were just joking around and now you want to kill me?""

'There's no negotiating. There was nothing else we could do other than using force.'

An inmate then managed to climb onto the roof of the prison, with other criminals giving him rocks and other objects to pelt at officer Daniel.

The guard was forced to shelter behind walls and other buildings as prisoners directed the man on the roof to where he was hiding.

'I got hit a couple of times. I sprinted up to the gate. We had to shelter ourselves,' he said.

'The officer who was with me had blood coming out of his leg pretty bad.'

The entire facility was placed on a full lockdown, with D-block prisoners yelling at the C-block to 'burn it down'.

An inmate then managed to climb onto the roof of the prison, with other criminals giving him rocks and other objects to pelt at officer Daniel

Specialist crews were brought from around the state, including teams from Lithgow and Macquarie Correctional Centre.

Dog squads and trained riot units were brought in and armed with tear gas, which was fired into the yards to subdue the violence.

Some inmates attempted to throw the chemical munitions back at the guards, but eventually they were all rendered powerless.

After taking control of D-block, hundreds officers in full riot gear moved in, isolating each inmate one by one and moving them into their respective cells.

The search was then on for the inmate who had climbed onto the roof and was attacking office Daniel and others with rocks.

He was eventually located hiding under his bed in his cell.

The riot ended up lasting for three hours and 45 minutes, with $119,000 worth of damage being caused.

Inmates were placed in a three-week lockdown as a punishment, only allowed to leave their cells for one hour per day with no electricity and no television

One prisoner told the program they were subsequently punished with three weeks of lockdown, only allowed to leave their cells for one hour per day.

They also had electricity removed from their cells, with no TV privileges for the entire period.

Courts imposed extension onto some prisoners' sentences, while others received four-month good behaviour orders.

'I'm glad everyone is going to hear about our Easter riot and for Wellington to receive the recognition we deserve for gaining control of our centre,' officer India said.

'It's about time people hear about it.'";True;1;0.9272856712341309;high_pos;0

A day after he refused a request by House investigators to provide information about his conversations with Trump, McCarthy shrugged off questions at his regular news conference.

Instead he attacked House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and the record of the Biden administration.

'My conversation was very short advising the president what was happening here,' he said of his Jan. 6 call with the president.

'There is nothing that I can provide the January six committee for legislation ... moving forward.

'There is nothing in that realm. It is pure politics of what they're playing.'

Yet in an interview with his hometown newspaper in the aftermath of the violence he characterized the call differently.

House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy bristled at questions on Thursday about why he would not cooperate with the Jan. 6 investigation, turning instead to attack House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and saying he had nothing to offer the House probe

Last year McCarthy said he had a 'very heated' conversation with President Trump as the violence unfolded and he urged him to 'get help' to the Capitol. On Thursday, he said their conversation was 'very short' and that it would not help the investigating committee

McCarthy admitted last year he said he would help the committee's investigation, but that was before it became clear that Pelosi was playing politics with it

He told the Bakersfield Californian they had a 'very heated conversation as the riot was taking place and that he urged the president to 'get help' to the Capitol.

Those comments were central to a letter sent by committee chair Bennie Thompson on Thursday asking for more information.

McCarthy rejected that request on Wednesday evening, saying the panel was not 'conducting a legitimate investigation.'

That set the stage for a combustible atmosphere at the House minority leader's weekly news conference.

Reporters quizzed McCarthy about why he had publicly criticized Trump after the riot - saying he 'bears responsibility' - before changing his tune after a meeting at the former president's Florida home.

McCarthy claimed he did not single out Trump.

'My criticism went to everyone on that day: Why was the capital so ill prepared that day? ... And how do we make sure it will never be ill prepared again.'

He described a meeting with the head of Capitol Police with lawmakers this week and hinted that Pelosi was to blame for hobbling officers' efforts.

'Some of the questions that were asked to the Capitol Police, the chief said that was above his pay grade to make the answer,' said McCarthy.

'I asked him well, who's above you?'

He was also asked why he said in May last year he would provide testimony to the committee investigating the attack, but had apparently changed his mind.

McCarthy said that was two months before Pelosi set down the rules of the committee so that the minority could not appoint their selected individuals.

'So when you asked me that question, never did I think a speaker would play such politics and then appoint a chairman who starts the committee by saying the only person out of bounds is the speaker,' he said.

'Maybe if Nancy Pelosi had done what other speakers would do, and not play politics with it. It could have been a different answer.'

Critics within his own party have already accused the House minority leader of trying to cover up what really happened on Jan. 6.

Rep. Liz Cheney, one of the few Republicans to openly criticize Trump for his role in the violence and one of only two GOP members of the committee, told CNN: 'I wish that he were a brave and honorable man.

'He's clearly trying to cover up what happened. He has an obligation to come forward, and we'll get to the truth.'

Committee chairman Bennie Thompson wrote to McCarthy on Wednesday asking for help with various topics, including his conversations with the president 'before, during and after' the riot

Trump has encouraged his former aides and allies not to cooperate with the probe.

McCarthy is seeking Trump's help in winning control of the House in this year's midterm election and becoming the next speaker.

The panel has already interviewed about 300 people and issued subpoenas to more than 40 as it seeks to create a comprehensive record of the Jan. 6 attack.

In his letter, Thompson said he wanted McCarthy's help in gathering information about his conversations with the president 'before, during and after' the riot as lawmakers try to understand Trump's motivations.

He went on to point out that McCarthy himself had said publicly that the president bore responsibility.

'Further, you shared an account of your communications with President Trump with a local news outlet in your district, which reported that you had a “very heated conversation” with the President as the riot was taking place, and urged the President to “get help” to the Capitol,' wrote Thompson.

'Many similar reports appear on and after January 6th from a number of other news organizations.

'And, in addition to all of those published accounts — which each appear consistent with your public statements at the time — Politico reported that you shared an even greater degree of detail with your colleagues in a widely attended conference call on January 11th.

'On that call, according to the report, you stated that President Trump had admitted “some degree of responsibility” for January 6th in his one-on-one conversations with you.'";True;1;0.9441284537315369;high_pos;0
https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/dec/16/jim-jordan-texts-capitol-attack-trump-mark-meadows;Congressman Jim Jordan sent text to Mark Meadows saying Pence could block election result;"The Ohio congressman Jim Jordan has been identified as the Republican who sent a message to Donald Trump’s chief of staff Mark Meadows the day before the deadly 6 January US Capitol riots outlining a plan to stop Joe Biden – the legitimate winner of the presidential election – from reaching the White House.

The House select committee investigating the insurrection has been looking at numerous messages sent to Meadows on and around that day, many of which were from Trump supporters urging the then-president to call off a mob of his supporters as they ransacked the Capitol building.

Meadows, whose role in events has become a central plank of the investigation, and who provided many of the messages to the committee, is facing possible contempt of Congress charges for withdrawing his cooperation.

Jordan, a staunch Trump ally whom Republicans originally wanted to sit on the committee, forwarded a text message to Meadows on 5 January, one of the congressman’s aides has confirmed, containing details of the plot to block Biden.

The message was sent to Jordan by Joseph Schmitz, a former US defense department inspector general who outlined a “draft proposal” to pressure vice-president Mike Pence to refuse to certify audited election returns on 6 January.

A portion of the message was shown by Democratic committee member Adam Schiff on Tuesday. It read: “On January 6, 2021, Vice-President Mike Pence, as president of the Senate, should call out all electoral votes that he believes are unconstitutional as no electoral votes at all.”

The plotters falsely believed Pence had the constitutional authority to reject the election results and allow rival slates of electors from Republicans in states that Biden won to decide the outcome. Pence refused to do so, and has since been castigated by Trump and his allies.

Jordan was one of five Republicans rejected from serving on the committee by Nancy Pelosi, the House speaker, who instead appointed Trump critics Liz Cheney and Adam Kinzinger. Some commentators say the move “saved” the committee’s integrity.

The panel has accelerated its inquiries in recent days and weeks, issuing dozens of subpoenas, interviewing more than 300 witnesses and reviewing more than 30,000 documents as it attempts to tie Trump to the events of 6 January.

A clearer picture has emerged of the involvement of Trump loyalists, including senior Republican party officials such as Jordan, in the coup attempt, with questions swirling this week particularly over the role of Meadows.

Trump’s former chief of staff is revealed to have received numerous messages on the day of the riot from Republican politicians, Fox News television personalities such as Sean Hannity and Laura Ingraham, and the president’s son Donald Trump Jr.

The text from Trump Jr was succinct. “We need an Oval address. He has to lead now. It has gone too far and gotten out of hand. He’s got to condemn this shit asap.”

Meadows replied: “I’m pushing it hard. I agree.”

Schiff, a California Democrat who led the prosecution in the Senate at Trump’s first impeachment in January 2020, has argued that Meadows was at the heart of the pressure campaign on Pence, and voted for him to face contempt charges for his refusal to explain it.

“You can see why this is so critical to ask Mr Meadows about,” Schiff said during the committee’s presentation on Tuesday.

“About a lawmaker suggesting that the former vice-president simply throw out votes that he unilaterally deems unconstitutional in order to overturn a presidential election and subvert the will of the American people.”";True;1;0.8863201141357422;high_pos;0

In his first public remarks since Wednesday's MAGA storming of the Capitol, the president slammed Democrats, accusing them of creating 'tremendous danger' with their attempt to remove him from office but said repeatedly he wanted 'no violence.'

The president defended his speech at a rally on ellipse, where he encouraged his thousands of supporters to 'march' on the Capitol.

They did so, leaving five dead and a path of destruction in their wake in the form of busted windows, broken furniture and destroyed office space. Dozens have now been rounded up by police and FBI.

'If you read my speech - and many people have done it and I've seen it both in the papers and in the media, on television, it is been analyzed - and people thought that what I said was totally appropriate,' he said as he boarded Air Force One to head for Alamo, Texas, on the Mexican border, to inspect his wall.

'They've analyzed my speech and my words and my final paragraph, my final sentence and everybody to a tee thought it was totally appropriate,' he continued. He offered no indication of who 'they' are.

Trump also denounced the Democrats' efforts to remove him from office, which has been joined by some Republicans, to remove him from office - and called it a 'danger,' not his supporters' actions.

But, he said he wanted no violence from his supporters. Trump reportedly had initially enjoyed the sight of his supporters on Capitol Hill last week, fighting for him to illegally take a second term in the White House. He changed his tune and called on them to stand down when he warned he could be held legally responsible for their actions.

'We want no violence, never violence. We want absolutely no violence,' he said repeatedly Tuesday before he left for Texas to tout the completion of a section of his border wall.

'And on the impeachment, it's really a continuation of the greatest witch hunt in the history of politics. It's ridiculous. It's absolutely ridiculous. This impeachment is causing tremendous anger,' he said.

He denounced Democratic leaders but made no mention of the Republicans who have called on him to leave office.

'It's really a terrible thing that they're doing for Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer to continue on this path. I think it's causing tremendous danger to our country, and it's causing tremendous anger, I want no violence,' he said.

Speaker Nancy Pelosi arrives in the Capitol Tuesday ahead of a vote in the House calling on Vice President Mike Pence to use the 25th amendment to remove President Trump from office

Later Tuesday, the House will vote on legislation calling on Vice President Mike Pence to start the process to remove Trump via the 25th amendment.

Speaker Nancy Pelosi set an ultimatum Monday that if Trump does not resign or Pence does not invoke the 25th Amendment, the House will move forward with impeaching the president for a second time.

The House will hold a vote Tuesday evening on a non-binding demand that Pence invoke the 25th Amendment.

Pence's advisers say he is opposed to this measure, indicating he will likely not move forward with meeting pressures from congressional Democrats in Trump's final eight days.

Republicans who have publicly broken with Trump since Wednesday's Capitol riots Sen. Pat Toomey (Pa.) Said Trump 'committed impeachable offenses.' Sen. Mitt Romney (Utah) Said the president had caused 'this insurrection.' Sen. Lisa Murkowski (Alaska) Called on Trump to resign. ' I want him out.' Rep. Liz Cheney (Wyo.) Said Trump 'caused' the riot and called his response 'completely inadequate' Rep. Adam Kinzinger (Ill.) Called for Trump to resign and called 25th Amendment the 'next best thing.' Said he would 'vote the right way' on impeachment, without endorsing the tactic. Rep. Peter Meijer (Mich.) Said fellow Republicans told 'lied' and 'deceived' and called what happened an 'act of domestic terrorism' Advertisement

The House could vote as early as Wednesday at 9 a.m. on articles of impeachment. Republicans are not doing a 'whip count' - meaning leadership will not be arm twisting their members to support Trump. Instead top GOP officials said lawmakers should vote their conscious.

Pelosi told '60 Minutes' in an interview that aired Sunday that she prefers the 25th Amendment because that forces immediate removal, while impeachment wouldn't be resolved before Trump's term is up.

She fears Trump could use his final days to do more damage – like pardoning the mob who stormed the Capitol.

The Senate is in recess, and Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said they would not reconvene earlier than January 19 to receive articles from the House.

This means even if the lower chamber did elevate impeachment, action wouldn't be taken on the measure until the day before Joe Biden's inauguration at the earliest.

Trump's refusal to accept responsibility for Wednesday is likely to only anger further Democrats, but it is the Republican House and Senate caucus' reactions which will set his fate.

Some Republicans have already called for him to go but none has so far publicly backed impeachment.

Lindsey Graham, who claimed he was 'done' with the president last week, appeared to have had a dramatic change of heart and was traveling with him on Air Force One.

But others have privately said they need to see Trump take some responsibility, meaning his refusal could drive them into the Democrats' camp on impeachment.

Republicans are emerging from Trump's presidency deeply divided and the impeachment vote could scar the party even more.

Trump's allies, including his son Donald Trump Jr., are threatening to primary any Republican who does not support the president.

Meanwhile, a group of former administration officials and anti-Trump Republicans - calling themselves the the Republican Accountability Project - said they would make a $50 million commitment to support GOP lawmakers who voted for Trump's impeachment, The New York Times reported.

Trump also road-tested a defense for his impeachment in his remarks on Tuesday.

At the end of Trump's remarks, he appeared to reference guidance he has received from attorneys and aides about the content of his Wednesday speech – which form the basis for the impeachment article charging him with 'incitement of insurrection.'

His comment follows reports that White House counsel Pat Cipollone had warned Trump that he faces potential legal exposure for the remarks he made to the crowd that went on to storm the Capitol.

Although Trump did not specifically tell anyone to break a window or trespass, he did tell them to 'fight,' that 'when you catch somebody in a fraud, you are allowed to go by very different rules,' that 'we're going to have to fight much harder,' and that 'if you don't fight like hell, you're not going to have a country anymore.'

He also spoke as if Vice President Pence could make a difference in the outcome. 'If Mike Pence does the right thing, we win the election,' Trump said - meaning overturning the Electoral College results, which Pence said he did not have the power to do.

The final substantive paragraph, which he defended, told his supporters that 'we' would march to the Capitol to 'take back our country.'

'So we are going to walk down Pennsylvania Avenue - I love Pennsylvania Avenue - and we are going to the Capitol.,' he said.

'And we are going to try and give — the Democrats are hopeless, they are never voting for anything, not even one vote — but we are going to try to give our Republicans — the weak ones because the strong ones don't need any of our help — going to try and give them the kind of pride and boldness that they need to take back our country,' Trump said. 'So let's walk down Pennsylvania Avenue.'

He in fact returned to the White House.

Trump's initial response to the MAGA riot was to release a video message where he told his followers he loved them.

'We love you, you're very special,' he said in the short video posted to his Twitter account, which was still active at the time.

And he reiterated his original message, which had helped incite the mob, that the election had been stolen.

'I know your pain, I know you're hurt. We had an election that was stolen from us. It was a landslide election and everyone knows it. Especially the other side. But you have to go home now. We have to have peace,' he said.

His message appeared to have no effect on the mob, who was heard yelling for Vice President Pence and Speaker Nancy Pelosi.

The day after the riots, Trump released a second video message where he acknowledged a 'new administration' was coming into the White House but he didn't congratulate President-elect Joe Biden nor even mention his name. He also denounced the mob.

'Those who violently besieged our Capitol, are the opposite of everything this administration stands for. The core value of our administration is the idea that all citizens have the right to live and safety, peace and freedom. Those who are working in this building are working to ensure an orderly transition of power. Now it is time for America to unites to come together to reject the violence that we have seen, we are one American people, full, under God,' he said.

What Trump told supporters before they ransacked the Capitol in 'totally appropriate' speech

We're going to have to fight much harder 'Republicans are constantly fighting like a boxer with his hands tied behind his back. It's like a boxer. And we want to be so nice. We want to be so respectful of everybody, including bad people. And we're going to have to fight much harder.' We're going to walk down to the Capitol 'We're going to walk down to the Capitol, and we're going to cheer on our brave senators and congressmen and women, and we're probably not going to be cheering so much for some of them, because you'll never take back our country with weakness. You have to show strength, and you have to be strong. 'Get tougher' / You are allowed to go by very different rules 'The Republicans have to get tougher. You’re not going to have a Republican Party if you don’t get tougher. They want to play so straight. They want to play so serious. “The United States, the Constitution doesn’t allow me to send them back to the states.” Well, I would say yes, it does, because the Constitution says you have to protect our country, and you have to protect our Constitution, and you can’t vote on fraud, and fraud breaks up everything, doesn’t it? When you catch somebody in a fraud, you are allowed to go by very different rules. So I hope Mike has the courage to do what he has to do, and I hope he doesn’t listen to the RINOs and the stupid people that he’s listening toWhen you catch somebody in a fraud, you are allowed to go by very different rules. So I hope Mike has the courage to do what he has to do, and I hope he doesn't listen to the RINOs and the stupid people that he's listening to.' Takes 'more courage not to step up' 'I also want to thank our 13 most courageous members of the U.S. Senate ... I actually think, though, it takes, again, more courage not to step up, and I think a lot of those people are going to find that out. And you better start looking at your leadership, because your leadership has led you down the tubes.' Never concede 'We will never give up. We will never concede. It doesn't happen. You don't concede when there's theft involved. Our country has had enough.' On 'fake news' and 'Big tech' 'They rigged an election, they rigged it like they have never rigged an election before.' 'All of us here today do not want to see our election victory stolen by bold and radical left Democrats, which is what they are doing, and stolen by the fake news media. That is what they have done and what they are doing. We will never give up. We will never concede. It doesn’t happen. You don’t concede when there’s theft involved.' 'We will not take it anymore' 'Our country has had enough. We will not take it anymore, and that is what this is all about.' And to use a favorite term that all of you people really came up with, we will stop the steal.'

Denied Biden's vote count 'He had 80 million computer votes. It’s a disgrace. There’s never been anything like that. You can take Third World countries, just take a look, take Third World countries, their elections are more honest than what we have been going through in this country. It’s a disgrace. It’s a disgrace. Even when you look at last night, they were all running around like chickens with their heads cut off with boxes, and nobody knows what the hell is going on. There’s never been anything like this. We will not let them silence your voices. We’re not going to let it happen.' [Note: Biden got more than 81 million votes; Trump rounded up his own total to 75 million.] Call for military and law enforcement to join 'And I would love to have, if those tens of thousands of people would be allowed, the military, the Secret Service and we want to thank you — and the police and law enforcement — great, you’re doing a great job. But I would love it if they could be allowed to come up with us. Is that possible? Can you just let them, please?' Pressure on Mike Pence: Says it takes 'courage' to do nothing 'I hope Mike is going to do the right thing. I hope so. I hope so because if Mike Pence does the right thing, we win the election ... All Vice President Pence has to do is send it back to the states to re-certify, and we become president, and you are the happiest people.' 'And I actually, I just spoke to Mike. I said, Mike, that doesn’t take courage, what takes courage is to do nothing. That takes courage, and then we are stuck with a president who lost the election by a lot, and we have to live with that for four more years. We’re just not going to let that happen.' Won't stand for Biden win 'We want to go back, and we want to get this right, because we’re going to have somebody in there that should not be in there, and our country will be destroyed. And we’re not going to stand for that.' 'You're not the people that tore down our nation' 'If this happened to the Democrats, there’d be hell all over the country going on. There’d be hell all over the country. But just remember this, you’re stronger, you’re smarter. You’ve got more going than anybody, and they try and demean everybody having to do with us, and you’re the real people. You’re the people that built this nation. You’re not the people that tore down our nation.' March peacefully ... we will see whether Republicans stand strong 'I know that everyone here will soon be marching over to the Capitol building to peacefully and patriotically make your voices heard. Today, we will see whether Republicans stand strong for the integrity of our elections. But whether or not they stand strong for our country — our country, our country has been under siege for a long time. Far longer than this four-year period' 'Ashamed ... throughout eternity' 'Today, we see a very important event, though, because right over there, right there, we see the event that’s going to take place, and I’m going to be watching because history is going to be made. We’re going to see whether or not we have great and courageous leaders or whether or not we have leaders that should be ashamed of themselves throughout history, throughout eternity. They’ll be ashamed. And you know what? If they do the wrong thing, we should never, ever forget that they did. Never forget.' Calls Republicans who voted not to count certified votes 'warriors' 'I want to thank the more than 140 members of the House. Those are warriors.15 They’re over there working like you’ve never seen before, studying, talking, actually going all the way back studying the roots of the Constitution because they know we have the right to send a bad vote that was illegally gotten.' Biden will be 'illegitimate' 'But think of this: If you don’t do that, that means you will have a president of the United States for four years with his wonderful son, you will have a president who lost all of these states, or you will have a president, to put it another way, who was voted on by a bunch of stupid people who lost all of these states. You will have an illegitimate president. That is what you will have, and we can’t let that happen.' Call to 'do something' about radical left 'The radical left knows exactly what they were doing. They are ruthless, and it’s time that somebody did something about it. And Mike Pence, I hope you’re going to stand up for the good of our Constitution and for the good of our country. (APPLAUSE) And if you’re not, I’m going to be very disappointed in you. I will tell you right now. I’m not hearing good stories.' Election was 'stolen' 'Make no mistake, this election was stolen from you, from me, and from the country, and not a single swing state has conducted a comprehensive audit to remove the illegal ballots. This should absolutely occur in every single contested state before the election is certified.' Alleges 'criminal enterprise' 'So, when you hear — when you hear, “While there is no evidence to prove any wrongdoing,” this is the most fraudulent thing anybody’s — this is a criminal enterprise. This is a criminal enterprise.' Fight like hell

'And again, most people would stand there at 9 o’clock in the evening and say, “I want to thank you very much,” and they go off to some other life. But I said something is wrong here, something is really wrong, can’t have happened, and we fight. We fight like hell, and if you don’t fight like hell you’re not going to have a country anymore.'

It is not known which group of lawyers are currently advising Trump on his role before and during the riots. Lawyer Rudy Giuliani spoke before Trump at the rally, telling participants to engage in 'trial by combat.' Lawyer Cleta Mitchell was on the line during Trump's call to ask a Georgia election official to 'find' 11,780 votes, but she resigned from her firm in the aftermath.

Trump broke his public silence after revealing his false belief that 'ANTIFA people' were behind Wednesday's riot in a private call to the most senior Republican in the House - who claimed that the president does accept some blame for the unrest that killed five people.

And he also publicly contradicted Kevin McCarthy, the fiercely loyal House Minority Leader, who told House Republicans on Monday that Trump bears some blame for last week's deadly Capitol riots and has accepted some responsibility, Politico reported, citing four Republican sources on a private call.

That left McCarthy publicly embarrassed, at a time when his caucus is splitting over what to do about Trump and donors are deserting.

Trump's abdication of responsibility came amid mounting fears that the violence is not over.

On Monday evening lawmakers were briefed by law enforcement that there were three active plots, including one involving 4,000 'armed patriots' planning to surround Congress. They had been issued with 'rules of engagement,' Conor Lamb (D-PA) told CNN - meaning when they would shoot people.

Trump on Monday declared a state of emergency in D.C. amid ratcheting tensions over violent plots which could rock Capitol Hill ahead of Biden's inauguration.

The declaration allows the Department of Homeland Security and Federal Emergency Management Agency to coordinate with local authorities as Democrats had been demanding.

Last week's chaos resulted in the deaths of four rioters and one Capitol Police officer from his wounds and the suicide of another; dozens of injuries; and extensive damage throughout the ransacked building.

McCarthy strongly pushed back against Trump's claim that the rioters were Left-wing agitators intent on discrediting Trump and his followers - a claim made by staunchly pro-Trump congressman Matt Gaetz, and repeated by Fox News' anchors and pundits.

'It's not ANTIFA, it's MAGA,' McCarthy replied, according to Axios.

Speaking again: Trump spoke to reporters as he prepared to board Air Force One for Texas, where he is inspecting his border wall

Not me: Trump denied all responsibility for the MAGA riot saying that it had been 'analyzed' and was 'appropriate.' He offered no suggestion for who provided the analysis

Is this the nuclear football? A military aide accompanied the president up the steps of Air Force one with two briefcases which appear similar to the book of command codes which Trump has access to. Late last week Nancy Pelosi sought assurances from Army General Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, that a 'deranged' president could not use them

'I know. I was there,' McCarthy said, according to a White House official and another source familiar with the call.

McCarthy later reiterated his position during a two-hour meeting with Republicans in the House, telling them there is 'undisputedly' no evidence that people linked to ANTIFA participated in the insurrection.

The theory that anti-Trump agitators stirred up the unrest has been decisively debunked. Those arrested so far for their part in the riots have in many cases a long and public history of supporting the president: none of those detained has been a supporter of ANTIFA.

Trump, during the tense 30 minute conversation with McCarthy on Monday morning, also continued to insist that the election had been stolen from him.

McCarthy, exasperated, told him: 'Stop it. It's over. The election is over.'

The ensuing chaos at the Capitol resulted in the deaths of four rioters and one Capitol Police officer; dozens of injuries; and extensive damage throughout the ransacked building. Pictured: Rioters breach the Capitol building on January 6

WHAT DOES THE 25TH AMENDMENT SAY? CAN TRUMP'S CABINET REALLY TOPPLE HIM? The 25th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution deals with presidential authority in the event of death or removal from office, and was ratified in 1967, in the wake of John F Kennedy's assassination. What does the 25th Amendment say? It is in four sections, all dealing with the president leaving office during his or her elected term. The first section states that the vice president takes over the Oval Office if the president dies or resigns – or is removed – something which the original Constitution did not clearly state. Presidents of course can be removed by impeachment, a feature of the constitution from the start. They can also be removed through the 25th Amendment - of which more below. Section II states that if the vice president dies, or resigns – or is fired – both the House and Senate have to confirm a new vice president. Until 1967, presidents could change vice presidents mid-term on their own if they got the vice president to agree to resign - not something that actually happened, but which was possible in principle. Section III makes clear that a president can temporarily delegate his powers to the vice president, and later reclaim them when he - or she - is capable of serving. This is most often invoked if a president is under the influence of surgical anesthetic for a short period of time. Section IV is the amendment's most controversial part: it describes how the president can be removed from office if he is incapacitated and does not leave on his own. The vice president and 'a majority of either the principal officers of the executive departments or of such other body as Congress may by law provide' must write to both the president pro tempore of the Senate and the Speaker of the House, saying that 'the President is unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office.' The term principal officers of the executive departments would normally mean the cabinet secretaries. So at least eight of the president's 15 most senior Cabinet members together with the vice president must agree that a president should be removed before any plan can move forward. Notifying the House Speaker and the Senate president pro tempore is the act that immediately elevates the vice president to an 'acting president' role. The deposed president can contest the claim, giving the leaders of the bloodless coup four days to re-assert their claims to the House and Senate. Congress then has two days to convene – unless it is already in session – and another 21 days to vote on whether the president is incapable of serving. A two-thirds majority in both houses is required to make that determination. As soon as there is a vote with a two-thirds majority, the president loses his powers and is removed, and the vice president stops acting and is sworn in as president. But if 21 days of debate and votes ends without a two-thirds majority, the president gets back his powers. What could happen to trigger the 25th Amendment? Vice President Mike Pence and eight of the 15 'principal' Cabinet members would have to agree to notify Congress that President Donald Trump was incapable of running the country. That group is made up of the Secretary of State, Treasury Secretary, Secretary of Defense, Attorney General, Interior Secretary, Agriculture Secretary, Commerce Secretary, Labor Secretary, Health and Human Services Secretary, Transportation Secretary, Energy Secretary , Education Secretary, Veterans Affairs Secretary and Homeland Security Secretary. Their formal notification would go to the House Speaker and, in the senate, to the 'president pro tempore', the Senate's most senior member. As soon as the letter is sent, Pence would become 'acting president.' Alternatively, Congress could set up its own mechanism to decide if he is fit for office - maybe a commission, or a joint committee. Pence would still have to agree with its conclusion and then write formally to the Speaker and president pro tempore. Or another possibility is that the pool of 'principal officers' is considered to be bigger than the 15 and a majority of that group call Trump incapable. What if Trump does not agree? If Trump claims he is capable of holding office, he would write to the House Speaker and the president pro tempore of the Senate within four days, setting up three weeks of intense debate in both houses of Congress. Trump would be removed from office if both two-thirds majorities in both the House and Senate agreed with Pence and his cabal. If either of both chambers fell short of that mark, Trump would retain his powers and likely embark on a wholesale housecleaning, firing Pence and replacing disloyal Cabinet members. Are there any loopholes? The 25th Amendment allows Congress to appoint its own panel to evaluate the president instead of relying on the Cabinet – the men and women who work most closely with Trump – to decide on a course of action. It specifies that some 'other body as Congress may by law provide' could play that role, but Pence would still need to agree with any finding that the president is incapable of discharging his duties. That commission could hypothetically include anyone from presidential historians to psychiatrists, entrusted to assess the president's fitness for office. Another loophole is that it does not spell out that the Cabinet is needed to agree, but says that the 'principal officers' of the departments are needed. That term is undefined in the constitution. In some departments legislation appears to name not just the secretary but deputies and even undersecretaries as 'principal officers', so many more people could be called in to the assessment of Trump's fitness. But Trump's cabinet has a swathe of 'acting' cabinet officer - and it is unclear if they could therefore take part in removing him. Could Trump fire Pence if he rebelled? No. The vice president can resign or be impeached and removed - but he does not serve at the pleasure of the president. Is there any precedent for this? No. Only Section III, the voluntary surrender of presidential powers, has ever been used - and only very briefly. In December 1978, President Jimmy Carter thought about invoking Section III when he was contemplating a surgical procedure to remove hemorrhoids. Presidents Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush both voluntarily relinquished their powers while undergoing procedures under anesthetic. Section IV has also never been invoked, although there have been claims that Ronald Reagan's chief of staff Donald Regan told his successor, Howard Baker, in 1987 that he should be prepared to invoke it because Reagan was inattentive and inept. The PBS documentary 'American Experience' recounts how Baker and his team watched Reagan closely for signs of incapacity during their first meeting and decided he was in perfect command of himself.

McCarthy told Trump that he believes the president should call Biden and continue the tradition of meeting with him for a handover, prior to the inauguration.

He also said Trump should follow tradition and leave a welcome letter in the Resolute Desk for his successor.

Trump said he had not yet decided whether to do so.

Democrats are now poised to impeach Trump this week for 'inciting an insurrection.'

Some Republicans are expected to join Democrats in the vote to impeach Trump, but the U.S. Senate is unlikely to convene in time to consider the article before Trump leaves office at noon on Jan. 20.

In a memo to Republicans ahead of the call Monday, McCarthy told fellow lawmakers he does not back impeachment and suggested other measures, including censure of the president.

Republicans have been left deeply shaken and divided by Wednesday's events.

Some, such as Senators Lisa Murkowski and Pat Toomey, have said they want the president to resign.

Others are furious that it took Trump nearly 24 hours to release a video condemning the violence and lawlessness that overtook Capitol Hill, and saw the Senate chamber broken into by the mob.

They were further incensed by a report in The Washington Post, published on Monday, which claimed that Trump was slow to respond to their appeals for help because he was too gripped by live television coverage of the carnage.

The paper reported that McCarthy contacted Jared Kushner, Trump's son-in-law and senior adviser, while Senator Lindsey Graham phoned Ivanka Trump, the president's daughter, to beg for help.

Kellyanne Conway, a longtime Trump confidante and former White House senior adviser, called an aide who she knew was standing at the president's side.

Chris Christie, a close ally of the president's and a former governor of New Jersey, said he'd spent the last 25 minutes trying to reach Trump directly.

'The president caused this protest to occur; he's the only one who can make it stop,' Christie said.

'The president has to come out and tell his supporters to leave the Capitol grounds and to allow the Congress to do their business peacefully. And anything short of that is an abdication of his responsibility.'

The president still failed to react.

'He was hard to reach, and you know why? Because it was live TV,' said one close Trump adviser.

'If it's TiVo, he just hits pause and takes the calls. If it's live TV, he watches it, and he was just watching it all unfold.'

Trump watched with interest, pleased to see that his supporters were fighting so hard on his behalf, one close adviser told the paper.

Graham, one of Trump's strongest supporters, admitted that the president was slow to realize the magnitude of the problem.

'It took him awhile to appreciate the gravity of the situation,' Graham told the paper.

'The president saw these people as allies in his journey and sympathetic to the idea that the election was stolen.'

'Largest armed protest in American history' is one of three plots to attack the Capitol before Joe Biden's inauguration, cops reveal

Police revealed three plots to attack the Capitol ahead of Joe Biden's inauguration - including the 'largest armed protest in American history.'

It comes as the FBI alerted its staff to possible uprisings at capitols in all 50 states ahead of Inauguration Day, particularly if Trump is removed from office before Biden enters the White House.

Trump's declaration allows the Department of Homeland Security and Federal Emergency Management Agency to coordinate with local authorities as Democrats had been furiously demanding.

On Monday night, the new chiefs of Capitol Police told House Democrats they were looking into three separate plans, including one described as 'the largest armed protest ever to take place on American soil.'

But the most concerning is said to involve armed rioters encircling the Capitol and blocking Democrats from entering - killing them if necessary - so that Republicans can take command of government.

Another protest is being planned in honor of Ashli Babbitt, the USAF veteran who was shot at point blank range by a police officer as she tried to clamber into the Speaker's Lobby during the Trump mob's siege.

'It was pretty overwhelming,' one Democrat told Huffington Post of the police briefing.

Meanwhile the FBI's internal memo warned of a group which was calling for the 'storming' of state, local and federal government buildings, as well as court houses if Trump is removed from office.

The bulletin came to light just as Speaker Nancy Pelosi introduced an article of impeachment accusing Trump of incitement to insurrection, five days after the mob of the president's supporters stormed the Capitol, leaving five people dead in a futile bid to overturn the general election.

More than 6,000 members of the National Guard were deployed to Washington, DC, over the weekend, with dozens of them standing guard over the Capitol during Monday's proceedings.

Capitol Police told Congress that it was preparing for up to tens of thousands of Trump supporters arriving in the days ahead, including possible violence to take control of the White House and the Supreme Court.

Working alongside their colleagues in the National Guard, the police are said to have told Democrats that they had agreed on rules of engagement in the eventuality of an armed demonstration.

They do not plan to shoot anyone unless fired at first, but they added that there were exceptions to the rule.

The police urged caution on lawmakers about leaking any specifics to the press because Big Tech had so successfully 'cut off main communications' that many could now only learn of plans through traditional media.

One member remarked that the Silicon Valley gagging order on Trump's supporters 'might ultimately save lives.'

But as the Capitol Police expressed confidence it was making sufficient plans to combat any violent uprisings, some lawmakers questioned whether this was the case given the lax security last week.

One Democrat told the police chiefs that there was clear evidence that some in the police department could be 'in league with the insurrectionists who love to carry their guns.'

'You can't just let them bypass security and walk right up to Biden and Harris at inauguration,' this lawmaker told HuffPost.

A further area of Democrat speculation surrounded whether the Trump administration was preventing federal law enforcement from lending its expertise to the police.

The member told the HuffPost: 'I don't think anyone has confidence that the folks at the Pentagon, that may or may not even be needed for some of this, or the Department of Homeland Security, where we don't even know who's in charge, are going to be cooperative.'

The Pentagon is now considering sending as many as 13,000 guardsmen to secure the nation's capital on Inauguration Day, January 20. Prior to the Capitol breach, officials had planned to deploy roughly 7,000 guardsmen

The National Park Service said Monday it would close the Washington Monument and other area facilities beginning today and lasting through January 24.

Meanwhile, the Pentagon is reportedly considering sending as many as 13,000 guardsmen to secure the area on Inauguration Day. Prior to last week's breach, officials had planned to deploy roughly 7,000 guardsmen.

The hardened-up security plans come after the Department of Defense said it was aware of 'further possible threats posed by would-be terrorists in the days up to and including Inauguration Day', Congressman Jason Crow (D - Colorado) said in a statement Sunday after speaking with Secretary of the Army Ryan McCarthy about security preparations.

The Department of Homeland Security is working with the Defense Department, local DC authorities and inauguration officials to sharpen the law enforcement response in the coming days, including by erecting non-scalable fencing and security checkpoints around Capitol Hill.

'Now that it happened people will take it much more seriously,' a senior DHS official told CNN in reference to last week's violence. 'Now, the planners, they are all going to take it much more seriously.'

Federal and local authorities have faced fierce criticism for their perceived failure to crack down on Wednesday's insurrection despite evidence that they knew it was coming.

Hundreds of people might now face federal charges in the wake of last week's Capitol breach, DC's acting US attorney said in an interview with NPR over the weekend, saying a massive, 24-hour-a-day hunt was on to identify suspects and bring charges against them.

In the meantime, DC Mayor Muriel Bowser said she is 'extremely concerned' about security on Inauguration Day in a letter to acting DHS Secretary Chad Wolf over the weekend. She wrote that the event 'will require a very different approach to previous inaugurations given the chaos, injury and death experienced at the US Capitol during the insurrection'.

On Monday the National Park Service announced that the National Mall and Memorial Parks will be shuttered until January 24 'in response to credible threats' after last week's riots.

Monday's FBI bulletin said the bureau is aware of plans for armed protests in every single state between January 16 and 20 - with one major demonstration slated to take place in Washington, DC, on January 17.

It said an 'identified armed group', which was not named directly, intends to travel to the nation's capital ahead of the protest on January 16. 'They have warned that if Congress attempts to remove POTUS via the 25th Amendment a huge uprising will occur,' the bulletin stated, according to ABC News correspondent Aaron Katersky.

Twitter cited online chatter about a 'proposed secondary attack' on the US Capitol and its counterparts in all 50 states when it moved to suspend Trump's account on Friday.

'Plans for future armed protests have already begun proliferating on and off-Twitter, including a proposed secondary attack on the US Capitol and state capitol buildings on January 17, 2021,' the company wrote in a blog post, without offering further detail.

Twitter was believed to be referring to the same chatter cited in the FBI bulletin.

Biden and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris are set to be sworn in on the west front of the US Capitol on January 20 before participating in a Pass in Review on the east front and then receiving a traditional escort to the White House by representatives from every branch of the military.

Biden's team has remained adamant that the inaugural events, which were paired down prior to the MAGA riots to avoid drawing large crowds rife for transmission of coronavirus, should go forward despite last Wednesday's events.

'We are confident in our security partners who have spent months planning and preparing for the inauguration, and we are continuing to work with them to ensure the utmost safety and security of the president-elect,' a senior Biden inauguration official said last week.

https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jun/24/us-cities-protest-roe-v-wade-abortion-rights;‘It’s important to fight’: US cities erupt in protest as Roe v Wade falls;"Massive protests swept across the US in response to the supreme court decision overturning the constitutional right to abortion.

Soon after the decision was released on Friday, reversing federal reproductive protections that have been in place for half a century, pro-choice demonstrators began gathering in major cities and smaller towns in a wide range of communities and regions.

In addition to the large demonstration outside the supreme court in Washington DC – where activists shouted, “This decision must not stand! Legal abortion on demand!” and “We won’t go back!” – protesters rallied in New York City, Los Angeles, Chicago, Austin, Houston, Nashville, Kansas City, Topeka, Tallahassee, Miami, Oklahoma, Boise, New Orleans and Detroit. Solidarity protests also erupted overseas in London and Berlin.

In Arizona, people protesting the decision in Phoenix were sent fleeing when police fired tear gas from the state capitol building after demonstrators banged on the doors of the senate, according to eyewitness reports.

“I’m in a state of mourning and also very angry, and I want to turn that feeling into something where I can contribute to the solution,” said Mary McNamara, a San Francisco attorney who was heading out to protest in the northern California city. “We have to go to the streets and raise our voices, even in blue states where our rights are protected. This is one of the most consequential decisions of the past 50 years … and we’re entering into a very dark era.”

McNamara is president of the Bar Association of San Francisco, which is organizing to provide free legal services to people affected by the end of Roe v Wade protections. She added: “I have no faith that the supreme court is going to stop here. I think this is the start of a massive retrenchment on individual rights.”

In Washington Square park in New York, Lucy Schneider, 101, arrived with her granddaughter and carried a sign that said, Centenarian for Choice. “I’m very much opposed to the current supreme court and everything they’re doing. It’s just awful,” she said, adding, “I want her to be free to have an abortion if necessary. I hope it won’t come to that, but I want her to be able to.”

Her granddaughter, Emily Savin, 36, said she has been advocating for choice since high school.

“It was important to me to fight for this. I don’t think I could fully grasp that it could really be taken away … I’m heartbroken and angry.”

Nearby, Kelsey Clough, 29, said, “It wasn’t an option not to be here. It kind of feels like my whole life’s falling apart when I see little kids get shot in a classroom and all I see is politicians trying to control what I do. I feel pretty helpless, but if me being here, holding my sign, is going to help people, I want to be.”

By the evening, protesters had taken over Park Avenue in Manhattan, shouting, “Whose streets? Our streets!” before marching toward Times Square where demonstrators shouted chants against Fox News outside its offices.

In Washington DC, outside the supreme court, where officers in riot gear were deployed, protester Sara Kugler said, “This has been a fight 30 years in the making to overturn women and people’s fundamental rights to make decisions about their body. There is no coming back from this. There is no response other than outrage and action.”

Anti-abortion activists also gathered outside the court celebrating the decision soon after it was announced, while critics chanted that the court was “illegitimate”. Elsewhere in the nation’s capital city, a pro-choice demonstrator shut down a bridge after climbing its arch, and called on others to engage in nonviolent civil resistance.

In Missouri, one of the states with a “trigger law” to automatically ban abortion after the Roe decision, an abortion clinic escort in the city of Jackson told a reporter, “We are looking at suffering and death. How should we feel? We see what’s coming. Those with means, they will get what they need. Those without it, they will suffer. America is not ready for what’s about to happen.”

Cori Bush, the Missouri congresswoman who has spoken out about her own abortion as a teenager, tweeted: “Abortion care IS healthcare. It was so before this. And it will remain so after this. We don’t care what a far-right extremist supreme court that is in a crisis of legitimacy says. Your racist, sexist, classist ruling won’t stop us from accessing the care we need.”

Indra Lusero, the director of Elephant Circle, a birth justice organization, who was heading to a protest in Grand Junction, Colorado, said the decision was not surprising, but still painful to absorb: “It hits some of us directly in our bodies. I felt it physiologically. This implicates our physical autonomy so fundamentally.”

Lusero said they were thinking of the disparate harms of the decision as more pregnant people are unable to get abortions: “When people are coerced into carrying a pregnancy to term, that comes with risks, and those risks aren’t equally borne because of inequities built into our system. Black and Indigenous folks in particular are more likely to experience mortality.”

In Boise, Idaho, a demonstrator held a sign that read, “I shouldn’t have to fight a fight my mom already won.” In Charlotte, North Carolina, activists shouted, “My body, my choice!” And in downtown Los Angeles, marchers took over the streets, chanting, “We are not your incubators. Fuck the court and the legislature!”

In some liberal cities, progressive activists said they wanted to see a more aggressive response from Democratic elected officials. In San Francisco, Jackie Fielder, a former candidate for state senate, said she was frustrated to see Democrats like the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, fundraising off of the decision given her recent support of an anti-abortion Democrat, and the lack of action to expand the supreme court or abolish the filibuster: “It’s hard to believe that Democratic leadership are going to do anything.”

Fielder was heading to the annual Trans March in the city’s Dolores Park where marchers shouted, “When our community is under attack, what do we do? Rise up, fight back!” and held signs saying, “Abortion rights are trans rights.”

She added, “We’re very privileged in California to have access to abortion and other reproductive justice means, but we really gotta dig deep to figure out how to support people in other states. This is a matter of life and death.”

https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/sep/19/rioters-after-southport-attack-largely-racially-motivated-thugs-met-chief-says;Rioters after Southport attack ‘largely racially motivated thugs’, Met chief says;"The people behind the violence in England this summer were “largely racially motivated criminal thugs”, the Metropolitan police commissioner has said, as he revealed that some of those arrested in London had previous convictions for violent offences.

Sir Mark Rowley said data about those arrested after a supposed protest in Whitehall, in central London, in late July supported his view.

Serious disorder broke out triggered by false information about the alleged identity of man who killed three children at a dance class in Southport, Merseyside. The next night there was a riot in the town, followed by further violent gatherings across England that triggered a huge police mobilisation.

Rowley was speaking at the London policing board, and the data about the previous criminal history of those accused of involvement in the London disorder was contained in police documents submitted to the board.

The Met said that at the so-called protest just outside Downing Street on 31 July, 92 individuals were arrested over a total of 108 alleged offences.

One-third of those alleged offences involved violence, and 62% of those arrested in those cases “had a previous arrest or conviction for violent offending, including murder”, the Met document said.

It said 39% were known for drug offences, “8% have a history of racially aggravated offending, and 2% have a history of homophobia. Four individuals (6%) are known for child sexual abuse and exploitation, three of which included rape or sexual assault of a child, and one for possession of indecent images of children.”

It added: “Forty per cent of those with a criminal history of violent offences are known for offences against women and girls.”

The Met document said 20% had no recorded history of criminality.

Rowley said it was “a very violent protest” and it had been a “brutal and difficult time for policing”.

Online, hate had spewed towards minorities but also towards officers, the commissioner said, and he hit out at a widely derided far-right claim of two-tier policing. “It was also toxic towards police officers and increased the violence that they faced. Part of that was suggesting that these were somehow legitimate protests and were being unfairly policed.”

Rowley said: “The vast majority of them are criminals with a violent history. Violence against women and girls, football violence … They don’t look an average bunch of citizens to me, they’re basically largely a bunch of racially motivated criminal thugs.”

He said he had been nervous about the counter-protests, largely organised by anti-racism groups, but in the end they helped policing.

Rowley also said he feared that the annual Notting Hill carnival could become the scene of a Hillsborough-style crush causing scores of deaths, and said the event was “poorly run”.

In the Hillsborough football disaster in 1989, 97 people died, mostly after being crushed after a surge of fans in the Sheffield stadium.

Rowley said he supported the carnival taking placed but a mass crush was his biggest fear. “So we try and put in mitigations to try and reduce the risk of a Hillsborough-type event, but we are mitigating something that is unsatisfactory. You can’t mitigate all that risk out.”";True;1;0.9461583495140076;high_pos;1

At least 200 protestors gathered in Lakemba, Sydney's Muslim heartland, on Tuesday night for an unauthorised anti-Israel rally at the reserve on The Boulevarde.

The ugly scenes on the streets of the city's south-west saw Prime Minister Scott Morrison caution Australians not to bring the war over here.

'Of course we are all very concerned about what is happening there,' he told Ben Fordham on 2GB.

'We have been urging restraint from all parties involved there to not take any unilateral action on those very stressful and tense situations we are finding there.

'But those things should not be played out here in Australia.'

In heated scenes in Lakemba, police seized the alleged burning flag from the beanie-clad woman, 48, and extinguished it at 9.30pm.

The anti-Israel protester had allegedly been running through the traffic holding the burning flag.

She allegedly fled the scene but was arrested a short time later and charged with behaving in an offensive manner in public and deliberating obstructing police and other members of the public.

The woman is due to appear at Bankstown Local Court on July 8.

Mr Morrison also restated the government's policy of a two-state solution between Israel and Palestine and described Australia as 'an agent for peace'.

He urged Australians with ties to the conflict to act with tolerance and respect.

The protest comes as tensions flare in the Middle East, sparking the worst violence in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict since 2019.

Pictured: Smoke and flames rise after Israeli fighter jets conducted airstrikes over Beit Lahia in the Gaza Strip, on May 13, 2021 as Israel pressed ahead with a fierce military offensive in the Gaza Strip, killing as many as 11 senior Hamas military figures

Six high-ranking commanders and a further five key Hamas figures were 'neutralised' on Wednesday, including Brigadier General Bassem Issa and Jamal Zabda, head of the group's rocket unit, according to the Israeli Defence Force (IDF)

Israel on Thursday pressed ahead with a fierce military offensive in the Gaza Strip, killing as many as 11 senior Hamas military figures and toppling a pair of high-rise towers housing Hamas facilities in a series of airstrikes.

But the Islamic militant group showed no signs of backing down and fired hundreds of rockets at Israeli cities.

Palestinian militants have stockpiled enough missiles to continue bombing Israel for the next two months, security experts have warned, as escalating fighting led the UN to warn of 'all-out war'.

Meanwhile, street clashes continued across Israel, with Jewish and Arab citizens both attacking one-another in numerous incidents, leading to over 370 arrests across the country.

In one incident, an Arab man was dragged from his car and beaten by Jewish ultranationalists, while in another a Jewish citizen was attacked by sticks and stones by Arab Israeli protesters.

At least 67 people have been killed in Gaza since violence escalated on Monday, according to the enclave's health ministry. Seven people have been killed in Israel, medical officials said.

Israel's defence minister Benny Gantz vowed more attacks on Gaza to bring 'total, long-term quiet' before they would consider truce talks after six days of violence. Prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu said his military would only use 'increasing force' in the conflict.

'We eliminated senior Hamas commanders and this is just the beginning,' he said. 'We will inflict blows on them that they couldn't even dream of.' The leader of Hamas Ismail Haniyeh hit back, vowing that 'if Israel wants to escalate, we are ready for it'.

Six high-ranking commanders and a further five key Hamas figures were 'neutralised' on Wednesday, including Brigadier General Bassem Issa and Jamal Zabda, head of the group's rocket unit, according to the Israeli Defence Force (IDF).

The UN's Middle East peace envoy Tor Wennesland warned the latest violence was 'escalating towards a full-scale war'. And UN secretary-general Antonio Guterres said he was 'gravely concerned' by the ongoing troubles.

Hamas and Islamic Jihad fired more than 1,000 missiles in the first 48 hours of the conflict which began on Monday, an average of one every three minutes, and has enough to keep the bombardment going for two months.

Israeli military spokesman Lt Col Jonathan Conricus said: 'According to our estimates we're talking about between 20,000 and 30,000 rockets in Gaza today, rockets and mortars.

'We've seen a constant expansion in terms of range and also in terms of the size of the warheads. They have an advanced arsenal of rockets, I think it's on a par with the fire capabilities of a few small European countries.'

While Israel's Iron Dome aerial defence system has intercepted nine out of ten Palestinian rockets, the remainder have killed at least six civilians and injured more than 90. Families in Tel Aviv spent most of yesterday taking cover in underground shelters.

Israel's retaliation has included hundreds of air strikes on Gaza, led by F-35 stealth bombers and Apache attack helicopters, which are understood to have killed 32 and wounded 300. Israel says most of the dead were terrorists and insists 13 children killed were victims of stray Palestinian rockets.

The UN security council met yesterday to discuss the crisis. The heaviest offensive between Israel and Hamas since a 2014 war in the Hamas-ruled enclave has increased international concern that the situation could spiral out of control.

'Israel has gone crazy,' said a man on a Gaza street, where people ran out of their homes as explosions rocked buildings.

Sirens went off in northern Israel on Thursday, local media said, warning of what may be the longest-range Palestinian rocket launch from the Gaza Strip during this week's surge in cross-border fighting.

There was no immediate word of a rocket strike or casualties in Nahalal, some 100 km (62 miles) from Gaza.

Unrest has been growing in Israel and Gaza in recent weeks following violent confrontations between Israeli police and Palestinian protesters in Jerusalem and a long-running dispute over the eviction of Palestinian families from East Jerusalem in favour of Jewish settlers.

Netanyahu vows to 'inflict blows that Hamas has not dreamed of' before Israeli air strike levels 14-storey building and Hamas retaliates with 130 rockets

Benjamin Netanyahu on Wednesday threatened to 'inflict blows that Hamas has not dreamed of' before Israeli rockets levelled a 14-storey tower bloc, prompting Hamas to retaliate with 130 rockets of its own, as the deadly fighting in the middle east continued on Wednesday.

Israeli fighter jets dropped two bombs on the 14-storey Al-Sharouk tower, which housed the bureau of the Al-Aqsa television channel, and is the third tall structure in Gaza City levelled since the bombing campaign began Monday.

The Israeli Prime Minister issued the threat as he visited a hospital in the city of Holon today, paying tribute to those wounded in fighting between the two sides that is now at its worst point since the 2014 Gaza War.

Referencing the deaths of Hamas commanders earlier in the day - including Brigadier General Bassem Issa and Jamal Zabda, head of the group's rocket unit - Netanyahu vowed: 'This is only the beginning.'

Israel diverts flight from Ben Gurion to southern airport after US airlines suspend flights to country Israel diverted an incoming flight from Ben Gurion Airport on Thursday to a southern airport designed to serve as a wartime alternative to its main international gateway outside Tel Aviv, aviation tracker Avi Scharf said on Twitter. The El Al Israel Airlines flight 332 was en route to land at Ramon Airport near Eilat, said Scharf, an editor with Israel's Haaretz newspaper said. Online data suggested the flight had come from Brussels. It came after United States airlines - American Airlines, United Airlines and Delta Air Lines - suspended flights to Israel through Thursday amid rising violence in the conflict between Israel and Palestinians. Israeli airstrikes hit Gaza, and Palestinian militants in Gaza fired rockets at targets in Israel, including the main airport in Tel Aviv. American Airlines cancelled its daily flight from New York to Tel Aviv on Wednesday and Thursday and offered to put passengers on flights at later dates, according to an airline spokesman. United cancelled flights from Chicago, Newark and San Francisco, and Delta cancelled flights from New York to Tel Aviv. Company representatives said the airlines were monitoring the situation for when they might resume the flights. Advertisement

His comments came despite international calls for urgent deescalation and as Israel braces for more missile strikes overnight to avenge the deaths of its commanders.

In just two days of fighting, Hamas has fired more than 1,000 rockets at Israel, while the Jewish state has carried out counter-strikes against what it called military targets.

But the civilian death toll is quickly mounting, with at least with at least 67 Palestinians including 14 children and three women killed as of Wednesday evening, alongside seven Israelis including one child and one soldier.

Israeli police announced Wednesday that they are imposing a nighttime curfew on the central city of Lod, that was the scene of unrest in recent days

Police said in a statement that officers would enforce the ban on people entering Lod, residents leaving their homes, and people in public spaces starting at 8 p.m.

Lod has seen two nights of violent protests, including the torching of dozens of vehicles, a synagogue, and violent clashes between Arab protesters and police. Israeli authorities declared a state of emergency in the city and deployed Border Police forces.

Hamas has confirmed that Bassem Issa, commander of its Gaza City Brigade, was among those 'martyred' today.

Shin Bet, Israel's internal security agency, named another three slain Hamas officers: Jamaa Tahla, responsible for the improved accuracy of the group's rockets; Jamal Zabeda, chief of 'special projects' in the munitions department; and Hazzem Hatib, head engineer in the munitions wing.

The militants have launched more than 1,050 rockets at Israel since Monday, killing six civilians, including an Arab-Israeli girl in the city of Lod in the early hours of this morning.

'The army will continue to attack to bring a total, long-term quiet. Only when we reach that goal will we be able to speak about a truce,' Defence Minister Benny Gantz said today from the southern town of Ashkelon where two Israeli women were killed by Hamas rockets on Tuesday.

Along the Gaza border, an Israeli soldier was also killed by an anti-tank missile, the military said.

Israeli ultranationalists attack Arab driver in Tel Aviv suburb and Jewish citizen is attacked as clashes on the streets continue on Wednesday, leading to over 370 arrests

As rockets from Gaza streaked overhead, Arabs and Jews fought each other on the streets below and rioters torched vehicles, a restaurant and a synagogue in one of the worst spasms of communal violence Israel has seen in years. The violence lead to over 370 arrest, police said.

The mayor of the mixed town of Lod, which saw the worst of the violence Tuesday, compared it to a civil war or a Palestinian uprising. Arab experts and activists say the violence was fueled by unrest in Jerusalem that has brought Israel to the brink of another Gaza war, but is rooted in deeper grievances that go back to the founding of the state.

Violence flared again Wednesday night with a wave of apparent revenge attacks. In Bat Yam, a Tel Aviv suburb, a large crowd of ultranationalist Israelis pulled a man from a car who they thought was Arab and beat him until he lay on the ground motionless and bloodied. A hospital said he's in serious condition without identifying him.

Earlier, a group of black-clad Israelis smashed the windows of an Arab-owned ice cream shop in Bat Yam and ultranationalists could be seen chanting, 'Death to Arabs!' on live television during a standoff with Border Police. In the northern city of Tiberias, video uploaded to social media appeared to show flag-waving Israelis attacking a car.

Israel's Channel 13 quoted a senior police officer as saying Arabs are suspected of attacking and seriously wounding a Jewish man in the coastal city of Acre amid new clashes there.

In a late night television interview, Israeli President Reuven Rivlin, whose figurehead office is meant to serve as the nation's moral compass, said the country was gripped by civil war and urged citizens to 'stop this madness.'

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called on both Jews and Arabs to cease attacks on each other: 'It doesn't matter to me that your blood is boiling. You can't take the law in your hands,' he said.

Police said they arrested nearly 400 people allegedly 'involved in riots and disturbances' across the country Wednesday.

The violence comes at a time when Israel's Arab minority appeared to be gaining new acceptance and influence. Mansour Abbas, the head of an Arab party with Islamist roots, emerged as a kingmaker of sorts after March elections and was poised to play a key role in a coalition that would oust Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his right-wing allies.

But in an interview with The Associated Press on Wednesday, Abbas indicated that coalition talks would be put on hold because of the escalating violence. 'If there is a cease-fire, we will return to the political track to form a government,' he said.

In recent days, Arab citizens of Israel have held mass protests across the country over Israel's policing of a flashpoint holy site in Jerusalem and plans to evict dozens of Palestinian families in the city following a legal campaign by Jewish settlers.

Adding to the tensions are increasingly powerful far-right groups in Israel that won seats in March elections and are allied with Netanyahu. In recent days, far-right politicians have visited the tense east Jerusalem neighborhood where the families are threatened with eviction and staged marches elsewhere in the bitterly contested city.

After police broke up a protest Monday night in Lod, a young Arab resident was shot and killed. Police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld said the man was with a group of rioters threatening Jewish homes, and that Jewish residents opened fire in a 'life-threatening situation.' He said three people have been detained for questioning and police are investigating. Arab residents of Lod disputed the account, pointing out that the slain man was unarmed.

His funeral the next day drew thousands of people and a heavy police presence. Clashes broke out between the two sides, leading to riots in which several vehicles and a synagogue were set ablaze. A 56-year-old Jewish man was severely wounded after Arabs pelted his car with rocks, according to the Magen David Adom emergency service.

The violence soon spread to other mixed communities across Israel. In neighboring Ramle, ultra-nationalist Jewish demonstrators vandalized Arab cars. In Acre, protesters torched Uri Buri, a famous Jewish-owned seafood restaurant. Magen David Adom said 46 people were wounded in the riots.

Rosenfeld said there were several different instances of Arabs attacking Jews, and that 12 police officers were wounded. He said 270 suspects were arrested at 40 locations across the country where vehicles were set on fire and public property was damaged.

'The Arabs don't want us here, but we're going to stay,' said Avraham Sagron, a Jewish resident of Lod, as he surveyed the charred entrance of the synagogue, the interior of which appeared largely untouched.

Netanyahu visited Lod and Acre, where he pledged to 'stop the anarchy' and restore order 'with an iron fist if needed.' He called on Arab and other community leaders to condemn the violence and act to stop it.

Authorities deployed hundreds of police reinforcements to Lod and other areas, including paramilitary border police who usually operate in the occupied West Bank. They also ordered a nighttime curfew in Lod.

Arabs say the violence of the past two days was not directed at Jews, but at religious nationalists with close ties to the settlement movement who have moved into mixed areas in recent years, pushing Arab residents out.

Israel's Arab minority makes up about 20% of the population and are the descendants of Palestinians who stayed in the country after the 1948 war surrounding Israel's creation, when an estimated 700,000 fled or were driven from their homes in towns like Lod. They have citizenship, including the right to vote, but face widespread discrimination.

Arab citizens speak Hebrew and are well-represented in Israel's medical profession and universities, but they largely identify with the Palestinian cause, leading many Israelis to view them with suspicion. Lod's Arabs, who make up about a third of the city's population, are among the poorest communities in Israel.

'We're talking about young people who have no horizon, no dreams, who are unemployed and live in a very difficult reality,' said Dr. Nasreen Haddad Haj-Yahya, the director of the Arab-Jewish relations program at the Israel Democracy Institute, an independent think tank.

She said the anger of the last two days was not directed at Lod's longtime Jewish community but at more ideological recent arrivals.

'It's not because of who they are. It's because they are trying to Judaize Lod. They are trying to drive out the indigenous Arab residents,' she said. 'The young people see it as a threat to their presence in the land, to their existence.'

Thabet Abu Rass, the co-director of the Abraham Initiatives, which promotes Jewish-Arab coexistence, said the six Arab members of Lod's municipal council have been sidelined and the city's budget heavily favors Jews. He accused Mayor Yair Revivo of inciting against Arabs.

Revivo, a member of Netanyahu's right-wing Likud party, has courted controversy by complaining about the volume of the Muslim call to prayer in Lod and for remarks that appeared to cast its Arab residents as a national security threat.

'He should be a mayor for everybody,' said Abu Rass, who lives near Lod and has an office there. 'He's not giving equal services for all residents.'

The mayor's spokesman said he was not available for comment. Earlier, Revivo had urged Arab residents to end the violence, saying: 'The day after, we will still have to live here together.'

Israeli officials often hold up the Arab minority as proof of their commitment to tolerance, frequently pointing out that Arab citizens enjoy civic rights and freedoms that many Arab states deny their own people.

Ghassan Munayyer, a Lod-based activist, says the veneer of coexistence conceals deeper disparities, including in housing and infrastructure, comparing its Arab neighborhoods to 'refugee camps.'

'The Jews love saying there's coexistence. They go out to eat in an Arab restaurant and they call it coexistence,' he said. 'But they don't see Arabs as equal human beings who have rights that they have to respect.'

Britain, the United States and Russia among international voices calling for de-escalation in Israel-Gaza conflict

Calls for deescalation of the conflict have come from senior politicians around the world, including the United Kingdom, the United States and Russia.

Washington announced that it planned to send an envoy, Hady Amr, for talks with Israel and Palestinians.

'My expectation and hope is this will be closing down sooner than later, but Israel has a right to defend itself,' Biden said on Wednesday after speaking to Netanyahu.

Biden did not explain the reasons behind his optimism. Netanyahu's office said he told the U.S. president that Israel would 'continue acting to strike at the military capabilities of Hamas and the other terrorist groups active in the Gaza Strip'.



Biden's British counterpart Boris Johnson Boris condemned the spiralling conflict, saying he was 'urging Israel and the Palestinians to step back from the brink and for both sides to show restraint' on Wednesday morning.

Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov called for an urgent meeting of the Middle East Quartet in order to halt violence between Israel and the Palestinians.

Ms Psaki said that the Biden administration has 'had more than 25, high level calls and meetings by senior US officials with senior officials from Israel, the Palestinian Authority, and their partners and other stakeholders.

'A lot of it is happening, privately through diplomatic channels, it's happening with officials in the region we're in regular dialogue, multiple times per day as I noted with the Egyptian and Qatari officials, who have significant influence over Hamas - and our objective here is descalation as we look to protecting the people to reach out.'

Meanwhile, U.S. Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken has called Netanyahu to reaffirm America's support for Israel's right to defend itself from Hamas rocket attacks.

The country's State Department said he also repeated U.S. calls for a de-escalation of violence and the Biden administration's belief that both Israelis and Palestinians have the right to live in safety and security.

Blinken announced earlier he was sending a senior diplomat to the region to make similar appeals in person to Israeli and Palestinian officials. He also said that Israel had an 'extra burden' to avoid civilian casualties as it responds to the attacks.

According to the State Department, Blinken also told Netanyahu that as he and President Joe Biden have said in the past, the administration believes Israelis and Palestinians should 'enjoy equal measures of freedom, security, prosperity, and democracy.'

He also 'emphasised the need for Israelis and Palestinians to be able to live in safety and security, as well as enjoy equal measures of freedom, security, prosperity, and democracy,' in an apparent effort for the Biden administration to demonstrate that it cares about Palestinian rights, according to Politico.

Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he wants to see an 'urgent de-escalation of tensions' between Israel and Hamas amid the most severe outbreak of violence since the 2014 Gaza war.

Johnson tweeted on Wednesday that the United Kingdom is 'deeply concerned' and urged leaders to 'step back from the brink.'

He was one of many leaders around the world offering up advice after longtime tensions in contested Jerusalem erupted into rocket-fire from the Gaza Strip and an intense response from Israel.

British Foreign Office Minister James Cleverly told Parliament that Britain 'unequivocally condemns the firing of rockets at Jerusalem and other locations in Israel.' He called Hamas' conduct 'terrorism' and called on militants to 'end their incitement and rocket fire against Israel.'

Cleverly said Israel has a 'legitimate right to self-defense,' but added that in doing so, 'it is vital that all actions are proportionate, in line with international humanitarian law and make every effort to avoid civilian casualties.'

Also on Wednesday, speaking alongside United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, Russia's Lavrov said: 'Today we've come to the common opinion that the most pressing task is to convene the Quartet of international mediators - Russia, the United States, the UN and the EU.'

Hamas militants and their allies have fired more than 1,000 missiles at Israel, though many have been shot down by the Iron Dome defence system, while others have landed inside Gaza. The Israeli towns of Ashdod, Ashkelon and Yehud have been struck, as well as the most populous city, Tel Aviv. In the Gaza Strip, the Israeli Air Force has targeted suspected Hamas strongholds in Gaza City as well as the southern settlements Rafah and Khan Yunis

Terrifying footage shows Hamas rocket blow up a bus, yards from civilians Terrifying video footage has emerged of a rocket launched by Hamas militants blowing up a bus in Israel as civilians watched on in horror. Video shows the city bus erupting in flames, with black smoke billowing from the burning vehicle, in the central city of Holon, just south of Tel Aviv, last night. In other videos, dozens of Israel's Iron Dome defence system's missiles can be seen lighting up the night sky yesterday as they shot down a bombardment of rockets fired by Hamas militants. Residents of Tel Aviv, Israel's most populous city, hid in their houses and under shelters as scores of rockets were seen flying overhead before they were struck down by Israeli missiles.

Just after daybreak, the Israeli Air Force unleashed dozens of strikes within the course of a few minutes with what appeared to be bunker buster bombs targeting underground Hamas infrastructure.

The Israeli Defence Forces later dispatched two infantry brigades to the area of a downed militant drone, indicating preparations for a possible ground invasion.

Boris Johnson condemned the spiralling conflict this morning hours after his former counterpart Donald Trump blamed 'weak' Joe Biden for allowing things to escalate.

'I am urging Israel and the Palestinians to step back from the brink and for both sides to show restraint,' the Prime Minister said. 'The UK is deeply concerned by the growing violence and civilian casualties.'

Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab spoke to the Israeli foreign minister on Tuesday and will speak to the Palestinian prime minister on Wednesday, MPs were told in Westminster.

Despite international condemnation for the bloodshed, the worst since the 2014 war, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has rejected calls for ceasefire, vowing last night to 'step up' attacks.

Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh said in turn that 'if Israel wants to escalate, we are ready for it'.

The tensions began a month ago in Jerusalem, where heavy-handed police tactics during Ramadan and the threatened eviction of dozens of Muslim neighbourhoods ignited protests and clashes with police. On Monday, a riot on Temple Mount left hundreds of Palestinians wounded before Hamas started launching rockets.

The International Criminal Court at the Hague announced this morning it was looking at possible 'crimes' committed as the ferocious cross-border engagement entered its third day.

'I note with great concern the escalation of violence in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, as well as in and around Gaza, and the possible commission of crimes under the Rome Statute (which founded the ICC)', Fatou Bensouda tweeted.

More than a hundred Hamas rockets were launched at Israel's most populous city, Tel Aviv, last night after a tower block in Gaza suspected of being a Hamas headquarters was destroyed by an Israeli air strike.

Palestinians assess the damage caused by an Israeli air strike in the town of Khan Yunis, in the southern Gaza Strip, on May 12, 2021. Heavy exchanges of rocket fire and air strikes, and rioting in mixed Jewish-Arab towns, fuelled fears today that deadly violence between Israel and Palestinians could spiral into 'full-scale war'

Smoke billows from an Israeli air strike on a tower block in Gaza as it collapses. The destruction of apartment apartment towers was among several tactics used during the 2014 war that are now the subject of an investigation by the International Criminal Court into possible war crimes. Israel is not a member of the court and has rejected the probe.

Israelis sing to keep their spirits up in a Tel Aviv bomb shelter Footage has emerged of Israelis singing in a bomb shelter as fighting between the Jewish state and Hamas intensified today amid warnings of all-out war. The video was taken in Tel Aviv overnight as the city was targeted by a barrage of rockets fired from Gaza. It shows a large group of people standing in what appears to be a basement car park being led in song by Shuli Rand, a well-known Jewish actor and musician. The song is called Between Holiness and Secularity, and the lyrics that appear in the video translate as: 'Please save me and please keep me from harm.' Footage has emerged of Israelis in a bomb shelter in Tel Aviv overnight singing as the city was targeted by 201 Hamas rockets Tel Aviv found itself targeted overnight by rockets as Hamas said 210 rockets had been fired at the city, which is Israel's most-populous. The strike was in retaliation for a multi-storey block of apartments that was blown up in Gaza, Hamas said. At least 67 people have been killed in Gaza since violence escalated on Monday, according to the enclave's health ministry. Six people have been killed in Israel, medical officials said.

The IDF have assassinated several top militant commanders, including Hassan Kaogi, head of the Hamas intelligence department, in their airstrikes.

In a statement, the army said it carried out a 'complex and first-of-its-kind operation.' Those targeted, it said, were 'a key part of the Hamas 'General Staff'' and considered close to the head of the group's military wing.

Hamas later confirmed they had lost several of their top brass, including its military chief in Gaza City, Bassem Issa.

The Israelis accuse the Palestinian fighters of using their own people as human shields, but the civilian casualties in the Gaza Strip have only hardened the position of the extremists who have launched hundreds more missiles.

In Israel's central city of Lod, a girl and her father were killed in the early hours of Wednesday by rocket fire from Gaza. Israel's foreign ministry identified the girl as 16-year-old Nadin Awad, an Arab Israeli.

Her cousin, Ahmad Ismail, told public broadcaster Kan that he was near Nadin when she was killed alongside her father Khalil Awad, 52.

'I was at home, we heard the noise of the rocket. It happened so quickly. Even if we had wanted to run somewhere, we don't have a safe room,' Ismail told Kan.

Lod also saw riots after thousands of mourners joined a funeral for an Arab man killed by a suspected Jewish gunman the previous night.

The crowd fought with police, and set a synagogue and some 30 vehicles, including a police car, on fire, Israeli media reported.

Paramedics said a 56-year-old man was seriously hurt after his car was pelted with stones.

The Israeli President Reuven Rivlin described it as a 'pogrom' carried out by a 'bloodthirsty Arab mob,' after Netanyahu declared a state of emergency in the mixed Jewish-Arab city.

'The sight of the pogrom in Lod and the disturbances across the country by an incited and bloodthirsty Arab mob, injuring people, damaging property and even attacking sacred Jewish spaces is unforgivable,' Rivlin said.

Yair Revivo, mayor of the city, last night called for army back-up to help secure the area, saying 'civil war' was breaking out.

'This is Kristallnacht in Lod,' said Revivo, in reference to the Nazi pogrom against German Jews in 1938.

'I have called on the prime minister to declare a state of emergency in Lod. To call in the IDF. To impose a curfew. To restore quiet. There is a failure of governance.

'This is a giant incident - an Intifada of Arab Israelis. All the work we have done here for years [on coexistence] has gone down the drain.'

Netanhayu made a pre-dawn tour of the city to declare a state of emergency.

'We will not tolerate this; we need to restore calm,' Netanyahu said in Lod. 'If this isn't an emergency situation, I don't know what is. We are talking about life and death here.'

TRUMP: 'WEAK' BIDEN TO BLAME FOR CONFLICT Former US President Donald Trump blamed his successor Joe Biden's 'weakness' for the renewed clashes in the Middle East. Writing on his website Trump, he said: 'When I was in office we were known as the Peace Presidency, because Israel's adversaries knew that the United States stood strongly with Israel and there would be swift retribution if Israel was attacked. 'Under Biden, the world is getting more violent and more unstable because Biden's weakness and lack of support for Israel is leading to new attacks on our allies. 'America must always stand with Israel and make clear that the Palestinians must end the violence, terror, and rocket attacks, and make clear that the U.S. will always strongly support Israel's right to defend itself. 'Unbelievably, Democrats also continue to stand by crazed anti-American Rep. Ilhan Omar, and others, who savagely attack Israel while they are under terrorist assault.' Advertisement

Asked whether the actions of the police against protesters may have played a role, he shut down the suggestion, saying: 'These events have no excuse; this is fundamental hate.'

It comes after the PM, speaking after two women were killed in Hamas strikes yesterday, said he 'deplored' the deaths in Israel, adding that the country's military would 'further increase both the intensity and the rate' of its own air strikes against Gaza.

'Hamas will be hit in ways that it does not expect,' Netanyahu said. 'We have eliminated commanders, hit many important targets and we have decided to attack harder and increase the pace of attacks.'

The homes of three Hamas commanders were destroyed overnight on Wednesday.

A significant barrage had begun by 3am, with Israel firing into the Gaza Strip.

'In response to HUNDREDS of rockets in the last 24 hours, the IDF has struck a number of significant terror targets and terror operatives across the Gaza Strip, marking our largest strike since 2014,' the IDF confirmed.

'We are currently striking more terror targets in Gaza.'

In Israel, five people including three women have been killed.

One of the three women was in her 60s and another in her 80s, and died during Hamas rocket attacks earlier on Tuesday.

Jackson Reffitt, 18, told Fox4: 'I got in contact with the FBI after the Capitol riots about my dad. It was my moral compass, kind of, to do what I thought would protect not only my family, but my dad himself.'

His father, Guy Reffitt, 48, was arrested Friday at his home in Wylie, Texas, according to court records.

He is charged with obstruction of justice and unlawful entry. According to an affidavit, the 48-year-old was recorded on video outside the Capitol during the January 6 riot and later threatened his wife and children if they turned him in.

According to local news, Reffitt's wife told officials that he was arguing about the incident with his son and daughter when he told them: 'If you turn me in, you're a traitor and you know what happens to traitors. ... Traitors get shot.'

Reffitt Jr. said Saturday he had not spoken with his dad since his arrest but 'wished he could'. He told The New York Times he was no longer staying at the family home; he would not reveal his location for fear of his safety.

He added: 'I would say I'm sorry, because I don't feel like I put him in this situation, but I still feel guilty. I would do it again.'

Guy Reffitt (pictured at the Capitol), 48, of Texas, who was arrested in connection to the riot at the Capitol earlier this month, allegedly threatened to shoot his children if they became 'traitors' and turned him in to the FBI

The teen is said to have contacted the authorities about his dad in the days before the siege, The New York Times reports.

He told the paper: 'He would always tell me that he's going to do something big. I didn't know what he was going to do, so I just did anything possible just to be on the safe side.'

The FBI then spoke with Reffitt Jr. to follow up on his tip in the wake of the Capitol riots.

Reffitt Jr. said Saturday he had not spoken with his dad since his arrest but 'wished he could'. He told The New York Times he was no longer staying at the family home; he would not reveal his location for fear of his safety. He is pictured speaking with Chris Cuomo on CNN

Jackson said he is 'afraid' about what his dad 'might think' after he finds out he spoke with the FBI and said his mom and two sisters did not know about this contact with the authorities until they saw him being interviewed in the media.

Referring to Donald Trump he told CNN: 'Obviously the man in charge at the time, I feel like, just really manipulated him into thinking what he is thinking now.'

'I'm obviously not sure about that, but I can't know for sure. That's the only thing I can blame this — the politics he follows and idolizes.'

According to an affidavit obtained by Dallas News Reffitt Sr. told his family that he went to Washington, DC, to 'to protect the country,' that he brought a gun with him, and that he 'stormed the Capitol'.

When he returned home, he allegedly told his son not to report him to investigators or he would 'do what he had to do'.

In addition, Reffitt reportedly told his daughter that if she betrayed him and the family that he would 'put a bullet through' her phone.

Reffitt's wife told officials that Reffit (pictured in blue with a helmet at the Capitol) was arguing about the incident with his son and daughter when he told them: 'If you turn me in, you're a traitor and you know what happens to traitors. ... Traitors get shot'

While his wife said she didn't believe that Reffitt (pictured at the Capitol) act on his words, she said that their family felt 'disturbed' by his comments

While his wife said she didn't believe that Reffitt would act on his words, she said that their family felt 'disturbed' by his comments.

Images from that day show Reffitt wearing a helmet with a camera fastened to the front of it. He's also seen in the images wearing a blue jacket and what appears to be a bulletproof vest.

FBI agents found an AR-15 rifle and a pistol during their search of Reffitt's home, according to the affidavit. The court document states that Reffitt´s wife told agents he is a member of the anti-government Three Percenters movement.

Reffitt told agents he was at the Capitol but did not go inside, according to the affidavit.

The man wearing a tracksuit top and shorts was pushed to the ground and handcuffed by cops at St Michaels church in Belfield, where NSW Upper House MP Mark Latham was speaking, as other protesters pushed the police officers.

Shouts of 'f****** gays' can be heard in a clip of the protest.

Two police officers attempted to hold down the protester, while others from the Christian group charged at the line of cops who were separating them from the LGBTQ rights protesters.

As many as 500 Christian protesters violently clashed with an LGBTQ activist group outside the church on Tuesday evening, with at least two people taken away in handcuffs.

Inside the church Mr Latham, the New South Wales One Nation leader, spoke about religious and parental rights ahead of Saturday's state election.

A group of about 15 members from LGBTQ+ activist group Community Action for Rainbow Rights had arrived at the church to protest against the speech, claiming it was 'anti-trans'.

But instead, they were met by a mob of Christian Lives Matter followers, who they claim threw rocks and bottles at them.

The terrifying clash was captured on film and showed the Christian group shouting abuse at the activists.

At one stage, a man is seen throwing a punch into the crowd, only for it to connect with the back of a woman's head.

She is then heard screaming and crying as a friend wraps his arm around her.

Mr Latham addressed the event on Tuesday night and said police had advised him not to speak.

'To not give my speech, to go straight home would have allowed the transgender protesters to cancel my free speech and democratic rights as an election candidate, things that are sacred to me and have been for 35 years in running for elections, local, Federal and State,' he tweeted.

'I didn't see what happened on the front street, but I sincerely convey my best wishes to those injured and thank the police officers involved for their work.

'No one should take the law into their own hands. Violence at political events is wrong.'

Mr Latham stressed he didn't organise the event but was invited to speak.

Speaking to 2GB on Wednesday morning, Mr Latham said politicians should be allowed to speak without groups blocking roads and access to the church.

'There was no need for what happened out the front, it diminishes our democracy, and we're better off sorting out our differences at the ballot box,' he said.

'This is a really bad development in our system, who would go into politics when this is what you face now?

'Transgender activists threatening to block the road and access to the church - that was wrong.

'But keep your hands to yourself, don't be violent.'

During the chaos, a cameraman was shoved to the ground by a Christian protestor as he tried to make his way through the crowd.

'Get the f*** out of here', a large man screams before lashing out.

Another man then pushes him again before being slammed to the ground as a swarm of men stood over him in a circle.

Community Action for Rainbow Rights claimed the religious mob viciously attacked their members.

'Hundreds of violent far-right thugs attacked a small peaceful speak out of LGBTI+ activists with glass bottles, rocks and their fists,' the group wrote on Facebook.

'Several people were punched in the face multiple times and hit with rocks and bottles as they were surrounded by a mob 30 times their size.

'This is a disgusting and violent escalation by the anti-LGBTI+ far-right protesters.'

The group shared a video they claimed was filmed by one of the Christian Lives Matter members who encouraged those going to the protest to grab the activists 'and drag them by their f***ing hair'.

'Go there tomorrow, and f***ing shake them up, drag them by their head and remove them from St Michael's Belfield.'

The NSW Police riot squad eventually had to be called in, with a 34-year-old man arrested and charged with encouraging the commission of crimes.

He was given conditional bail to appear before Bankstown Local Court on April 11.

French Interior Minister Gérald Darmanin told radio station RTL on Friday that 310 people were arrested overnight, most of them in Paris, after protests on Thursday.

Rioters clashed with police during demonstrations on Thursday night, with officers deploying a water cannon as thousands gathered at the Place de Concorde.

Protesters this evening congregated at the public square, with pictures emerging of them huddled around a fire with a cardboard effigy of the French President raised precariously above the flames to chants of 'Macron, Resign!' The cutout was later shown after it had been ignited.

Reuters TV broadcast images of tear gas being used by police to deal with crowd disorder at the Place de Concorde this evening as tensions over the reforms reached melting point. A water cannon vehicle was also pictured.

An AFP image shows water being sprayed onto a large wooden cable reel that had been torched in the public square. Construction equipment had been burned there for the second day in a row, according to reports.

Lines of riot police could also be seen blocking the path leading from the Place de la Concorde to the National Assembly, home to the lower house of the bicameral French Parliament.

French opposition lawmakers have filed a no confidence motion against Macron's government after the controversial bill to raise the retirement age was forced through parliament without a vote.

'The motion will allow us to get out on top of a deep political crisis', said Bertrand Pancher, the head of a left-wing independent parliamentary group that co-signed the motion.

Fury has quickly spread across the streets of Paris as angry protesters disrupted traffic and set cars and barricades ablaze following the bill being forced through parliament.

Demonstrators have also disrupted rubbish collection and university campuses as opponents of the change maintain their resolve to get the government to back down.

Several cars were torched in Paris and other French cities in the evening during demonstrations involving several thousand people. Trade unions mobilised workers to briefly block a Paris ring road.

Angry critics, political opponents and labor unions around France all blasted Macron for his decision to ram the bill raising the retirement age from 62 to 64 through the legislature.

The formal no confidence vote will likely take place early next week.

Macron ordered Borne on Thursday to wield a special constitutional power to push the highly unpopular pension bill through without a vote in the National Assembly, France's lower house of parliament.

His calculated risk infuriated opposition lawmakers, many citizens and unions.

The French are deeply attached to keeping the official retirement age at 62, which is among the lowest in European countries.

More than eight out of 10 people are unhappy with the government's decision to skip a vote in parliament, and 65 per cent want strikes and protests to continue, a Toluna Harris Interactive poll for RTL radio showed.

On Thursday, thousands gathered in protest at the Place de la Concorde.

As night fell, police officers charged the demonstrators in waves to clear the Place.

Small groups then moved through nearby streets in the chic Champs-Elysees neighborhood, setting off street fires along the way.

Similar scenes repeated themselves in numerous other cities, from Rennes and Nantes in eastern France to Lyon and the southern port city of Marseille, where shop windows and bank fronts were smashed, local French media reported.

The trade unions that had organized strikes and marches against a higher retirement age said more rallies and protest marches would take place in the days ahead.

'This retirement reform is brutal, unjust, unjustified for the world of workers,' they declared.

Macron has made the proposed pension changes the key priority of his second term, arguing that reform is needed to make the French economy more competitive and to keep the pension system from diving into deficit. France, like many richer nations, faces lower birth rates and longer life expectancy.

Macron decided to invoke the special power during a Cabinet meeting a few minutes before a scheduled vote in the National Assembly, where the legislation had no guarantee of securing majority support. The Senate adopted the bill earlier Thursday.

Opposition lawmakers demanded the government to step down. If the expected no confidence motion passes, which requires approval from more than half of the Assembly, it would be a first since 1962 and would force the government to resign. It would also spell the end Macron's retirement reform plan.

Macron could reappoint Borne if he chooses, and a new Cabinet would be named. If the motion does not succeed, the pension bill would be considered adopted.

Addressing the protests, hard-left leader Jean-Luc Melenchon said: 'Something fundamental happened, and that is that, immediately, spontaneous mobilisations took place throughout the country.

'It goes without saying that I encourage them, I think that's where it's happening.'";True;1;0.9580602645874023;high_pos;1

After a second crisis meeting with senior ministers, Macron today said around a third of the 875 people arrested overnight for rioting were 'young, or very young'.

'It's the responsibility of parents to keep them at home,' he told reporters. 'It's not the state's job to act in their place.'

He also claimed social media is playing a 'considerable role' in the spreading unrest and called on firms such as Snapchat and TikTok to remove sensitive content from their sites.

But the French president failed to address the backlash over a clip that emerged of him dancing the night away at an Elton John concert while rioters took to the streets again for a third successive night on Thursday.

He was filmed at Paris's Accor Arena, watching the singer on his farewell tour, while rioters caused mayhem in the capital following the fatal shooting of a French-Algerian 17-year-old identified as Nahel on Tuesday.

Gangs were filmed pillaging shops last night - targeting Zara and Nike stores as well as the high-end shopfront next to the Louvre and the Jardin des Tuileries.

Shocking images taken of the aftermath this morning showed the husks of dozens of burned-out vehicles being hauled away or cordoned off, with storefronts and municipal buildings showing signs of major damage.

Last night, as the officer responsible for the death of Nahel, 17, was remanded in custody charged with murder, mobs stormed into the Chatelet shopping complex close to Notre Dame Cathedral.

'Dozens of youths smashed the windows of sports stores, and then started stealing clothes and shoes' said a police spokesman.

'Businesses hit included a Nike store, fashion boutiques and the Samaritaine department store.

'The attacks spread to other businesses, including a Five Guys fast food restaurant which was vandalised and then set on fire.'

There were similar scenes in cities and towns across France in the early hours of Friday morning, particularly in the southern city of Marseille.

Protesters erected barricades, set cars ablaze and shot fireworks at police as tensions grew.

More than 600 people were arrested around the country as the government struggled to restore order and France's interior ministry said some 249 officers were injured in last night's violence.

Armoured police vehicles rammed through the charred remains of cars that had been flipped and set on fire in the north-western Paris suburb of Nanterre, where the officer shot the 17-year-old on Tuesday.

On the other side of Paris, protesters lit a fire at the city hall of the suburb of Clichy-sous-Bois and set a bus depot ablaze in Aubervilliers. The French capital also saw fires and some stores ransacked.

In the Mediterranean port city of Marseille, police sought to disperse violent groups in the city centre, regional authorities said.

Some 40,000 police officers were deployed to quell the protests. Police detained 667 people, the interior minister said; 307 of those were in the Paris region alone, according to the police headquarters.

Around 200 police officers were injured, according to a national police spokesman. No information was available about injuries among the rest of the population.

Schools, town halls and police stations were targeted by people setting fires, and police used tear gas, water cannons and dispersion grenades against rioters, the spokesman said.

Amid the unrest, the Elysee announced Macron would cut short a trip to Brussels, where he was attending a European Union summit, to chair a crisis meeting on the violence - the second such emergency talks in as many days.

It came as Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin on Friday denounced what he called a night of 'rare violence.' His office described the arrests as a sharp increase on previous operations as part of an overall government efforts to be 'extremely firm' with rioters.

The government has stopped short of declaring a state of emergency - a measure taken to quell weeks of rioting around France that followed the accidental death of two boys fleeing police in 2005.

As his country burned, the French President was snapped arm-in-arm with Elton John - who he bestowed France's Legion of Honour award - alongside his wife Brigitte.

But Macron's photo with the legendary 76-year-old artist ignited outrage overnight, with Thierry Mariani, an MEP with Marine Le Pen's National Rally, raging: 'While France was on fire, Macron applauded Elton John', the Telegraph reported.

The violence continued despite the police officer accused of pulling the trigger being handed a preliminary charge of voluntary homicide.

The rioting broke out after a policeman was accused of executing a teenage driver in cold blood, telling him: 'I'm going to lodge a bullet in your head'. The horrific killing was videoed in Nanterre, to the west of the French capital

There are now also growing concerns of the mayhem spilling out into other corners of Europe after footage emerged on social media of riots starting in areas of Belgium.

Riot police in body armour and wielding shields were seen storming the streets in the Belgium district of Anneessens.

Protesters, some clad in hoodies and wearing masks, clashed with the authorities as they torched cars and used fireworks as weapons in the streets.

About a dozen people were detained during scuffles related to the killing in France, with Belgian police spokesman Ilse Van de Keere saying several fires were brought under control, and that at least one car was burned.

Prosecutor Pascal Prache has said his initial investigation led him to conclude 'the conditions for the legal use of the weapon were not met'.

After a crisis meeting yesterday following Tuesday night's violence, interior minister Gerald Darmanin said the number of officers in the streets would more than quadruple, from 9,000 to 40,000 on Thursday. In the Paris region alone, the number of officers deployed would more than double to 5,000.

'The professionals of disorder must go home,' Mr Darmanin said.

While there is no need yet to declare a state of emergency - a measure taken to quell weeks of rioting in 2005 - he added: 'The state's response will be extremely firm.'

He said officers made more than 180 arrests before Thursday and that there would 'doubtless' be more.

Bus and tram services in the Paris area were shutting down before sunset as a precaution to safeguard transportation workers and passengers.

The town of Clamart, home to 54,000 people in the French capital's south-west suburbs, said it was taking the extraordinary step of putting an overnight curfew in place from Thursday through to Monday, citing 'the risk of new public order disturbances.'

The mayor of Neuilly-sur-Marne announced a similar curfew in that town in the eastern suburbs of Paris.

Marseille, the giant port city in the south of France saw the beginnings of unrest on Thursday evening, with several hundred young people roaming the city centre and setting fire to rubbish containers, including in front of the region's main administrative building, police said.

Officers dispersed most of the about 400 people who had gathered, police said. Police arrested three people and one officer was injured.

The unrest extended even to Brussels, where about a dozen people were detained during scuffles related to the shooting in France. Police spokeswoman Ilse Van de Keere said several fires were brought under control, and that at least one car was burned.

The shooting captured on video shocked the country and stirred up long-simmering tensions between police and young people in housing projects and other disadvantaged neighbourhoods.

The teenager's family and their lawyers have not said the police shooting was race-related and they did not release his surname or details about him.

It came as Nahel's mother, Mounia, sheared details of her final moments with her son before his death Tuesday.

'He was everything to me, and that son of a bitch shot him,' she said on Instagram through tears.

The teen's family said they will 'never forgive' the police officer for the death, as a witness called the shooting an 'execution'.

'He gave me a big kiss and told me he loved me, I told him to be careful,' the grieving mother said. 'We left the house at the same time and went to McDonalds, then I went to work like everyone.

'An hour later my son was shot. What do I do now?

'I only had one, he was my best friend, my son, we were so close, thank you all for your support, I don't know what else to say.'

'I will never forgive them,' Nahel's grandmother added.

'My grandson died, they killed my grandson. We are not happy at all, I am against the government.

'They killed my grandson, now I don't care about anyone. They took my grandson from me, I will never forgive them in my life, never, never, never.'

Mounia also gave her first media interview since the shooting, telling the France 5 channel: 'I don't blame the police, I blame one person: the one who took the life of my son.'

She said the 38-year-old officer responsible, who was detained and charged with voluntary manslaughter on Thursday, 'saw an Arab face, a little kid, and wanted to take his life'.

The memorial march for Nahel, led by Mounia, ended with riot police firing tear gas as several cars were set alight in the western Paris suburb of Nanterre, where the teenager lived and was killed.

Heightened security appeared to do little to deter unrest Thursday night.

In the city centre of Marseille, a library was vandalised, according to local officials, and scuffles broke out nearby when police used tear gas to disperse a group of 100 to 150 people who allegedly tried to set up barricades.

Multiple public buildings were also targeted in Seine-Saint-Denis, in the Paris metro area, according to a police source.

In the suburb of Drancy, rioters used a truck to force open the entrance to a shopping centre, which was then partly looted and burned, a police source said.

Firefighters in the northern municipality of Roubaix, meanwhile, dashed from blaze to blaze throughout the night, with a hotel near the train station also catching fire, sending its dozen or so residents fleeing into the streets.

In Nanterre, the epicentre of the unrest, tensions rose around midnight, with fireworks and explosives set off in the Pablo Picasso district, where Nahel had lived, according to an AFP journalist.

The government is desperate to avoid a repeat of 2005 urban riots, sparked by the death of two boys of African origin in a police chase, during which 6,000 people were arrested.

Macron has called for calm and said the protest violence was 'unjustifiable'.

The riots are a fresh challenge for the president, who had been looking to move past some of the biggest demonstrations in a generation sparked by a controversial rise in the retirement age.

Nahel's death instantly inflamed raw nerves in neighbourhoods that have welcomed generations of immigrants from France's former colonies and elsewhere. Their France-born children frequently complain that they are subjected to police ID checks and harassment far more frequently than white people or those in more affluent neighbourhoods.

Mr Prache, the Nanterre prosecutor, said officers tried to stop Nahel because he looked so young and was driving a Mercedes with Polish licence plates in a bus lane.

He ran a red light to avoid being stopped then got stuck in traffic. Both officers involved said they drew their guns to prevent him from fleeing.

The officer who fired a single shot said he feared he and his colleague or someone else could be hit by the car, according to Mr Prache. The officers said they felt 'threatened' as the car drove off.

He said two magistrates are leading the investigation, as is common in France. Preliminary charges mean investigating judges strongly suspect wrongdoing but need to investigate more before sending the case to trial. The police officer was in provisional detention, prosecutors said.

Despite a beefed-up police presence, violence resumed for a second night on Wednesday, with protesters shooting fireworks and hurling stones at police in Nanterre, who fired repeated volleys of tear gas.

As demonstrations spread to other towns, police and firefighters struggled to contain protesters and extinguish blazes.

Schools, police stations, town halls and other public buildings were damaged from Toulouse in the south to Lille in the north, with most of the damage in the Paris suburbs, according to a national police spokesperson.

Fire damaged the town hall in the the Paris suburb of L'Ile-Saint-Denis, not far from the country's national stadium and the headquarters of the Paris 2024 Olympics.

Mr Darmanin said 170 officers had been injured in the unrest but none of the injuries was life-threatening. At least 90 public buildings were vandalised. The number of civilians injured was not immediately released.

Scenes of violence in France's suburbs echo 2005, when the deaths of 15-year-old Bouna Traore and 17-year-old Zyed Benna led to three weeks of nationwide riots, exposing anger and resentment in neglected, crime-ridden suburban housing projects. The two boys were electrocuted after hiding from police in a power substation in a Paris suburb.

The violence this time has spread faster than in 2005, although it has not matched the nationwide scale and sustained intensity of those riots.

There were contradicting accounts about what happened to the two teenagers in 2005, while the video of Nahel's shooting immediately galvanised anger. Social media that did not exist two decades ago has also amplified unrest this time.

French President Emmanuel Macron held an emergency security meeting on Thursday about the violence.

'These acts are totally unjustifiable,' Macron said at the beginning of the meeting, which aimed at securing hot spots and planning for the coming days 'so full peace can return'.

Macron also said it was time for 'remembrance and respect' as Nahel's mother called for a silent march on Thursday that drew a large crowd to Nelson Mandela Square, where he was killed.

Some marchers had 'Justice for Nahel' printed on the front of their T-shirts. 'The police kill' read one marcher's placard.

Bouquets of orange and yellow roses marked the site of the shooting.

But fights erupted in areas near the Houses of Parliament and Trafalgar Square, as some demonstrators assaulted police officers with foul-mouthed chants and missiles, smoke grenades and flares.

Shards of glass were strewn along the streets close to the Cenotaph on Whitehall after bottles were thrown at police officers clad in riot gear.

A man urinated next to a memorial dedicated to police officer Keith Palmer, who was killed in the 2017 Westminster terror attack amid violent clashes between far-right protesters and police in central London.

MP Tobias Ellwood, who gave first aid to PC Palmer as he lay dying after being stabbed to death in the grounds Parliament by Khalid Masood, said the image of the man urinating next to the memorial was 'abhorrent'.

The Tory MP for Bournemouth East and chairman of the Defence Select Committee, tweeted a picture of the man and wrote: 'Absolute shame on this man.

'Of all the images to emerge over these few testing days I find this one of most abhorrent. Please help identify him.'

Scotland Yard said that as of 5pm on Saturday, they had arrested five people for offences including violent disorder, assault on police, possession of an offensive weapon, being drunk and disorderly and possession of Class A drugs.

By around 5.30pm, London Ambulance Service said it had treated 15 people for injuries, including two police officers.

Six of these patients, all members of the public, had to be taken to hospital.

The Metropolitan Police Federation chairman, Ken Marsh, condemned the 'disorder and unruliness', and suggested the man pictured urinating next to the memorial should be sent to prison.

He said: 'It's horrendous. The man urinating next to Keith Palmer's memorial is disgusting.

'A faction of people today only had one intention - to be violent and unlawful, they didn't come here to protect the statues, it's just disorder and unruliness.

The violent scenes are in contrast with peaceful demonstrations that took place at Hyde Park and Marble Arch by anti-racism protesters in support of the Black Lives Matter (BLM) movement.

On Friday, statues in Parliament Square - including of Winston Churchill, Nelson Mandela and Mahatma Gandhi - were boarded up to prevent them being targeted by protesters both from the Black Lives Matter movement and far-right groups.

The Metropolitan Police warned people joining demonstrations on Saturday that they must be off the streets by 5pm or risk being arrested.

The violence has been condemned by the Mayor of London Sadiq Khan and Home Secretary Priti Patel, with the latter branding it as 'thoroughly unacceptable thuggery'.

Speaking before the clashes, Paul Golding, leader of Britain First, said the crowds had turned out to 'guard our monuments'.

Mr Golding, who was convicted of a terror offence last month, told the PA news agency: 'I am extremely fed up with the way that the authorities have allowed two consecutive weekends of vandalism against our national monuments.'

There were similar gatherings on Saturday in Belfast, Glasgow and Bristol with crowds massing around monuments.

https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/jan/11/trump-protests-us-states-fbi-alert-state-capitols;FBI reportedly on alert for armed pro-Trump protests in 50 states and Washington;"Michigan banned the open carry of guns inside its Capitol building on Monday, following mob violence last week at the US Capitol and last year’s storming of the Michigan statehouse.

The Michigan ban came as reports detailed FBI warnings about possible violence at state capitols and in Washington in the run-up to the 20 January inauguration of Joe Biden.

An FBI report on 29 December, quoted by Yahoo News, warned that “some [Trump] followers indicated willingness to commit violence in support of their ideology, created contingency plans in the event violence occurred at the events, and identified law enforcement security measures and possible countermeasures”.

In Washington last Wednesday, a US Capitol police officer and four others died in an attack by Trump supporters. Political fallout from that event continues in parallel with a federal effort to arrest participants in the insurrection.

Donald Trump has said he will leave power but has not dropped his baseless claim that his election defeat was caused by voter fraud.

Security officials are preparing for a large crowd in Washington for the inauguration, and state officials are preparing for protests.

On Monday, ABC News reported a similar FBI bulletin warning of armed protests “at all 50 state capitols” and in Washington, but neither the date of that bulletin nor the evidentiary basis for its advice was given.

ABC reported that the FBI was monitoring plans for armed protests against Trump’s election defeat between Saturday and 20 January. The outlet said it had obtained an internal bulletin that detailed calls for the “storming” of state, local and federal courthouses and buildings, if Trump is removed from power before inauguration day.

House Democrats formally introduced an article of impeachment on Monday, charging Trump with inciting an insurrection in regard to the riot at the US Capitol, which has led to multiple arrests.

Democrats also called on Vice-President Mike Pence to implement the 25th amendment to the constitution and remove Trump from power. That effort seems unlikely to succeed. Any impeachment trial in the Senate is not likely to be held until after Trump has left office.

Nonetheless, the ABC reporter Aaron Katersky said the FBI had “received information about an identified armed group intending to travel to Washington DC on 16 January [Saturday]. They have warned that if Congress attempts to remove [Trump] via the 25th amendment a huge uprising will occur.”

Security around the Capitol has been stepped up.

Armed men stormed the Michigan capitol in April, protesting social restrictions aimed at curbing the spread of Covid-19. It later emerged that a group had plotted to kidnap and perhaps kill the governor, the Democrat Gretchen Whitmer.";True;1;0.9560204148292542;high_pos;1
https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8377833/Protests-held-New-York-Washington-DC-riots-broke-out.html;Army deployed to US streets for first time since 1992 LA riots as George Floyd protests kick off;"Four cops were shot in St Louis last night as America was gripped by a seventh straight night of destruction in the wake of George Floyd's death despite Donald Trump's threats of military force.

Rioters opened fire and wounded four officers in St Louis while others hurled rocks, launched fireworks and poured gas over cops in scenes of 'mayhem' on Monday night.

An emotional police chief condemned the looters who were 'tearing up cities' with 'no intention of doing anything constructive' as he revealed the four injured officers were in hospital but likely to survive.

Another cop was reportedly on life support today after he was shot in the head in Las Vegas in one of two outbreaks of gunfire in the city.

Donald Trump showed no sign of backing down last night as he threatened to mobilize 'thousands and thousands' of soldiers in cities across the country to bring the 'riots and lawlessness' to an end.

While he spoke, police were firing tear gas to disperse protesters outside the White House - clearing the way for Trump to stroll across Lafayette Square for a photo opportunity at a historic fire-damaged church.

In New York City, looters descended on luxury stores for a second night in a row as peaceful protests gave way to looting when the sun went down - including at the Macy's flagship store.

The NYPD had dispatched a fleet of officers in a bid to prevent the destruction of the night before but one cop was beaten on a sidewalk while others were powerless to stop the looting.

In Buffalo, New York, shocking video showed police confronting a group of protesters in the street before a car rammed into officers. Officials said two people were injured in that incident.

Clashes between police and protesters broke out in many other cities including Minneapolis, Washington DC, Philadelphia and in the Chicago suburb of Cicero, where two people were fatally shot and at least 60 others were arrested.

What is St John's Episcopal Church? St John's Episcopal Church stands across Lafayette Square from the White House - giving it the nickname of 'Church of the Presidents'. The church held its first service in October 1816, when James Madison was president, and every president since Madison has attended a service there. Pew 54 is reserved for the president whenever he visits in a tradition dating back to Madison's day. St John's also has a link to Revolutionary War hero Paul Revere, whose son Joseph cast the bell for the church steeple in 1822. President James Monroe approved a $100 public contribution towards the bell, which has been in constant use ever since. The church also had a set of stained glass windows manufactured in France which were installed at St John's in the 1880s. Advertisement

The US has been rocked by six straight nights of tumult since George Floyd, a black man, was killed in Minneapolis after a white police officer pinned him to the ground by kneeling on his neck last Monday.

Floyd, who was in handcuffs at the time, died after the white officer ignored bystander shouts to get off him and Floyd's cries that he couldn't breathe.

His death, captured on citizen video, has sparked days of protests in Minneapolis that quickly spread to cities across America.

Trump told reporters his administration is 'fully committed' to serving justice for George Floyd, but said he believed the looters and violent protests are distracting from that goal.

He declared himself the 'president of law and order' and threatened to invoke the Insurrection Act of 1807 to deploy the military.

While Trump spoke, police were heard firing tear gas and deploying flash bangs in an effort to disperse protesters chanting: 'Don't shoot' in Lafayette Park outside the White House.

'All Americans were rightly sickened and revolted by the brutal death of George Floyd,' Trump said.

'My administration is fully committed that for judge and his family, justice will be served. He will not have died in vain.

'But we cannot allow the righteous cries of peaceful protesters to be drowned out by an angry mob. The biggest victims of the rioting is peace loving citizens in our poorest communities. And as their president, I will fight to keep them safe. I will fight to protect you.

'I am your president of law and order and an ally of all peaceful protesters. But in recent days, our nation has been gripped by professional anarchists, violent mobs, arsonists, looters, criminals, rioters, Antifa and others.'

He then revealed his intention to invoke the Insurrection Act, saying: 'I will deploy the United States military and quickly solve the problem for them. I am also taking swift and decisive action to protect our great capitol, Washington, DC. What happened in this city last night was a total disgrace.'

'Those who threaten innocent life and property will be arrested, detained and prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law. I want the organizers of this terror to be on notice that you will face severe criminal penalties and lengthy sentences in jail.'

Between 200 and 250 military personnel from a unit at Fort Bragg in North Carolina were reportedly expected to arrive in DC as early as Monday night, three Pentagon officials told CNN.

The deployment marks the first time that the Army has been sent in to patrol US streets in nearly 30 years since the 1992 Los Angeles riots sparked by the brutal police custody death of Rodney King.

The troops are expected to provide security in the capital but will not perform law enforcement duties such as arrest and detention of protesters or rioters, per CNN.

Police chief John Hayden said a peaceful protest had been replaced by rioters who 'obviously had no intention on protesting or doing anything constructive' and started looting 'all over downtown'.

'They were throwing fireworks on officers, fireworks were exploding on officers, there were officers that had gas poured on them, and we're trying to figure out what is going on,' he said.

'All of this because people decided to steal and break windows, that's all they're doing. I don't understand what that has to do with Mr Floyd's death.'

While many of the demonstrations around the country have been peaceful protests by racially diverse crowds, others have descended into violence - despite curfews in many cities across the US and the deployment of thousands of National Guard members over the past week.

In Minneapolis on Monday, Floyd's brother, Terrence, pleaded for peace at the site where the black man was pinned to the pavement by officer Derek Chauvin, saying violence is 'not going to bring my brother back at all'.

'Let's switch it up ya'll. Let's switch it up. Do this peacefully, please,' Terrence Floyd said.

The crowd chanted: 'What's his name? George Floyd!' and 'One down, three to go!' in reference to the four officers involved in Floyd's arrest.

Chauvin has been charged with murder, but protesters are demanding that his colleagues be prosecuted too. All four were fired.

During an impromptu eulogy, Terrence Floyd urged people to stop the violence and use their power at the ballot box.

'If I'm not over here messing up my community, then what are you all doing?' he said. 'You all are doing nothing. Because that's not going to bring my brother back at all.'

In New York City, peaceful protests on Monday afternoon were followed by reports of looting after sundown.

Stores on 5th and Madison avenues were seen boarding up their with plywood to prevent vandals from breaking in while cops stood guard near shops with already shattered windows, including The Nintendo Store, Michael Kors, Kate Spade and Barnes & Noble.

One NYPD officer was brutally beaten by protesters and held down on the floor as a man repeatedly hit him with a large object.

An onlooker who was filming the attack in the Bronx yelled 'f*** 12', slang criticising the police's drug enforcement unit.

Hours earlier New York Governor Andrew Cuomo announced an 11pm to 5am curfew for New York City in a bid to curb the violence of the past few nights.

Police were seen arresting several people for breaking curfew as the night went on.

Philadelphia also announced a curfew beginning at 8.30pm Tuesday after Monday's protests took a chaotic turn with police firing tear gas and spraying chemicals at demonstrators gathered on the Benjamin Franklin Parkway.

Hanania told WGN that 'outside agitators' have entered Cicero 'after being rebuffed by the closure of downtown Chicago'.

He said the only shots fired were by those agitators, and blamed looting in the town on them as well.

More than 100 local cops are currently patrolling the streets of Cicero with assistance from about 120 county and state police officers.

States that have called in the National Guard As of Monday morning, National Guard Soldiers and Airmen were activated in 23 states and the District of Columbia, 'in response to civil disturbances', the bureau said. That brings the total number of Guard members on duty to nearly 62,000. These are the states that, according to CNN, have already called on the National Guard in the wake of George Floyd's death: Arizona Arkansas California Florida Illinois Michigan Nebraska Nevada Oklahoma Oregon Virginia Colorado Georgia Indiana Kentucky Minnesota North Carolina Ohio Pennsylvania South Carolina South Dakota Tennessee Texas Utah Washington Wisconsin The District of Columbia Advertisement

The country has been beset by angry demonstrations for the past week in some of the most widespread racial unrest in the US since the 1960s.

Spurred in part by Floyd's death, protesters have taken to the streets to decry the killings of black people by police.

While police in some places tried to calm tensions by kneeling or marching in solidarity, officers elsewhere were accused of treating protesters with the same kind of heavy-handed tactics that contributed to the unrest in the first place.

Around the country, political leaders girded for the possibility of more of what unfolded over the weekend: protesters hurling rocks and Molotov cocktails at police in Philadelphia, setting a fire near the White House and smashing their way into Los Angeles stores, running off with as much as they could carry.

At least 4,400 people have been arrested for offenses such as stealing, blocking highways and breaking curfew.

President Trump has berated most of the nation's governors as 'weak' for not cracking down harder on the lawlessness that has convulsed cities from coast to coast.

He told the nation's governors in a video conference that they they 'look like fools' for not deploying even more National Guard members.

'Most of you are weak,' he said.

'You've got to arrest people, you have to track people, you have to put them in jail for 10 years and you'll never see this stuff again.'

Over the weekend the Pentagon reportedly took the rare step of ordering the Army to put several active-duty US military police units on the ready to deploy to Minneapolis.

Soldiers from Fort Bragg in North Carolina and Fort Drum in New York had been ordered to be ready to deploy within four hours if called, according to three people with direct knowledge of the orders.

Soldiers in Fort Carson, in Colorado, and Fort Riley in Kansas were also told to be ready within 24 hours.

The people did not want their names used because they were not authorized to discuss the preparations.

The get-ready orders were sent verbally on Friday, after Trump asked Defense Secretary Mark Esper for military options to help quell the unrest in Minneapolis after protests descended into looting and arson in some parts of the city.

Trump made the request on a phone call from the Oval Office on Thursday night that included Esper, National Security Advisor Robert O'Brien and several others.

The president asked Esper for rapid deployment options if the Minneapolis protests continued to spiral out of control, according to one of the people, senior Pentagon official who was on the call.

'When the White House asks for options, someone opens the drawer and pulls them out so to speak,' the official said.

The person said the military units would be deployed under the Insurrection Act, which was last used in 1992 during the riots in Los Angeles that followed the Rodney King trial.

Roughly 800 US soldiers would deploy to the city if called.

Minnesota Governor Tim Walz ordered 500 of his National Guard troops into Minneapolis, St Paul, and surrounding communities.

But a Pentagon spokesman said Walz did not ask for the Army to be deployed to his state.

'The Department has been in touch with the Governor and there is no request for Title 10 forces to support the Minnesota National Guard or state law enforcement.' Title 10 is the US law that governs the armed forces, and would authorize active duty military to operate within the US.

Active-duty forces are normally prohibited from acting as a domestic law enforcement agency. But the Insurrection Act offers an exception.

The Insurrection Act will allow the military to take up a policing authority it otherwise would not be allowed to do, enforcing state and federal laws, said Stephen Vladeck, a University of Texas School of Law professor who specializes in constitutional and national security law.

The statute 'is deliberately vague' when it comes to the instances in which the Insurrection Act could be used, he said.

The state's governor could ask Trump to take action or Trump could act on his own authority if he's determined that the local authorities are so overwhelmed that they can't adequately enforce the law, Vladeck said.

'It is a very, very broad grant of authority for the president,' he added.

WHAT IS THE INSURRECTION ACT OF 1807? President Donald Trump on Monday suggested he would use federal troops to end unrest that has erupted following the death of George Floyd, an unarmed black man killed in police custody last week. 'If a city or state refuses to take the actions that are necessary to defend the life and property of their residents, then I will deploy the United States military and quickly solve the problem for them,' Trump said during brief remarks at the White House. The demonstrations have been largely peaceful, but police in some cities have used force against journalists and protesters, and protesters have clashed with police. Many US cities have set curfews. To deploy the armed forces, Trump would need to formally invoke a group of statutes known as the Insurrection Act. WHAT IS THE INSURRECTION ACT? Under the US Constitution, governors generally have the authority to maintain order within state borders. This principle is reflected in a law called the Posse Comitatus Act, which generally bars the federal military from participating in domestic law enforcement. The Insurrection Act, which dates to the early 1800s, creates an exception to the Posse Comitatus Act. It permits the president to send in US forces to suppress a domestic insurrection that has hindered the normal enforcement of US law. CAN TRUMP SEND IN TROOPS WITHOUT A GOVERNOR'S APPROVAL? Yes. The law lays out a scenarios in which the president is required to have approval from a state's governor or legislature, and also instances where such approval is not necessary, said Robert Chesney, a professor of national security law at the University of Texas. HAS IT BEEN INVOKED BEFORE? Yes. The Insurrection Act has been invoked on dozens of occasions through U.S. history. Since the civil rights movement of the 1960s, its use has become 'exceedingly rare', according to a report by the Congressional Research Service. The Insurrection Act was last used in 1992, when the acquittal of four Los Angeles police officers in the beating of black motorist Rodney King led to deadly riots. Before that, it was invoked in 1989 during widespread looting in St Croix, Virgin Islands, after Hurricane Hugo. In 2006 the Bush administration suggested using the act to intervene in Louisiana's response to Hurricane Katrina - despite the governor's refusal - but that move was deemed unconstitutional. The act was subsequently amended in 2007 to explicitly allow any emergency hindering law enforcement to be a cause for use of the military. In 2008, the amendment was repealed after the governors of all 50 states issued a joint statement against it. CAN A COURT STRIKE DOWN TRUMP'S APPLICATION OF THE LAW? Chesney said a successful legal challenge to Trump's use of the law was 'very unlikely.' Courts have historically been very reluctant to second-guess a president's military declarations, he said. 'The law, for all practical purposes, leaves this to the president with very little judicial review with any teeth,' Chesney said. - Reporting by Megan Sheets for DailyMail.com and Reuters The Insurrection Act was last used in 1992 during the Rodney King riots (pictured) Advertisement

Former President Barack Obama on Monday condemned the use of violence at nationwide protests over racial inequities and excessive police force while praising the actions of peaceful protesters seeking reform.

The vast majority of protesters have been peaceful, but a 'small minority' were putting people at risk and harming the very communities the protests are intended to help, Obama wrote in an online essay posted on Medium.

Obama said the violence was 'compounding the destruction of neighborhoods that are often already short on services and investment and detracting from the larger cause.'

Obama's latest remarks came three days after his first comments on the Floyd case, which called for justice but did not mention the violent nature of some protests.

His shift in tone on Monday came as some protesters have set fires, smashed windows and looted stores, forcing mayors in large cities to impose nighttime curfews.

https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-13359417/Pro-Palestinian-protests-universities-Jewish-students-campus-woke-Left-UK.html;Pro-Palestinian protests are spreading like wildfire across US universities, with Jewish students advised to stay home and campus chiefs accused of pandering to the woke Left. Now they might reach the UK…;"The drums have been beating for nearly a fortnight at Manhattan’s Columbia University, the noise reverberating around the campus of one of America’s most prestigious seats of learning.

It is energising some students and academics but putting others on edge, for the drums are the accompaniment to ceaseless chants about the virtues of the Palestinian cause and the wickedness of ‘colonial’ Israel.

Protesters insist they are demanding only peace in Gaza and an end to the humanitarian crisis there, and complain that anti-Zionism shouldn’t be confused with anti-Semitism. However, many of the slogans and placards tell a very different story: ‘Brick by brick, wall by wall, Israel will fall’; ‘There is only one solution, intifada revolution’; ‘From the river to the sea, Palestine will be free’ and ‘By any means necessary’.

They call, implicitly or explicitly, for the extinction of Israel.

There have been more than 700 arrests by police breaking up the protests, which have this week spread like wildfire across the US to at least 76 other universities and rising. Many say America is witnessing a crisis in academia that has been years in the making – and might yet spread to the UK.

Pro-Palestinian protesters have launched a wave of protests on campus condemning Israel's offensive on the Gaza Strip, including at New York University

Political alarm has reached the White House, where Joe Biden called on Americans to condemn the ‘alarming surge of anti-Semitism’ on college campuses and elsewhere.

Yet student protests are growing, feeding off each other. Every time police arrive on a campus to end an illegal protest, three or four more sprout up in response at universities elsewhere. It is rapidly becoming a nationwide movement and drawing comparisons with the Vietnam War protests more than 50 years ago.

Critics say that American university chiefs are reaping the whirlwind of years of pandering to woke Left-wing students with whom they frequently agree and, in the specific case of Gaza, losing their moral authority by failing to come down hard on anti-Jewish hate speech when the conflict first erupted. They’re also accused of indoctrinating students to believe that Jews are white and therefore oppressors, while Israel is a colonialist state and therefore illegitimate.

And while protest sympathisers insist the students are simply exercising their rights to free speech, others counter that by disrupting classes with loudhailers and inflammatory chants, and refusing to stop until their anti-Israel demands are met, this is simply a crude exercise in coercion and intimidation.

The situation is so serious at Columbia – an Ivy League institution founded under George II which was originally named King’s College – that a campus rabbi has urged Jewish students to stay at home rather than risk being harassed and abused.

Minouche Shafik, who is the president of Columbia University, told Congress that she was fighting anti-Semitism on her campus

Earlier this month, Columbia’s embattled President, Minouche Shafik, an Egyptian-born Anglo-American and former deputy governor of the Bank of England, told Congress that she was fighting anti-Semitism on her campus. She said several Columbia academics were already under investigation, including Middle Eastern Studies professor Joseph Massad who caused outrage when he described aspects of the October Hamas attack on Israel as ‘awesome’.

A senior colleague of hers at Columbia, Claire Shipman, testified bluntly: ‘We have a moral crisis on our campus.’

Following the Congress hearing, Baroness Shafik – also a former vice-chancellor of the LSE – returned to New York and called in the police after students had been filmed expressing anti-Semitic abuse and support for Hamas.

Officers in riot gear made more than 100 arrests as they cleared a large tented camp on the university’s lawn that protesters have called the ‘Gaza Solidarity Encampment’ and had been set up in breach of Columbia’s demonstration rules. Undaunted, protesters responded by rebuilding the encampment, only bigger, and have vowed they won’t disperse until Columbia agrees, among other demands, to cut academic and financial ties with Israel. Columbia has pledged it won’t use the police again after its university board accused Baroness Shafik of heavy-handedness.

But some of Columbia’s 5,000 Jewish students say they’ve been targeted, vocally and even physically, by the protesters, some of them troublemakers not even connected to the university.

The victims say that simply wearing a Jewish star on their clothing has been enough for demonstrators – many hiding their faces behind keffiyeh scarves – to throw liquids at them and scream in their face. One photographed a protester holding up a sign in front of Jewish students that referred to an armed wing of Hamas and read: ‘Al-Qassam’s next targets’.

And such is the sulphurous state of higher education and the fierce cultural wars being waged at universities that abuse, harassment and protests at Columbia – traditionally a hotbed of student activism with large numbers of both Jewish and Arab students - is rapidly being replicated dozens of times over.

At Yale, where pro-Palestinian protesters have turned part of its campus into a ‘Liberated Zone’, second-year student Sahar Tartak says she and a friend were hounded at a protest there after being identified as ‘visibly Orthodox Jewish students’.

She was treated in hospital after a demonstrator waved a Palestinian flag in her face, jabbing her in the eye. ‘It’s really painful to realise your peers have joined the Nazi Party,’ she said.

Riot police have arrested hundreds more protesters at universities including Yale, New York, Princeton, Southern California, the University of Texas at Austin, and Emerson in Boston after they all set up their own Gaza encampments in solidarity with their Columbia brethren.

‘BPD, KKK, IDF they’re all the same,’ chanted protesters at Emerson – lumping together the Boston Police Department and the Ku Klux Klan with the Israeli Defence Force military - as more than a hundred, including two professors, were loaded into police vans. At Emory in Atlanta, police used chemical irritants and, in one instance, a stun gun on protesters.

Student encampments have also appeared at Harvard, the University of California in Berkeley, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), and myriad other well-heeled private universities.

Some have pointed out that the encampments are for the most part cropping up on the smartest campuses whose wealthy students often have the luxury of not needing to hurry off after classes to a part time job.

Detractors have also ridiculed the way the protesters and their supporters on the Left, after years in which conservative voices have been relentlessly silenced on campuses, are only now complaining about preserving free speech in universities.

And, of course, it’s not just the students who are up in arms. Faculty members and lecturers are showing solidarity with the demonstrators. At Columbia, they have even donned ‘Hands Off Our Students’ T-shirts.

Columbia’s Baroness Shafik, an Oxford-educated former permanent secretary at the UK’s Department for International Development, faces calls from both Republicans and Democrats in Congress to step down over what they say is her failure to restore order and protect Jewish students and the faculty itself.

A sign placed near the 'solidarity encampment’ at Columbia University, where students are protesting in support of Palestinians during the conflict between Israel and Hamas

Democrat Senator John Fetterman went so far as to compare the situation at Columbia to the 2017 Unite the Right rally by white supremacists in Charlottesville, Virginia, at which a supporter drove his car into counter-protesters, killing one and injuring 35 others.

House Speaker Mike Johnson, a senior Republican, also called on Baroness Shafik to resign ‘if she cannot immediately bring order to this chaos’ when he visited Columbia on Wednesday. ‘Go back to class and stop the nonsense,’ he told protesters. ‘Stop wasting your parents’ money.’

Perhaps more serious for universities than political condemnation has been the displeasure of financial donors. Private US universities – especially the immensely rich Ivy League elite – are about nothing if not making money and Columbia has now lost the confidence of at least one of its biggest donors.

Robert Kraft, a billionaire Jewish businessman and owner of the New England Patriots football team, has given millions of dollars to the alma mater he says he ‘loves so much’. But now he has ‘lost faith’ in the university and can no longer support it ‘until corrective action is taken’, he said.

Mr Kraft, who set up a foundation to fight anti-Semitism, went on: ‘I am deeply saddened at the virulent hate that continues to grow on campus and throughout our country.’

Kraft’s horror echoes that of alumni benefactors of other ‘Ivies’ who last December helped force out the heads of Harvard and Pennsylvania after they caused widespread revulsion when, questioned in Congress, they said students who called for Jewish genocide wouldn’t necessarily be reprimanded.

Back at Columbia, Baroness Shafik has complained that the ‘tensions have been exploited and amplified’ by non-Columbia activists who have ‘come to campus to pursue their own agendas’.

Certainly, her university allowed in a string of controversial pro-Palestine speakers last week to address the protesters.

Students at Columbia University demonstrated near the Gaza Solidarity Encampment in New York on Thursday

They included activist and writer Mohammed El-Kurd, investigated by the Metropolitan Police after he told protesters in London in January that ‘we must normalise massacres as the status quo’ (El-Kurd later claimed he ‘mis-spoke’).

Academic Cornell West, another Columbia protest speaker, has said that Israel and the US were most to blame for Hamas’s October 7 massacre.

But while they were admitted to the campus one of Columbia’s own Jewish academics was barred from it after he planned a pro-Israel counter-demonstration. He said he was told the university couldn’t guarantee his safety.

‘This is 1938,’ complained Shai Davidai, an assistant professor at the Business School, echoing a common comparison that critics have drawn to that watershed year in Nazi Germany’s persecution of Jews.

John McWhorter, a black professor at Columbia and New York Times columnist, meanwhile highlighted what he saw as the shameless hypocrisy of those who have defended the protests. ‘I thought about what would have happened if protesters were instead chanting anti-black slogans, or even something like “D.E.I. [Diversity, Equity and Inclusion] has got to die,” to the same “Sound Off” tune that “From the river to the sea” has been adapted to,’ he said.

Police intervene at a demonstration at New York University, where students protest in solidarity with those at Columbia University

‘They would have lasted roughly five minutes before masses of students shouted them down and drove them off the campus.’

Why, he asked, ‘do so many people think that weeks-long campus protests against not just the war in Gaza but Israel’s very existence are nevertheless permissible?’.

Meanwhile, at the centre of the storm, a festival atmosphere reigns at Columbia’s reconstructed ‘solidarity encampment’ where some 100 tents have been pitched. Volunteers hand out face masks on entry (so useful to avoid identification) and offer art classes and poetry readings, not to mention organic snacks and bagels. When not chanting slogans and dancing, many protesters spend their days hunched over their studies - though still keeping a watchful eye out for ‘Zionist’ intruders against whom they have been seen linking arms.

A student spokesman for the pro-Palestinian protest said this week that they’ll stay until forcibly removed. ‘When you try to repress us, the movement only grows,’ she warned. In that, at least, she seems to be entirely correct.";True;1;0.9567161798477173;high_pos;1

A Kill the Bill rioter who set fire to a police van and used an officer's shield to fan the flames has been jailed for five years.

Matthew O'Neill, 31, admitted charges of riot and arson at a previous hearing at Bristol Crown Court on what would have been the first day of his trial.

Footage from March 21, 2021 showed O'Neill using lit items to set a police vehicle on fire.

O'Neill, of Patchway, South Gloucestershire, also wielded a chair to smash the front window of a police van already well ablaze.

He also used a police shield and baton to attack officers, as well as cause damage to the front of Bridewell Police Station.

At today's hearing, Judge Patrick said O'Neill was part of a group which 'hijacked' a peaceful protest that 'became aggressive in an immediate, menacing and threatening way'.

Following 16 other prosecutions, the total amount of prison time handed out for the riot amounts to 65 years and five months, which police said sends a 'clear message' to would be rioters.

A video shared online (pictured) showed the moment O'Neill accessed the underside of the police van via the wheel arches, and then used a police shield to fan the flames

Judge Patrick said: 'Officers were struck, spat on, kicked and punched, and dragged into the crowd away from their colleagues. They were dehumanised throughout this disorder.

'Operationally this was a very difficult situation to police. Your behaviour was criminal and far exceeded anything that can be described as a lawful protest.

'By your plea, you accept that you were part of at least 12 people causing, threatening or using violence against police officers.

'The incident caused serious distress, damage and a considerable amount of expense which needs to be paid by the public purse.'

Det Supt James Riccio said: 'Matthew O'Neill chose to use the uncontrollable weapon of fire during the wanton violence he engaged in on that night.

Detective Superintendent James Riccio said that by using 'the uncontrollable weapon of fire'. O'Neill had showed no regard to the safety or welfare of others

The police van can be seen in the video covered in graffiti, with flames developing underneath

O'Neill lit items and placed them underneath the police van to set the vehicle alight

'The change in plea on what would have been the first day of his trial is testament to the compelling visual evidence against him, meticulously collated by our team of investigators.

'O'Neill is the seventeenth person to be jailed for offences committed during the riot so far.

'The combined sentence handed out by the court is now 65 years and five months.

'This sends out a clear and compelling message that violence and destruction will not be tolerated and if you engage in that kind of behaviour, you can expect to be brought to justice for your actions.'";True;1;0.9501668810844421;high_pos;1

Footage shows the demonstration on Whitehall, central London turning violent as protestors bombard mounted officers with missile - and even Boris bikes - after hours of peaceful rallies drew to a close.

Through piecing together pictures, bystanders' videos and eye-witness accounts at the scene, this how the dramatic situation unfolded.

A female police officer was injured after her horse slammed her into a traffic light, sending its rider flying to the ground after being spooked by projectiles thrown by protestors

Terrified horse hit by missiles and bolts

Shocking footage show a horse on Whitehall in a state of panic after being hit with missiles such as glass bottles and flares thrown by protestors.

The horse's female rider struggles to stay in control as she rides the animal down the street charging protestors.

But within seconds the horse slams into a traffic light, sending its rider flying to the ground amid shocked gasps from onlookers.

The runaway police horse then turns back on itself, slamming a demonstrator to the ground as it attempts to flee the scene

Riderless horse hits protestor

The now-riderless horse continues to look to escape the crowds, scattering protestors as they attempt to get out of its path.

But then, after violently changing direction, the animal runs directly into a demonstrator, knocking them straight to the ground.

Another bystander then captures the horse running up Whitehall before turning off down Horse Guards Avenue, and eventually making its own way to its stables.

The injured officer is seen being pulled off the street by two other officers and a protestor. Met Police have confirmed she is recovering in hospital

Female officer is hospitalised

In front of Downing Street, two officers and a demonstrator are seen dragging the fallen horse rider out of the street. She is believed to have been knocked unconscious in the fall.

Met Police said last night: ‘The officer is currently in hospital, receiving treatment for her injuries which are not life threatening.

'The officer fell from her horse and we are examining the full circumstances of what took place.’

The Metropolitan Police told MailOnline that they are continuing to investigation the cause of the incident.

Amid an increasingly tense backdrop, protestors continue to throw projectiles at mounted police officers.

A series of photos captures a masked protester wearing a dark blue overcoat and black gloves picking up a Boris bike in front of the Foreign Office.

He then deliberately hurtles the bicycle straight in to the path of a group of police horses.

Witnesses reported another two incidents where bikes were thrown towards horses at around the same time.

One masked man was seen purposefully rolling a Boris bike straight into the path of a mounted horse. Others were seen on social media throwing projectiles such as water bottles at riot police

Bike hits a horse

The bike hits one of the horses on its right side before falling over, causing the horse to rear up as its rider tries to bring it under control.

There are several reports that missiles, possibly a flare, also hit officers on horseback. One bystander said: ‘One flare was an inch from my head.

'It went right past me and hit the officer’s shield. A bike was thrown at the horse.’

A police horse, believed to have a female rider, bolts after being hit with a bicycle. The horse quickly turns and makes its way down Whitehall as terrified crowds scatter to get out of the way

More photos show what appears to be a second horse, in front of strewn Boris bikes, standing on its hind legs before it bolts following the incident.

The Met Police confirmed tonight while they are still investigating what happened, no animals were injured in the protests.

Thousands of protestors took to the streets of London today to protest against police brutality, following the death of US citizen George Floyd at the hands of Minnesota police officer Derek Chauvin.

Protestors congregated in Parliament Square and Downing Street before moving across the other locations in the Capital including Battersea and Victoria.

The scenes on Saturday are the latest in a string of protests to have taken place throughout the week in London.

The demonstrations occurred despite please from Government ministers, including Home Secretary Priti Patel and Health Secretary Matt Hancock, to not break lockdown regulations and attend the protests.

Some protestors were seen wearing face masks and other means of protective equipment.

Elsewhere in London, popular boxer Anthony Joshua attended a Black Lives Matter demonstration in his hometown of Watford.

The heavyweight boxing champion made a passionate speech calling for the need to 'speak out in peaceful demonstrations' and not to protest with 'selfish motives and turning it into rioting and looting'.

Kyrees Sullivan, 16, and Harvey Evans, 15, were killed on Cardiff's Ely housing estate on May 22 of this year, when they crashed on an e-bike minutes after CCTV captured them being followed by a police van.

Tensions between local people and police at the scene led to a riot lasting several hours, during which dozens of officers were injured, property was damaged and cars were set alight.

Best friends Kyrees Sullivan, 15, and Harvey Evans, 16, (pictured together as youngsters) were knocked off their bikes by a vehicle near their homes on Snowden Road in the suburb of Ely

The boys can be seen riding in security footage on their bike at 5.59pm. Five seconds later, a police van is seen following behind them

The Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC), said it is now investigating complaints made about South Wales Police by the two teenagers' families.

The watchdog said it will probe the force's response and management of the collision scene, its treatment of the families at the crash site and police's communication with the families following the two deaths.

The footage of the police van following the boys was reportedly taken on Frank Road – about half a mile from the site of the crash on Snowden Road.

The clip is time-stamped at 5.59pm, with the fatal collision reported to police at 6.03pm.

It was circulated on social media and friends of the boys' families confirmed they believed it showed them sharing the £4,000 e-bike. Neither appeared to be wearing a helmet.

The IOPC previously said the driver of the police van, an officer with South Wales Police, was told they were being criminally investigated for dangerous driving after previously being served with a gross misconduct notice.

Another officer, a passenger in the police van, was also previously served with a gross misconduct notice.

The watchdog said a decision over potential disciplinary proceedings and any referral to the Crown Prosecution Service will be made at the end of the probe.

IOPC director David Ford: 'Our thoughts and sympathies remain with the families and friends of Kyrees and Harvey and everyone impacted by their untimely deaths.

'We are independently investigating several complaints raised by their families, which are mainly centred around their interactions with South Wales Police on the night of the incident and in the following days and weeks.

'This is in addition to our original investigation for which we have obtained and scrutinised a substantial volume of evidence and we continue to make good progress.

'Decisions regarding any disciplinary proceedings and any referral to the Crown Prosecution Service will be made upon the conclusion of our investigation.

'We are updating the boys' families and South Wales Police regularly with our progress on both investigations.'";True;1;0.6551325917243958;border_pos;1

A video shows the moment the apartment block was hit triggering a giant explosion, say reports.

The drone was suspected to have been aimed at a nearby oil depot. Key defence facilities were also in the vicinity.

'Half the house was blown away,' said one resident.

At least 15 apartments were damaged on all five floors of the building on Piskarevsky Avenue in St. Petersburg.

One hundred people were evacuated from the blitzed block, but no casualties were reported.

It was the first attack on St Petersburg in more than one month.

The suspected target in St Petersburg was the Ruchyi oil depot, around half a mile away.

Ukraine has previously hit oil depots in the city and Leningrad region, leading to Russia temporarily halting gasoline exports.

There were unconfirmed reports of a second drone on a night when Russia also hit Odesa, killing two and wounding seven, with six people missing.

The attacks came the day after 128 people in 19 Russian cities were detained as they marked the funeral of Putin foe Alexei Navalny, who was suspected to have been murdered in his Arctic jail on Putin's orders. Most detainees were freed later.

Mourners in Moscow defied the authorities by chanting demands for Russia without Putin and an end to the war in Ukraine.

Crowds following the hearse in Moscow threw red carnations as it passed and could be heard shouting 'Putin is a murderer' and 'Russia will be free'.

There were also unconfirmed reports that Navalny's supporters were arrested as they left their homes to attend the funeral.

It is thought that one of those detained during the ceremony was an opposition politician.

The Kremlin had warned that action would be taken against any 'unauthorised protests' on the day of Navalny's funeral, with 400 having been arrested for laying flowers at memorial sites following the outspoken politician's death two weeks ago.

Riot police, who wore balaclavas, lined the streets around the Russian Orthodox church and police snipers could be spotted on roofs near the scene.

The brief funeral for Alexei Navalny was held two weeks after the president's biggest critic died in an Arctic prison on February 16.

Pictures showed the opposition leader's open casket inside a church on the outskirts of the Russian capital, after the coffin was carried past the large crowd of mourners with some holding red flowers.

Under the heavy police presence, a long queue could be seen forming near the church in the southeast of the capital, with reports saying thousands were in attendance.

It left the Russian Orthodox church again at around 12pm GMT - less than an hour after it entered - on its way to be buried at a nearby cemetery.

As the coffin was driven away, video showed people chanted again: 'Russia without Putin', 'Putin is a killer' and 'We won't forget'.

The rapper appeared on the scene in her new black Rolls Royce and looked on as Offset argued with officers next to his orange Jeep.

Offset, 28, is heard telling the officers who ask him to step away from the car: 'I'm not going nowhere.'

His wife then shouts: 'Let me record this.'

As Offset is led away, she yells loudly: 'No! This is crazy! My husband is not armed. My husband is not armed.'

Offset was later released without charge, and Cardi B's cousin, Marcelo Almanzar, 20, was arrested and charged with gun offenses.

Almanzar was later released several hours later, at 9:35pm, on a $35,000 bail.

The saga began when Offset was pulled over by officers in Beverly Hills on Saturday afternoon, and filmed the incident.

In a video shared to his Instagram Live, the rapper refused to step out of his car while being questioned by cops - one of whom had a weapon drawn.

That officer told Offset there had been a report that he was 'waving guns at people' as he drove through the area. He replied that Trump supporters had hit his car with a flag.

In a statement, the Beverly Hills Police Department told DailyMail.com that it was actually Almanzar who was arrested for the alleged offense.

The statement read: 'Shortly after 5pm, Beverly Hills Police received information from a passerby of a subject who pointed a weapon from a vehicle at him. The passerby provided a license plate to the vehicle, and the vehicle was stopped by patrol units a short distance away.

'After the on-scene investigation, the passenger in the vehicle [Almanzar] was arrested.'

Almanzar has now been charged with carrying a concealed weapon and carrying a loaded firearm in public. He was released on Saturday night on a $35,000 bond.

It's unclear whether he was trying to intimidate or antagonize members of the pro-Trump rally. Cardi B is a prominent Joe Biden supporter.

24 Oct 2020 02.37 BST Experts say that despite the snafus, the election is working without too many hiccups for most Americans. Clara McMichael reports: “There are no more problems now than we would expect to see in a major presidential election, with record high turnout, record enthusiasm to participate and oh, by the way, in the middle of a pandemic,” said David Becker, executive director of the Center for Election Innovation and Research. “So it’s remarkable that things have been going as relatively well as they have.” Even so, many Americans are going to great lengths to vote in person. Mesha Winford, a cybersecurity analyst working in Virginia, said she will drive three and a half hours to vote in North Carolina. And voting is not the only thing she’s looking forward to – she’s been waiting to go to her favorite restaurant – she tweeted that she dreamt she was back home, eating “bbq, cole slaw, hush puppies, fried chicken gizzards and homemade lemonade”. Winford will also see her 85-year-old father, who she last visited in March, afraid she could unwittingly expose him to Covid-19. Now she has a plan: she’ll take a Covid test first, and when she arrives, they’ll plan to see each other at a distance outside his house, or meet briefly at the polling station.

“It’s especially important to him,” Winford said. “Coming from that era, he couldn’t always vote in the African American demographic.” She added that “people’s lives depend on this election”. Jenn Fralick, a traveling registered nurse based in Laredo, Texas, knows that firsthand. Fralick works in her hospital’s Covid-19 unit and during her overnight shift, she signs her name often, using a shorthand scribble to fill out forms. Although Fralick has worked since September along the border, she lives and votes in Jacksonville, Florida, a key battleground state this election. The nurse said she uses three signature variations – sometimes spelling out her first name or sometimes just using her initials – and she doesn’t remember which version she used on her ballot. She’s heard that in some states, if the voter’s signatures don’t match, they’ll reject the ballot. She’s also concerned about postal service delays. She requested an absentee ballot, but if it doesn’t arrive, she’ll fly home to vote. “I’m watching people die, literally.

24 Oct 2020 01.43 BST The CEOs of Twitter and Facebook will testify before the Senate judiciary committee on 17 November, the committee announced. Twitter’s Jack Dorsey and Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg will answer questions from the Republican-led committee on the “platforms’ censorship and suppression of New York Post articles” among other things. Trump and Republicans have been outraged by the platforms’ decision to limit the distribution of the Post articles, which alleged that a dubiously acquired laptop the outlet said belonged to Hunter Biden – Joe Biden’s son – contained documents that implicated the family in corruption. Multiple news outlets have failed to substantiate the allegations. Republican senators initially threatened to subpoena the CEOs. With Democrats boycotting the hearing, Republicans voted to subpoena if the CEOs didn’t voluntarily agree to speak before the committee. Share Updated at 01.54 BST

24 Oct 2020 01.10 BST The United States on Friday was approaching a record for the number of new daily coronavirus cases, as a new study warned that the pandemic is set to cause half a million American deaths by February. From Oliver Milman in New York and Joan E Greve in Washington and agencies: Covid-19 is on course to ravage states across the nation throughout the coming winter and more than 511,000 lives could be lost by 28 February next year, modeling led by scientists from the University of Washington found. This means that with cases surging in many states, particularly the upper midwest, what appears to be a third major peak of coronavirus infections in the US could lead to nearly 300,000 people dying in just the next four months. In the latest ominous sign about the disease’s grip, the US recorded 71,671 new cases of coronavirus on Thursday, the Associated Press reported, while the seven-day rolling average for cases surpassed 61,140, compared with 44,647 two weeks ago. The record was reached on 22 July when the rolling average was 67,293 in the midst of a summer outbreak driven largely by surges of the virus in Florida, Texas, Arizona and California, the agency reported. Meanwhile, the Washington Post reported that according to its own data tracker, the US hit an all-time daily high for new cases on Friday, with a total of more than 81,000. Several states are setting records across the midwest and west for infections and hospitalizations, amid the autumn surge.

23 Oct 2020 23.57 BST ‘Boogaloo Boi’ charged in fire of Minneapolis police precinct during George Floyd protest Lois Beckett A rightwing extremist boasted of driving from Texas to Minneapolis to help set fire to a police precinct during the George Floyd protests, federal prosecutors said. US attorney Erica MacDonald said on Friday that she has charged Ivan Harrison Hunter, a 26-year-old Texas resident, with traveling across state lines to participate in a riot. The charges are the latest example of far-right extremists attempting to use violence to escalate national protests against police brutality into an uprising against the government, and even full civil war. The case also reveals the extent of the coordination between violent members of the nascent far-right “Boogaloo Bois” movement operating in different cities across the country. According to the complaint, Hunter sent multiple private messages on Facebook bragging of his actions in Minneapolis on the night of 28 May and morning of 29 May, writing, “I set fire to that precinct with the Black community,” and, “My mom would call the FBI if she knew.” Video shot that night shows a person later identified as Hunter firing 13 rounds from a semiautomatic assault-style rifle on the 3rd precinct police station while people believed to be looters were inside. He then high-fived another person and shouted, “Justice for Floyd!” according to the complaint. Later, he privately messaged Steven Carrillo, another alleged “Boogaloo Boi” in California, urging him to “go for police buildings”, according to the federal criminal complaint. “I did better, lol,” Carrillo allegedly replied. Hours before Carrillo sent that message, according to the complaint, federal prosecutors say Carrillo had driven to Oakland with an accomplice, and, as protesters were demonstrating blocks away, shot two officers guarding a federal courthouse in downtown Oakland, killing one, David Patrick Underwood. ‘Boogaloo Boi’ charged in fire of Minneapolis police precinct during George Floyd protest Read more Share

23 Oct 2020 23.44 BST Lou Dobbs, a Fox News anchor and Donald Trump loyalist, launched into a tirade against Lindsay Graham, the Republican of South Carolina who is fighting the toughest reelection race of his Senate career. “I don’t know why anyone in the great state of South Carolina would ever vote for Lindsay Graham,” Dobbs said. Many voters in the state have been put off by Graham’s hypocrisy in rushing to appoint Trump supreme court nominee – after refusing to even consider Obama’s nominee. Moderates have also recoiled at Graham’s transformation from a centrist who fashioned himself as someone who could cut through partisan politics, to a Trumpian who has uncritically backed the president. Dobbs has a different gripe: that Graham has yet to “get to the bottom of Obamagate” – a baseless conspiracy theory that Barack Obama plotted to bring down his successor. Graham has “betrayed President Trump at almost every turn” by not investigating the unsubstantiated allegations, Dobbs said. “Senator Graham needs to be tuned out in South Carolina.” Lou Dobbs is telling South Carolina residents not to vote for Lindsey Graham pic.twitter.com/vQ67BZZN6P — Jason Campbell (@JasonSCampbell) October 23, 2020 Share Updated at 00.11 BST

23 Oct 2020 22.51 BST Why Covid-19 is battering Black Chicagoans Most of the city’s deaths are hyper-concentrated in majority-Black neighborhoods. Gloria Oladipo reports: Phillip Thomas, a Black, 48-year-old Chicagoan, was a “great guy” according to his sister Angela McMiller. He was loved by his family and well-liked by his co-workers at Walmart, where he had worked for nine years.

“I didn’t know about how many friends he had until he passed away,” said Angela. Thomas, who was diabetic, died from Covid-19 this past March. After being sick for two weeks and self-quarantining at the recommendation of his doctor, instead of being given an examination, Phillip was then rushed to the hospital, where he died the next day. Naba’a Muhammad, 59, a writer and Chicago South Shore neighborhood resident, with a lung disease, also contracted coronavirus and was hospitalized. But while he was fortunate to access the necessary care, he immediately noted health disparities facing other Black Chicagoans in his community. “Here you have [Donald Trump] who’s got a helicopter flying him to a special wing of a hospital for help when Black people can’t even get an Uber to the emergency room or a Covid test,” he said, referring to the president’s world-class care at the Walter Reed national military medical center on the outskirts of Washington DC, after being diagnosed with coronavirus in early October. In Chicago, Covid-19 is battering Black communities. Despite only accounting for 30% of the city’s population, Black people make up 60% of Covid cases there and have the highest mortality rate out of any racial or ethnic group.

Most Chicago Covid-19 deaths are hyper-concentrated in majority-Black neighborhoods such as Austin on the West Side and Englewood and Auburn Gresham on the South Side. “The racial and ethnic gaps we’re seeing of who gets the virus and who dies from it are not a surprise,” said Linda Rae Murray, a Chicago doctor, academic, social justice advocate and former president of the American Public Health Association as well as the former chief medical officer of the Cook county department of public health. “They are a reflection of structural racism that exists in our society and inequities that are baked into our country.” ‘It’s like they’re waiting for us to die’: why Covid-19 is battering Black Chicagoans Read more Share

https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/10/move-1985-bombing-reconciliation-philadelphia#new_tab;The day police bombed a city street: can scars of 1985 Move atrocity be healed?;"Frank Powell, a Philadelphia police officer who in 1985 was chief of the city’s bomb disposal squad, remembers vividly the moment he was given his instructions. “Wow,” he recalls thinking. “You want me to do that?”

On 13 May 1985 Powell was handed an army-style green satchel containing a bomb made of C-4 plastic explosives of the sort widely deployed in Vietnam. He boarded a state police helicopter, and took up his position balanced precariously on the skids of the aircraft.

“I can’t remember being scared,” he told the Guardian, “though I must have been.”

At 5.27pm as the helicopter rose into a crystal-clear blue sky he carried out his orders. Flying over a largely African American residential neighborhood of west Philadelphia, he lined up his sights, lit the 45-second fuse with a military igniter and followed his orders.

“I reached out and I dropped it. Perfect. It was going right where it was supposed to go.”

It was to lead to one of the great, largely forgotten, outrages of modern America

His target was the roof of 6221 Osage Avenue, a row house which at the time had 13 American citizens inside. They were all members of Move, a group which combined the black liberation struggle with back-to-nature environmentalism.

Each Move member took the last name Africa to signal their commitment to race equality as well as to each other as a family. For years they had been in a running battle with the Philadelphia authorities culminating that May in arrest warrants, for a range of offenses including “terroristic threats”, “riot” and “disorderly conduct”, being served and a standoff ensuing that ended with the dropping of Powell’s bomb on to their house.

It led to one of the great, largely forgotten, outrages of modern America.

After the bomb struck, a fire took hold and began to spread. The police commissioner, Gregore Sambor, critically and fatally decided “to let the fire burn”.

By the following morning 61 homes had been razed to ashes, leaving 250 Philadelphians destitute and homeless.

Only two of the 13 residents of the Move house got out alive.

The remaining 11, including five children aged seven to 13, were similarly reduced to ashes.

As the 35th anniversary of the bombing approaches, efforts are under way to increase public awareness of the atrocity. It was one of the rare times in US history that American civilians were attacked on domestic soil by aerial bombing, another being the dropping of dynamite on to African American homes in Tulsa, Oklahoma, in the bloody race riots of 1921.

Pressure is also mounting ahead of the anniversary for an apology to be issued by Philadelphia. Wilson Goode, the first black mayor of the city, who approved the 1985 attack though he claims to have been ignorant of key aspects of it, has said sorry on several occasions.

But there has never been a formal apology from the city. No one involved in conceiving and carrying out the assault has ever been prosecuted.

In an opinion article in the Guardian, Goode argues that it is now time for Philadelphia to follow his example and issue an official apology. Repeating his “deep and sincere” regrets, he calls on other former and current officials to join him in saying sorry for “indefensible” acts that led to a “horrific outcome”.

“After 35 years it would be helpful for the healing of all involved, especially the victims of this terrible event, if there was a formal apology by the city of Philadelphia. Many in the city still feel the pain of that day – I know I will always feel the pain.”

Goode’s Guardian article is part of a wider two-year effort to bring opposing parties in the Osage Avenue bombing together in a process of “reconciliation”. The discussions, reported here for the first time, began in September 2018 and are ongoing.

The negotiations involve both Move members and city dignitaries. On the city side, they include Goode and Ed Rendell, who was Philadelphia’s district attorney in 1985 and who served the arrest warrants that led to the bombing (he later went on to become governor of Pennsylvania).

Rendell did not respond to Guardian requests for comment. But he has approved a draft resolution of a city apology “for the decisions leading to the devastation that occurred on May 13th, 1985”.

On the Move side, discussions have been led by Mike Africa Jr. He holds a special place in the Move family because he was born in a prison cell – his mother Debbie gave birth to him soon after she was arrested along with his father Mike Africa Sr in a previous police raid on a Move house in 1978.

His parents both served 40 years in prison for the shooting death of a police officer, James Ramp, during the raid, although they along with all of their fellow incarcerated Move members always protested their innocence.

Mike Africa Jr said that his many face-to-face meetings with Goode during the secret talks were “the hardest thing I’ve ever had to do”. His great uncle John Africa, the founder of Move, and his cousin Frank Africa both died in the 1985 fire.

“Wilson Goode for me has always been the boogeyman,” Mike Africa Jr said. “After some meetings with him I came out literally vomiting. He’s the face of the bomb that killed my family, the man who said after the bomb was dropped that if he had to, he would do it again. So to sit in a room with him, even decades later, was gut-wrenching.”

Mike Africa Jr said he disliked the phrase “reconciliation”, preferring “restorative justice”. The initial demand from Move was to have all the remaining seven members of the Move 9 who had been incarcerated after the 1978 siege released – an ambition fulfilled in February.

Now Mike Africa wants to see the release of an associate of Move, the former Black Panther member Mumia Abu-Jamal who has been incarcerated since 1981 for the murder of a Philadelphia police officer. Africa also wants to see some form of reprimand for those who ordered and participated in the 1985 bombing.

Other Move members are skeptical about the value of the talks. One of the doubters is Ramona Africa, who was the only adult to escape the Move house in May 1985 after Powell dropped the bomb.

She told the Guardian how she and 12 others cowered in the basement of Osage Avenue as the house came under blistering attack. Water cannons were unleashed, teargas pumped in, the front of the house blown off with explosives. Then more than 10,000 rounds of ammunition were fired from police submachine guns.

And that was before the bomb was even dropped.

“We were deluged with water and gas,” Ramona Africa told the Guardian. “When that didn’t work to bring us out of the house, they dropped the bomb. The whole house shook.”

Ramona was able to flee through a basement exit along with just one child, Birdie Africa. The other 11 adults and children tried to follow them out but were forced back under a hail of police gunfire, she said, though that account has been disputed over the years by Philadelphia police.

Ramona was badly burned in the fire. For her pains, she was arrested, charged with riot and conspiracy, and spent the next seven years behind bars – the only person ever to be convicted of crimes arising from the attack.

Given her devastating experiences, she is dubious about the prospects of reconciliation. “We don’t want no apology,” she said. “They can’t make up for what they did, they can’t bring our people back who they murdered.”

Janine Africa, one of the Move 9 imprisoned after the 1978 siege, lost her 12-year-old son Little Phil in the bombing. She described the boy to the Guardian as “a very outgoing kid, very adventurous, a little comic”.

Janine bitterly remembers how she learned that her child had diedwhile she was being held in solitary confinement (she was released almost exactly a year ago after 41 years in prison).

She recalled: “The guard opened my cell door and said: ‘Your son is dead,’ then shut the door. That was it. No explanation. Nothing.”

Janine Africa is also unconvinced by the push for an apology. “It’s really insulting to say you’re sorry now, after all these years,” she said.

Despite such reservations, Ulysses Slaughter, a reconciliation strategist who has mediated the talks, is certain the process is needed to heal the wounds that are still open for so many Philadelphians. “The events of 1985 continue to silently traumatize people,” he said.

Five kids died, and the neighbors lost everything. We failed, and it bothers me. Nobody ever seemed to care.

“People need to ask themselves, what have we become as human beings when we allow our neighborhoods to become war zones.”

Several of the more than 500 police officers who took part on the siege on 13 May 1985, as well as firefighters, have also been involved in the reconciliation talks.

Jim Berghaier was on police duty in Osage Avenue that day and helped Birdie Africa escape the conflagration. He told the Guardian that he is haunted by the image of the boy walking through a wall of fire.

“Five kids died, and the neighbors lost everything. We failed, and it bothers me. Nobody ever seemed to care.”

Berghaier said he only found out later that children had been present in the house. “Even to this day I carry a lot of guilt because of those five kids. I was only a wall away from them. People say to me, ‘But you didn’t know,’ but you can’t help thinking about it. They died a horrible death.”

Linn Washington, who reported the events for the Philadelphia Daily News, believes it is long overdue for a formal recognition by the city of the grievous wrong done that day. “You can’t effectively move on until you find that kind of reconciliation. They killed five kids. The police commissioner called them ‘combatants’ – they were kids!”

Jamie Gauthier, the city council member who represents the area of Osage Avenue today, is one of several current elected officials backing an apology. She told the Guardian: “To this day this represents one of the most heinous acts done by a city government against its own people – not just in Philadelphia, but in the entire country.”

Paradoxically, the only person who the Guardian talked to who said they have not had to wrestle with trauma over the past 35 years is the man who dropped the bomb.

Frank Powell is convinced the fire that killed 11 people and devastated the area was not caused by the explosives in his satchel, but by the Move residents who, in his narrative, set fire to their own home in a deluded desire for suicidal martyrdom.

“What we did that day has never bothered me,” he said. “I went up in that helicopter with the truest intentions of getting those people out unharmed. It didn’t happen that way, but it wasn’t our fault. I can live with that.”";True;1;0.7024248838424683;border_pos;1

Sund, 55, said he anticipated a huge turnout of MAGA supporters on January 6 as Congress held a historic joint-session to certify the election.

'We knew it would be bigger. We looked at the intelligence. We knew we would have large crowds, the potential for some violent altercations. I had nothing indicating we would have a large mob seize the Capitol,' he said Sunday to the Washington Post.

To be safe on Monday, two days before the session, he asked House and Senate security officials for permission to request the DC National Guard be placed on standby, but he was turned down, he revealed.

Sund resigned from his post one day following the ransacking of the US Capitol.

It has been revealed that in the build up to the deadly Capitol riot, the FBI visited extremists and urged them not to travel to DC for the rally, according to a Fox News report.

It’s not clear how many extremists were contacted nor how far in advance. The FBI also warned Capitol Police about potential violence on January 6.

On Wednesday Trump gave a speech, urging his supporters to march to the Capitol and 'fight' against lawmakers confirming Biden’s election victory and his lawyer Rudy Giuliani urged their followers to engage in 'trial by combat', creating a perfect storm for the riot.

Washington police said the riot resulted in five deaths, including a Capitol Police officer, and a woman who was shot inside the building, and 70 arrests.

Sund reveals his supervisors were reluctant to take steps to put the Guard on call.

House Sergeant at Arms Paul Irving said he wasn’t comfortable with the 'optics' of formally declaring an emergency before the rally.

Senate Sergeant at Arms Michael Stenger reportedly suggested Sund informally seek out Guard contacts and ask them to 'lean forward' and be on alert in case Capitol Police needed their help, without officially calling upon them ahead of time.

Sund said that was just the tip of the iceberg. He tried five more times to request help and was rejected or delayed.

In the end Sund called Maj. Gen William J Walker, the head of the 1,000-member DC National Guard to ask for help.

In Wednesday's riot Sund's 1,400 officers on duty were outnumbered by an army of 8,000 pro-Trump demonstrators breaking into the Capitol. Sund said he asked for help and the National Guard at least six times but was ignored or delayed

'As soon as they hit the fence line, the fight was on. Violent confrontations from the start. They came with riot helmets, gas masks, shields, pepper spray, fireworks, climbing gear – climbing gear! – explosives, metal pipes, baseball bats. I have never seen anything like it in 30 years of events in Washington,' Sund recalled

He said: 'If we can get you leaning forward how long do you think it would take to get us assistance?'

Walker said he could send 125 personnel quickly.

Sund also spoke with DC Police Chief Robert J. Contee III who offered to help if trouble stirred.

On Wednesday afternoon his forces, numbering 1,400 officers on duty, were outnumbered and overwhelmed by an army of 8,000 pro-Trump demonstrators breaking into the Capitol.

The first wave of MAGA supporters arrived at the Capitol at 12.40pm.

'As soon as they hit the fence line, the fight was on. Violent confrontations from the start. They came with riot helmets, gas masks, shields, pepper spray, fireworks, climbing gear – climbing gear! – explosives, metal pipes, baseball bats. I have never seen anything like it in 30 years of events in Washington,' Sund recalled.

'I realized at 1pm things aren’t going well. I’m watching my people get slammed,' he said.

Contee sent in 100 officers. But by 1.09pm the situation grew dire and Sund called Irving and Stenger asking to call in the Guard. They said they’d 'run it up the chain'.

'If we would have had the National Guard we could have held them at bay longer, until more officers from our partner agencies could arrive,' he said.

By 2pm when the Trump mob breached the Capitol and lawmakers were sent on lockdown, DC police dispatched hundreds of officers to the scene.

Sund joined a conference call to the Pentagon at 2.26pm to ask for back-up.

'I am making an urgent, urgent immediate request for National Guard assistance. I have got to get boots on the ground,' Sund recalled saying.

Lt. Gen. Walter E. Piatt, the director of the Army Staff, said he could not recommend his boss, Army Secretary Ryan McCarthy to approve the request, because he didn’t like 'the visual'.

'I don’t like the visual of the National Guard standing a police line with the Capitol in the background,' Piatt said, according to Sund.

Other officials on the call recall how Sund was desperate for help.

'Literally this guy is on the phone, I mean, Crying out for help. It’s burned in my memorie,' John Falcicchio, the chief of staff for DC Mayor Muriel E. Bowser said.

Finally Acting Defense Secretary Christopher C. Miller verbally authorized the activation of the entire DC Guard at 3.04pm.

In a conference call with the Pentagon around 2.30pm Wednesday Sund begged for back-up but director of Army Staff Lt. Gen. Walter E. Piatt didn’t like the 'visual' of the National Guard at the Capital

But it took more than two hours for those soldiers to leave their homes, pick up their fear from the DC Armory, and arrive on site.

In the end the first round of National Guard personnel arrived at 5.40pm, hours after the breach and after four people died.

Following Wednesday’s chaos, some have criticized DC officials for not preparing in advance or having a riot contingency plan in place – but Sund explains he did ask for help to prepare, but was denied.

Pentagon officials have similarly emphasized that Capitol Police didn’t ask for DC Guard backup.

'We rely on Capitol Police and federal law enforcement to provide an assessment of the situation. And based on that assessment that they had, they believed they had sufficient personnel and did not make a request,' Pentagon spokesman Jonathan Hoffman said in a news conference.

Sund, who was hired as chief in 2019 and worked for 23 years on the DC police force, resigned on Thursday, a day after the riot. He’s a prominent name in the district and helped run 12 national security events including Barack Obama’s 2013 inauguration.

He told his friends he felt he let his officers down.

Under pressure from lawmakers, Stenger and Irving resigned too.

Sund says he only wanted to defend his officers and he’s now worried about the threat of violence n Inauguration Day.

'My concern is if they don’t get their act together with physical security, it’s going to happen again,' he said.

At least two Capitol Police officers died in the wake of the riot. On Sunday it was revealed that US Capitol Police officer Howard Liebengood, 51, (left) died while off-duty Saturday, just three days after the chaos. Fellow officer Brian Sicknick (right) died Thursday after reportedly having been hit over the head by a fire extinguisher during the riots.

Sund says his biggest takeaway from the traumatic event is that America’s democracy needs more security.

'They were extremely dangerous and they were extremely prepared. I have a hard time calling this a demonstration,' he said.

'I’m a firm supporter of First Amendment. This was none of that. This was criminal riotous activity,' he added.

'This is the people’s house. Congress members have always prided themselves on having an open campus. I’m not sure that will continue to be defensible,' he said.

Gainer insisted that Lt. Michael Byrd, who discussed the incident with Lester Holt in an interview that aired on NBC Nightly News on Thursday, had been 'doing his duty.'

'Lt. Byrd was doing his duty, and I think the others that were outside with her in that doorway, yelling and screaming and breaking in there, they owe some responsibility for this too,' Gainer said on CNN's 'New Day' on Friday.

'I feel bad that she got herself in that position,' Gainer said of Babbitt. 'He didn't shoot someone who was a supporter of President Trump. He shot someone who was in the midst of criminal activity. Trying to get in and do harm to members of Congress.'

'Lt. Byrd was doing his duty, and I think the others that were outside with her in that doorway, yelling and screaming and breaking in there, they owe some responsibility for this too,' former Capitol Police Chief Terrence Gainer said on CNN

Ashli Babbitt, above, was shot by a Capitol Police officer as she tried to breach a door near the House chamber on Jan. 6

Gainer said that Babbitt was shot not because she was a supporter of President Trump but becuase she was 'in the midst of criminal activity'

'That hurts, and I know that would trouble her parents, it would trouble me, but he did his job. He did what was expected.'

Gainer said he knows the halls of the Capitol, specifically the door Babbitt was trying to force her way through, 'very, very well.' He said that Babbitt was 'just a few feet' from entering the House chamber where lawmakers were hiding.

'The people doing this weren't people on a stroll in the Capitol,' Gainer said. 'For whatever reason they came in there, at that moment, at that door, on that floor, they were insurrectionists. They were involved in criminal activity. There's no doubt about that.

Gainer said that Capitol Police 'never cared' how someone got elected, or what political persuasion they were.

'The men and women of the United States Capitol Police protect them all equally, and I think Lt. Byrd demonstrated that, and the more people keep trying to turn this into some type of conspiracy theory, some execution, including the ex-president, including sitting members of Congress, are doing an injustice to us all.'

But explaining his decision to finally come forward, Byrd - a 28-year veteran of the force - said: 'I showed the utmost courage on January 6, and its time for me to do that now.'

Referring to the 60 to 80 members of Congress trapped by the riot, he added : 'I know that day I saved countless lives.

'I know members of Congress, as well as my fellow officers and staff, were in jeopardy and in serious danger. And that’s my job,' Lt. Byrd said.

'I'm hearing about the breaches of different barricaded areas, officers being overrun, officers being down.'

Babbitt's family's lawyer said in previous interviews that Babbitt didn't brandish a weapon, wasn't in close proximity to any members of Congress and 'not an imminent threat of death or serious injury to anyone.'

Byrd said he had no idea if the person he shot was carrying a weapon. It was only later that night that he found out the rioter was a woman who was unarmed.

'I was taking a tactical stance. You're ultimately hoping that your commands will be complied with, and ultimately they were not,' Byrd said.

Babbitt's family's lawyer has argued he never gave commands. He told Holt during the interview he yelled multiple times, 'Stop. Get back.'

Then he fired a single fatal gunshot, striking Babbitt in the left shoulder, 'as a last resort.'

'You're taught to aim for center mass the subject was sideways, and I could not see the full motion of her hands or anything so I guess her movement caused the discharge to fall where it did,' Byrd said.

'I tried to wait as long as I could. I hoped and prayed no one tried to enter through those doors.

'But their failure to comply required me to take the appropriate action to save the lives of members of Congress and myself and my fellow officers.'

He was also asked about his thoughts on Donald Trump calling Ashli Babbit's death a 'murder.'

Byrd said: 'It's disheartening, if he was in the room or anywhere and I was responsible for him, I was prepared to do the same for him.'";True;1;0.9292492270469666;high_pos;1
